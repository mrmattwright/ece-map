</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riverdale Kindergarten is located in Riverdale, Gisborne and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. Since the August 2011 ERO report, there have been changes to the operating hours of the kindergarten. It is now licensed for up to 40 children and operates for six hours, Monday to Thursday and for four hours and fifteen minutes on a Friday. Over half the roll identify as M&#257;ori.</p><p>As a result of the change in kindergarten operating hours, additional staff have been appointed. The teaching team is fully qualified and is supported by a teacher aide. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>Over the past three years, Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) has provided in-service support for teachers focusing on assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the association. Two senior teachers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of four kindergartens in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a child-focused and play-based programme for sustained periods of time. They work and play together well, cooperating on shared tasks. Literacy learning experiences are well integrated into the programme. Children&rsquo;s effort and success is celebrated and teachers view children as capable and confident learners.</p><p>The head teacher leads a collaborative team. Teachers are welcoming, responsive and respectful to children and parents. They work alongside children and draw on a range of effective teaching strategies to support and extend their play and learning. Teachers should give greater consideration to how they can promote continuity and extension of learning experiences over the day.</p><p>Independence is promoted. Considerable work has been put in to developing effective strategies to encourage children to regulate their own behaviours. This positively affects the tone and interactions at the kindergarten. Children with additional learning needs are well supported to learn happily and successfully. Teachers work with families and external agencies to improve outcomes for the child.</p><p>Teachers have established &ldquo;critical areas of learning&rdquo; that are valued and strongly promoted in the kindergarten programme. It is unclear how these areas fit with the teaching philosophy. Further strengthening the clarity of the philosophy should assist the evaluation of the curriculum.</p><p>Some teachers use te reo M&#257;ori and integrate aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme. The bicultural programme should continue to be enhanced through teachers investigating local iwi connections. This should then provide a foundation to explore what success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori might look like in this context. Teachers should also consider how strongly Pacific cultures are reflected in the environment, as a first step in supporting success for Pacific children.</p><p>Group planning provides a shared direction for the programme. This process should be developed further through exploring models of planning that support a more child-initiated approach. Profiles information shows that ongoing observation of children in everyday activities builds a picture of their engagement, developing friendships and learning. A next step is to maximise opportunities to embed wh&#257;nau aspirations into the planning cycle. Teachers should also continue to build on recent initiatives to strengthen goal setting and evaluation of the impact on learning.</p><p>Parents have access to transition to school information in the kindergarten. Clear processes are in place to support the child as they transition to school. Teachers should work to establish partnerships with a wider range of contributing schools.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use mathematics in everyday life and through the use of resources for exploration. Teachers' further investigation into the knowledge and language of mathematics should strengthen children&rsquo;s mathematical learning.</p><p>Self review is developing. Teachers should continue to strengthen their understanding of the self-review process and their knowledge of evaluation. This should provide additional information to judge the effectiveness of kindergarten operations and practice and inform future decision making.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust guiding documents and comprehensive policies</li>
<li>clear expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations including health and safety practices</li>
<li>strong leadership</li>
<li>professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound supporting processes for Provisionally Registered Teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Senior teachers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association and use this information to inform decision making. They should also support teachers to build their evaluative capacity to regularly enquire into the effectiveness of their practice to further improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Since the first cluster of these kindergartens the association has reviewed the implementation of the appraisal process. A revised approach is beginning to be put into practice and formal documentation is developing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>continuity and extension of learning</li>
<li>understanding of the philosophy</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>the bicultural programme and success for M&#257;ori and Pacific children</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>undertaking formal strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverdale Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Riverdale Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>3 September 2014<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
