</table><p>Little Owls Preschool has experienced considerable changes in managers and head teachers in 2013 and 2014. A number of systems and practices for centre operations are not well enough developed to sustain and build the capacity of the service.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Owls Preschool is part of St John of God, Waipuna ‚Äì a specialist service that provides a variety of support for youth, young parents and children. It operates under the umbrella of St John of God Hauora Trust and is located in east Christchurch.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for babies to school age children in two separate areas. The nursery caters for infants and toddlers up to two years of age. The preschool caters for children from two years to school age.</p><p>The teachers are all registered early childhood teachers or training to become early childhood teachers.</p><p>In 2014 major extensions and renovations to the centre occurred. The centre now provides spacious, inviting environments in the indoor and outdoor areas for all children, staff and families.</p><p>The managers and staff have made some progress in meeting the recommendations from the 2012 ERO review report. Teachers are focusing more on children‚Äôs learning and are beginning to improve child assessment and programme planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported by their teachers to develop positive, caring and respectful relationships. Teachers have high standards with regards to behaviour management. They are consistent in their approaches, set clear directions and regularly give children praise and affirmation. They have made good use of professional development to provide a secure, welcoming and accepting environment for all children.</p><p>The managers and teachers are inclusive of all children. They have a good knowledge and understanding of each child and their family. They place a strong emphasis on children developing good listening skills and using language to share their ideas and feelings.</p><p>The nursery provides a nurturing environment for infants and toddlers. Teachers are very responsive. Routines are flexible to meet the needs of each child.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments in the preschool and nursery are attractive, inviting and interesting. Activities are easy for children to access and there is plenty of space for children to be physically active or to spend quiet times.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Forty-three percent of the children in the centre roll identify as MƒÅori. The centre does not have a strong bicultural programme, or knowledge to support these children to succeed as MƒÅori.</p><p>Professional development provided by the Ministry of Education (MoE) at the time of the 2014 centre re-licensing is helping staff to better understand and use self review, child assessment and programme planning. However, these new practices are at an early stage and full cycles for self review, child assessment and programme planning have still to be completed.</p><p>The managers and ERO agree that the centre has a number of areas for improvement. These include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing a strong bicultural programme that promotes success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori</li>
<li>clearly defining the centre‚Äôs priorities and goals in annual plans that state how the goals will be achieved, timelines, responsibilities, processes for review and reporting</li>
<li>clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the manager and head teachers and giving them the support that they need to be effective in their roles.</li>
<li>strengthening the performance management system by fully implementing the staff appraisal process, and making closer links between the centre priorities, self review and professional development</li>
<li>continuing to improve self review, child assessment and programme planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Owls Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h4>Development Plan Recommendation</h4><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Owls Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>17 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
