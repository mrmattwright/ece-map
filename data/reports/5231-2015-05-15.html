</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eltham Kindergarten is situated in Eltham, Taranaki. It is one of 24 kindergartens administered by the newly established Kindergarten Taranaki, formerly known as the North and South Taranaki Kindergarten Associations. The board is responsible for setting the overall strategic and policy direction for the organisation. A chief executive has been appointed. Four professional leaders are employed to support learning and development for teachers. The present management structure is under review.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 50 children and has a roll of 44. Mixed-age sessions operate from 8.30am to 2.30pm. All teachers are qualified and registered. Since the July 2012 report, there has been a strengthening of self-review processes involving strategic and curriculum planning, and assessment.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy has clear links to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and this is evident throughout practice. The philosophy is being reviewed to better reflect the bicultural and sustainable processes that are focus goals for the kindergarten.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in Kindergarten Taranaki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Eltham Kindergarten provides a curriculum based on children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and needs. Children are encouraged to develop their independence and to take risks as they learn. They have access to a wide range of choices and resources in a spacious, vibrant environment. Authentic learning contexts are provided for literacy, numeracy and science. There are many deliberate opportunities for literacy learning. Sustained play is evident and well supported by teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten is well set out to stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity, creativity and problem solving. Commitment to environmentally sustainable practices is highly evident. The natural outdoor environment provides challenge and interest.</p><p>Teachers and children maintain positive, sensitive and responsive relationships. Children interact well with each other. Teachers respect children&rsquo;s rights and involve them in decision-making. The kindergarten maintains inclusive practices. There is a collective responsibility for promoting learning for children with specific needs.</p><p>Assessment portfolios demonstrate and support continuity of progress and learning over time. They provide a picture of what children know, understand and can do. Teachers use this to inform their planning. They continue to investigate planning and assessment processes that are most effective in promoting learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The kindergarten environment reflects children&rsquo;s cultures, identities, languages and the local Taranaki context. The kindergarten has a bicultural plan that effectively supports ongoing development of success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori. Teachers continue to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>A considered approach and good processes support children&rsquo;s transition into the centre and to school.</p><p>The head teacher builds capability within the kindergarten through the development of a shared understanding of the goals and plans by providing opportunities for others to lead. Appraisal and performance management is well aligned to the Registered Teacher Criteria, centre goals and priorities and focused on improving teacher practice to promote children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners. They learn together in a culture of collaboration and collegiality.</p><p>There is a focus on strengthening of partnerships between the kindergarten and parents and wh&#257;nau to better support children&rsquo;s learning and foster sense of belonging and identity. Parents are supported to make meaningful links between the kindergarten and home learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree with ERO that:</p><ul>
<li>self review needs a stronger evaluative focus on how outcomes successfully impact on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Kindergarten Taranaki Key Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten Taranaki is a new entity established in March 2014. Collaboratively developed strategies and values guide future direction. An internal review of capacity and capability of non-teaching roles has been completed.&nbsp; Further development of processes and practices is required.</p><p>ERO, the chief executive and professional leaders agree that priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>developing the annual plan</li>
<li>strengthening systems and processes for performance management</li>
<li>consistent implementation of appraisal</li>
<li>reviewing and clarifying professional leaders&rsquo; role in building teachers&rsquo; capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eltham Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Eltham Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
