</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kereru Kindy Too is located in Whangarei. It is one of three centres owned and governed by Jenbryce Enterprises Limited. It provides education and care for children over two years of age and is licensed for up to 30 children.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review the centre has changed ownership and management. This is the first ERO report under the centre’s new management. The service was previously known as Koru Kids Preschool</p><p>The centre’s vision promotes a welcoming, learning focused environment. The philosophy is closely aligned to Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum, and focuses on children being competent and confident learners. Parent aspirations are recognised, and support a child’s learning and development. The commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is shown through a te ao Maori approach.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified the need for managers to improve management practices and clarify expectations of teacher practice. Centre leaders have responded positively to suggestions for ongoing improvement made in the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau are greeted warmly on their arrival into the centre, and children settle quickly. They play independently or join small groups, and enjoy long periods of sustained play. Children are supported by adults who are eager to engage with them and foster their sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers' talents and skills complement each other. Staff work collaboratively, communicate well and respond to children’s needs. They play with children, fostering their oral language and independence, and support children’s creativity. Learning provocations encourage children to inquire and develop their curiosity. Children’s opportunities to learn mathematics and literacy are evident. Children and teachers are confident using New Zealand sign language. An inclusive culture is promoted in the centre.</p><p>Children move freely between the two adjoining rooms. A range of natural resources are available. Good use is made of the small well-designed outdoor area to provide opportunities for explorations and investigation.</p><p>Respect for biculturalism is evident in the environment and centre practices. Kupu Māori is used in context with the children. Some teachers confidently take responsibility for integrating waiata, karakia, and te reo in the programme. These good role models are building the confidence and capability of all staff. The Maori perspective is integrated into programme planning.</p><p>Programme planning and assessment practices focus on children’s individual interests and prior learning. Parents’ aspirations inform planning which is updated regularly. Portfolios keep whānau informed of their child’s learning journey. Teachers make good use of programme evaluation to reflect on the impact of their teaching practice.</p><p>The use of internal evaluation has been effective in promoting change. There is a clear focus on ongoing improvement. Leaders and teachers continue to use internal evaluation to review the curriculum, and work towards promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Targeted professional learning has impacted positively on building teachers’ knowledge and capability. A mentor teacher supports the centre manager. Her influence is evident in the planning and practices that have been introduced into the centre. New team members have well informed induction. A new appraisal process is being developed. Using <em>Tātaiako, - Cultural competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners,</em> will deepen teachers’ reflection on the effectiveness of their practice.</p><p>The new owners have a clear vision for the centre. An appropriate governance and management structure is in place to support this vision. Comprehensive policies and procedures guide professional practice in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening programme evaluation by focusing more clearly on children’s learning outcomes </li>
<li>linking the principles of Tātaiako to the appraisal process</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kereru Kindy Too completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kereru Kindy Too will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>19 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
