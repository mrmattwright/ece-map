</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Elim Early Learning Centre Cambridge is located in Leamington, Cambridge and provides education and care for children from six months to school age. Elim ELC is governed by the Cambridge Elim Community Trust and is a not-for-profit organisation, seeking to provide positive outcomes for children in a Christian, values-based environment.  </p><p>The centre licence has recently been extended to cater for 60 children, including 20 aged under two. There is a small number of Māori children as well as children from a range of other ethnic backgrounds. Parents are able to choose flexible hours within a full-day session. They are warmly welcomed into the centre, and positive relationships are established among parents/whānau and teachers.</p><p>Children learn and play in two age-related rooms, and babies and toddlers benefit from key teachers who oversee their care and development. The centre's Christian philosophy informs practice, influences the programme, and provides the context for learning. Teachers believe in an holistic development approach that encompasses a balance of child-initiated and teacher-facilitated play.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been changes in centre management. A new business manager was appointed at the beginning of 2015 to grow the roll and strengthen aspects of governance including financial management. There have also been some changes to the teaching team and the employment of an ECE advisor.</p><p class="TableParagraph">The centre manager has reviewed and strengthened financial sustainability, implemented clear personnel management systems, and re-established a positive operating culture for staff. A newly formed leadership group is working collaboratively to respond to the recommendations of the 2013 ERO review that include:</p><ul>
<li>further building teacher capability in extending children's learning</li>
<li>implementing a staff appraisal process</li>
<li>strengthening parent partnerships</li>
<li>aligning strategic direction to all centre operations.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management are addressing these areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers establish welcoming, positive and respectful relationships with parents and whānau. They are committed to ensuring successful educational outcomes for children, and follow children's interests in a well-resourced environment. Teacher's practice is grounded in <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and they demonstrate quality practices in early childhood education.</p><p>Children are confident communicators and explorers within the centre environment. They share stories from home with their teachers who take an active interest in them and their whānau. Teachers have reviewed centre routines and practices in order to promote more flexible and responsive kai routines. They are now reviewing the layout of the indoor environment in the over two area to better support children's opportunities to engage in deeper learning and sustained play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive warm, responsive care from teachers who provide comfort and encouragement. They form strong attachments with their teachers through one-to-one caregiving relationships. Children are self directed and make independent choices in a calm environment appropriate to their needs. Teachers work collaboratively, and at meetings discuss and plan strategies that best respond to individual children and their families. They try to ensure that there is consistency in care routines between home and centre.</p><p>Teachers are strong advocates for children and their families and respond appropriately when there are behaviour and learning challenges. They have engaged in external professional development to learn about appropriate strategies to help children and their families overcome challenges. Teachers provide learning opportunities for older children that help them transition to school.</p><p>Assessment processes are well embedded and learning stories are now being made available to parents and whānau electronically. These learning stories, along with observations and teacher discussions, are used by teachers to plan for children's future learning.</p><p>Leadership roles and responsibilities are being reviewed following staff changes. The centre managers recognise the need to further build the professional capability of centre leaders. Self review has been strengthened as a way of bringing about improvement. An ECE advisor has worked with staff to enhance self-review processes.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are being increasingly embedded in centre practice. Te reo is evident in the centre environment and is used by teachers through instructions, waiata, karakia and conversations. Some teachers use te reo in the learning stories. They could now include children's own cultural identity and whakapapa as part of the learning portfolios. </p><p>The centre manager liaises between governance and management. He oversees financial planning and budgeting and, with the assistance of the administration manager, helps the trust board with decision making. A strategic plan, written by the centre manager, is to be approved by the board in April 2016 following parent consultation. Recent investment in professional development for teachers, and the establishment of a stronger senior leadership team, has encouraged and supported centre-wide professional growth. At the time of this ERO review the management team had:</p><ul>
<li>sought funding to refurbish the indoor and outdoor environments in the over-two area</li>
<li>begun to review centre policies and procedures</li>
<li>investigated information and models of best practice for teacher appraisal in line with Education Council requirements. </li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leadership team agree that key next steps for development include:</p><ul>
<li>consultation with parents/whānau, teacher and external expertise, to review the centre philosophy, in alignment with the values, vision and strategic direction, in order to establish shared understandings across the centre</li>
<li>continuing to build the professional capability of centre teachers and leaders</li>
<li>complete the review of policies and procedures</li>
<li>implement and embed a robust appraisal process for teachers and staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre manager and leaders complete an action plan to help guide the work in responding to the areas for review and development in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elim Early Learning Centre Cambridge completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Elim Early Learning Centre Cambridge will be in three years. </p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>8 April 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
