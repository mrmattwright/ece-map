</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rockmybaby Hawke's Bay 2 is a licensed all-day, home-based education and care service operating in Hawke's Bay. This is a quality funded network licensed for 80 children, including 80 aged up to two. Most of the 113 children enrolled are Pākehā and eight are Māori. This network comprises mainly educators who care for up to four children in their own homes. It also includes a small number of nannies who work in children's homes.</p><p>This privately owned network was established in May 2015 and is one of six North Island networks under the same Havelock North-based ownership. Three networks are located in Hawke's Bay.</p><p>The senior visiting teacher and three visiting teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. They provide support and guidance to educators and nannies about how best to provide responsive education and care to children.</p><p>The Rockmybaby philosophy is based on providing high quality education and care for children underpinned by the values of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, ūkaipōtanga and wairuatanga.</p><p>This is the first ERO evaluation of Rockmybaby Hawke's Bay 2 network.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy emphasis on the importance of collaborative relationships is highly evident. Positive, respectful and nurturing interactions between adults and children are a priority. A wide range of strategies encourages strong two-way communication and information sharing. Continuity of care and education for children is a priority and the service is highly responsive to the changing needs of families.</p><p>Children participate in a programme that is based on their interests, stages of development and inclusive practices. There is sustained focus on providing high quality learning experiences through ongoing curriculum developments. Families participate in highly useful workshops from external experts. Other practical information is shared to extend children's interests at home.</p><p>Termly planning themes provide a shared focus for providing breadth in learning opportunities. Recently improved planning processes incorporate the voices of children, whānau and educators. This is a useful platform to respond to family aspirations for their children.</p><p>A recent focus on creativity and exploration through play by teachers and educators has led to positive changes. Children learn in stimulating environments and engage with a wider variety of high interest resources. They benefit from participating in a wide range of activities in homes and experiences in the community, including weekly playgroup sessions.</p><p>A bicultural practice review undertaken by teachers identified they need to continue to lead work in this key aspect of the programme. They have begun professional development using the refreshed <em>Te Whāriki, </em>the early childhood curriculum. This should assist teachers and educators to build bicultural practices and provide a platform for how to promote success for Māori children as Māori.</p><p>Assessment for learning is actively promoted by visiting teachers' regular visits to the educators' home. Monthly reports affirm educators' efforts in noticing, recognising and responding to childrens' individual emerging interests. Each child's learning journey is an attractive record of their participation in the programme and revisiting learning is encouraged. The daily diary encourages ongoing sharing of infants' and toddlers' care routines.</p><p>Visiting teachers are well placed to identify emerging good assessment and planning processes for individual children. As a quality network, continuing to strengthen educator assessment practices and planning for individual children is an ongoing next step.</p><p>The teaching team model collaborative practices and build on individual strengths. The senior visiting teacher has a key role in monitoring and coordinating teachers' and educator practices. Teachers access and use professional learning and development and research. A sustained approach to enhancing educator practices is promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are encouraged to take on lead roles in developing areas of the curriculum and service operation. Recently developed resources enhance shared understandings of the Rockmybaby philosophy and its key role in shaping the service programme and emerging indicators of good practice.</p><p>Comprehensive home-based care and education systems and policies guide operations. Regular policy reviews are robust and make connections between areas. There is a clear focus on supporting children's wellbeing through sound systems. Health and safety in homes is well monitored through spot checks by visiting teachers.</p><p>Appraisal processes for teachers and educators are developing well. Whānau input into educator appraisal is valued and good practices affirmed. Strengthening teachers understandings of how best to set individual goals linked to outcomes for children should enable better alignment to the service philosophy.</p><p>The importance of using review and internal evaluation to inform ongoing improvements is well understood by the director and teaching team. Teachers are becoming better placed to use evidence to determine the impact of their actions on outcomes for children. The current focus on strengthening provisions for children under two years is informing the service philosophy and curriculum.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director and visiting teachers should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment and planning for individual children, including the bicultural aspect of the service curriculum</li>
<li>internal evaluation and the use of appraisal goal-setting to support growth in teacher and educator practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rockmybaby Hawke's Bay 2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>•       curriculum</p><p>•       premises and facilities</p><p>•       health and safety practices</p><p>•       governance, management and administration. </p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rockmybaby Hawke's Bay 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>30 January 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
