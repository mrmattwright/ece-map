</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St John the Evangelist Preschool is a Catholic community-based service for up to 35 children between two and five years of age. The centre is located next to a Catholic Church, a marae and school. The service is governed by a charitable trust.</p><p>The centre's philosophy values children's home cultures, Catholic values and the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>After ERO’s 2014 review, trustees continued to work with an external provider to strengthen governance and management practices. However, the centre’s contract with the external provider was terminated in November 2016 and a new centre manager was appointed in 2017.</p><p>With external support, progress was made in response to the recommendations of the 2014 ERO report. However, significant support is needed to help the new board and managers to develop a planned approach to improving the centre’s performance.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between teachers and children are positive. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging in the centre. Teachers provide good care for children and interact respectfully with them.</p><p>The programme does not provide sufficiently for the interests, strengths and abilities of individual children. The new centre manager recognises that planning and assessment should be developed to help teachers respond to children’s interests and learning in daily programmes. While teachers have attended professional development to help build their understanding of teaching and assessment practices there has been little improvement in their practice.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report recommended teachers focus on extending children’s learning through the appropriate provision of literacy and numeracy experiences. Teachers are still providing structured literacy and numeracy teaching that does not reflect children's current understandings or the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>At present the environment does not support children’s independent decision-making or provide learning challenges. Further review and development of the outdoor environments is planned to provide age-appropriate activities and challenges.</p><p>There is no clear link between the strategic plan and the actions of centre leaders. Strategic plans and policy frameworks need to reflect the Trust's intentions for the centre. Having effective planning and review systems would provide the manager with a good basis from which to promote more positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Internal evaluation systems do not result in improvements. Governance practices require significant improvement. Trustees need support to understand their roles and responsibilities and to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>policies and management systems are regularly reviewed and updated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal meets the requirements of the Education Council of NZ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional learning and development builds leadership and strengthens teacher practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St John The Evangelist Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>governance and management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum, teaching practices and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Education (ECE) Regulations 2008, 43(1a), 45a, 47(1a).</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of St John The Evangelist Preschool. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St John The Evangelist Preschool will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>7 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
