</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>TƒìnƒÅ koutou te kohungahunga o Te Mirumiru, arƒÅ ngƒÅ mƒÅtua, ngƒÅ kaiako, me ngƒÅ tamariki e mihi nei kia koutou e pou kaha ana kia whai ai te matauranga mo ≈ç koutou tamariki.</p><p>Te Mirumiru Early Childhood Education Centre opened in February 2012 and operates from a new purpose built facility on the grounds of the Ngati Hine Health Trust in Kawakawa. The centre offers bilingual education and caters for 100 children from birth to five years of age in age appropriate areas. The Kotare room caters for babies, the Tui room for toddlers, and the Pukeko and Kiwi rooms are for older children. Children of all ages share a large outdoor play environment. Most children and many kaiako (teachers) at the centre are MƒÅori.</p><p>The whakapapa of Ngati Hine is attractively reflected throughout the learning environment and in the naming of the centre. Art works and carvings from local MƒÅori artists line the entrance to children‚Äôs learning spaces and replicate important local landmarks. Kaiako frequently use te reo MƒÅori to support children‚Äôs learning. In each room there is at least one fluent speaker of te reo MƒÅori. All teachers are qualified.</p><p>Te Mirumiru is one of several services provided by Ngati Hine Health Trust. In line with the centre philosophy, children are supported to play and learn within a curriculum based on Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A core curriculum based on MƒÅori concepts and kaupapa provides the basis for all learning programmes. Kaiako are also developing and documenting ways to notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs individual interests. In some rooms, kaiako provide parents with daily information about their child‚Äôs learning, interests and development.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolios are attractive records of learning and provide useful information for parents. Parent contributions to their children‚Äôs learning stories are becoming increasingly evident. Teachers are also exploring how they might include bicultural approaches when documenting assessments.</p><p>Kaiako provide very good care and support for babies and toddlers and meet their need for strong and secure attachments. They effectively promote a calm, gentle and nurturing environment, and provide space and time for younger children to explore, play and learn. There are comfortable, safe spaces that cater for children who are not yet mobile and for those who are crawling and learning to walk.</p><p>Older children move freely around the centre and engage in simple play activities of their choice. They can often choose to play in other rooms. This choice helps with transitions into and through the centre and also promotes strong tuakana-teina relationships between younger and older children. Kaiako work alongside children and support them in their play.</p><p>Kaiako are developing their understanding of self review. Some documented processes are in place to guide teachers in looking closely at their practice. Kaiako meet regularly to discuss programme planning and children‚Äôs interests. They work well together and use each other‚Äôs strengths.</p><p>The centre manager is growing her leadership and provides good support for teachers. She is promoting the vision of Ngati Hine Health Trust for Te Mirumiru to contribute to its whƒÅnau ora approach. Tamariki, parents and whƒÅnau are supported to be confident and well informed. Managers are continuing to promote opportunities for parent partnership. Parents participate in monthly whƒÅnau hui and are currently working with centre staff to review and modify the centre‚Äôs philosophy.</p><p>Ngati Hine Health Trust provides good governance and management systems and support for the centre, including policy frameworks and guidance with health and safety provisions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that useful next steps for Te Mirumiru Early Childhood Education Centre include:</p><ul>
<li>documenting and regularly reviewing long-term strategic goals</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation approaches</li>
<li>further developing teaching practices that extend complex play opportunities, especially for older children</li>
<li>ensuring that teachers‚Äô appraisal includes attestation against the Registered Teachers Criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Mirumiru Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Mirumiru Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>28 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
