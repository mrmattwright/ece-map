<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Early Years Cornwall St is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Early Years Cornwall St is located in the Lower Hutt central business district. It caters for up to 100 children from birth to 5 years of age. Separate areas are designed specifically for the needs of different age groups.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by Kidicorp Ltd. Teaching philosophy, programme and practices are influenced by Reggio Emilia and Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE) educational approaches.</p><p>The professional services manager (PSM) and business manager (BM) visit regularly to provide coaching and mentoring as a means to monitor children&rsquo;s health and safety. Day-to-day management and responsibility for the programme is delegated to the centre manager and head teachers.</p><p>A connection with the Lower Hutt Returned Servicemen&rsquo;s Association (RSA) acknowledges the history of the site and the building occupied by the centre.</p><p>This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO review.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children, wh&#257;nau and aiga are warmly welcomed on arrival. A sense of belonging is promoted through responsive and respectful relationships. Parents are encouraged to stay and spend time with their children. Nurturing practices meet the needs of infants, toddlers and their parents.</p><p>The learning environment offers a wide range of activities that stimulate interest and encourage exploration. Teachers&rsquo; are positive and caring. They engage in conversation with children as they play and offer help and encouragement. Children freely choose their area of activity and play cooperatively for sustained periods. They are supported to develop independence through routines that are flexible and appropriate to the children&rsquo;s ages and stages of development.</p><p>Profiles are an attractive record of the children&rsquo;s learning at the centre. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to individuals' strengths and interests. A project approach enables children to investigate and experiment through play. Community expertise is used to extend children&rsquo;s learning in authentic contexts. A current focus on intentional teaching should further develop and strengthen teaching practice and consistency in capturing children&rsquo;s learning through learning stories.</p><p>Parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga&rsquo;s aspirations are sought and valued. They are encouraged and supported to contribute to their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Staff should continue to involve parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga and take account of their views in assessment and planning.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and share their knowledge, strengths and interests. Strong leadership by the centre manager promotes a culture of improvement through systematic self review. There is a high degree of commitment to bicultural practices. Links with Waiwhetu Marae are strengthening partnerships.</p><p>Staff should continue to develop their cultural knowledge and find ways to incorporate te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in the curriculum.</p><p>Children settle successfully into the centre and move between separate centre areas and on into school with ease. These transitions are supported by effective partnerships between families, the centre and schools. Parents are well informed about the choices available to them.</p><p>Sound professional leadership is provided by the PSM and BM. Regular meetings with the centre manager assists effective communication and practice aligned to the organisation&rsquo;s expectations. An induction and mentoring programme provides good support for provisionally registered teachers.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Cornwall St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>22 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
