<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</p>
<p>Children at Concord Kindergarten are very well cared for and enjoy interesting activities and experiences. The next step is for teachers to place an even stronger focus on how they support children&rsquo;s individual and group learning. When these things are more evident, teachers will be very well placed to promote and sustain positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Concord Kindergarten is a community-based kindergarten that offers a sessional and full-day programme for children from two to five years of age. It is one of 22 kindergartens under the Dunedin Kindergarten (DK) organisation. Over the last three years there have been some changes in staffing. The inside area has been recently renovated to create a better learning environment.</p>
<p>Teachers prioritise working closely with families, building children&rsquo;s sense of belonging to the kindergarten and encouraging children to understand the importance of sustainability of the environment. The kindergarten grounds are often used by the local community.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Dunedin Kindergartens (DK) umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Concord Kindergarten has a welcoming culture. Children settle quickly on arrival and they confidently approach their teachers. Parents and wider family often stay and involve themselves in the programme, activities and events. They feel comfortable to talk about and share their cultures. For example, parents have cooked and shared food from their homeland, and shared stories, songs and dances.</p>
<p>Teachers have created an environment that is very calm. They are positive, responsive and caring in the way they relate to the children. Overall, teachers know the children well, their interests and their lives outside the kindergarten.</p>
<p>ERO noted other aspects of the kindergarten that are going well. In particular, children benefit from:</p>
<ul><li>a wide range of interesting learning experiences, such as excursions, visitors and cultural events</li>
<li>a strong focus on M&#257;ori culture</li>
<li>a well-resourced indoor and outdoor environment</li>
<li>very good use of digital and print media to share children&rsquo;s experiences and learning at the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have made a special area for parents to relax in. In this area parents and children enjoy reading and viewing what children have been doing at the kindergarten.</p>
<p>The head teacher and new team work well together and have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The two senior teachers from DK provide useful support and guidance for teachers. Effective systems are in place to ensure that the children are safe and healthy. The DK managers and governors have a clear strategic direction and a sound policy framework to support the kindergarten and how it provides for children.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>ERO found that teachers could improve their understanding of effective self review. For example, they need to: narrow the scope of some reviews, ask more evaluative questions, use indicators of best practice, and analyse their findings before making changes.</p>
<p>Some aspects of group and individual planning for children&rsquo;s learning could be improved. Plans need a stronger emphasis on learning, including more detail as to how teachers will support the learning. More-specific plans will help teachers to evaluate better how well they have supported children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Given the changes in the teaching team, it would be timely to review the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and review how teachers support children&rsquo;s oral language and social development.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Concord Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. Click here to enter text.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
