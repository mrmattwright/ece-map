</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaiti Kindergarten is adjacent to Te Kura o Kaiti in Gisborne. It opens from 8:30 to 2:30 Monday to Thursday and 8.30am - 12.45pm on Friday. The service is licensed for up to 40 children aged from two to school age. At the time of this ERO review, 35 children are enrolled, 31 of whom identify as MƒÅori and three of Tongan heritage.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on providing rich learning opportunities where culture, language and identity are valued. Children, whƒÅnau and teachers work collaboratively to foster a learning environment where inclusive practice promotes an holistic view of the child.</p><p>Since the June 2014 ERO review a new head teacher and teaching team have been appointed. All teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher, who supports the teaching team.</p><p>Over the past three years staff have participated in professional learning provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) which has included Te Ao MƒÅori, working with younger children and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Kaiti kindergarten is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the association. Two senior teachers provide ongoing professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed term contract to guide kindergartens' implementation of tikanga and kaupapa MƒÅori practices.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development, at kindergarten level, including; literacy and numeracy opportunities, self review and assessment, planning and evaluation. Good progress has been made in these areas. At association level ERO identified that strategic self review and review the implementation of the appraisal process was needed. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in their learning through a strong bicultural curriculum. Teachers work closely alongside individuals and groups, supporting their learning. Interactions are respectful, responsive and fun. There is clear focus on building social competence and oral language. Children have opportunities to explore, experiment and investigate. Their culture, identity, and language are evident and celebrated.</p><p>The centre is currently undertaking a review of its philosophy. It is timely for leaders and teaches to consider ways they can consult with parents, whƒÅnau and families, to determine what their valued outcomes are for children. In addition, developing clear indicators of good practice should further support the effective implementation of the philosophy.</p><p>Kaupapa MƒÅori practices are well integrated into the programme. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori in meaningful conversations with tamariki. Tikanga practices are highly valued and well understood by children. Waiata MƒÅori helps to extend learning.</p><p>The kindergarten continues to explore ways to enrich the place-based curriculum by promoting local te ao MƒÅori places that are unique to Kaiti. Leaders and teachers identify that visiting these places through regular excursions, to add authentic meaning for children's learning, is a key next step. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop their understanding of what Pacific success looks like. They use parent expertise to extend the programme. Specific professional learning and development is used to build teachers' knowledge of what educational success looks like for their Pacific community.</p><p>Responsive and respectful learning partnerships are established with the community. Teachers provide opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau as valued partners, to contribute to their child‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers have developed meaningful strategies to support children with additional learning needs. External agencies are accessed when required.</p><p>The kindergarten has a well-considered approach for children's transitions. Teachers identify any potential gaps that may impact on this process. They have recently established a relationship with a local school to develop transition expectations.</p><p>Planning for learning is based on children‚Äôs individual needs and interests. WhƒÅnau and parent aspirations are captured soon after enrolment. Teachers and whƒÅnau work in partnership to develop specific learning goals. Teachers are beginning to use a Kaupapa Maori framework for assessment, planning and evaluation that is aligned to the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children's learning portfolios show their participation in the programme, developing friendships and progress towards their identified learning goals. Leaders should consider ways they can clearly identify what the relevant learning is for children. This should assist teachers to show how they provide challenge and complexity to extend children's learning.</p><p>Internal evaluation for improvement is developing. Teachers continue to build their evaluative knowledge and capability through specific professional learning and development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are committed to establishing a share vision for the kindergarten. They are beginning to build collaborative ways of working together. Teachers are reflective and improvement focused.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to develop their practice. There is a strong commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system should strengthen teachers' inquiries into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty-based partnerships and acknowledging MƒÅori as tangata whenua. The association has identified that developing shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consult with their community and develop good practice indicators for their philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend the place-based curriculum through regular excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the new appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels of the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaiti Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaiti Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>9 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
