</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Lou‚ÄôOlive Preschool provides education and care for up to 25 children up to five years of age. Children up to two years of age are cared for in a separate room environment and have opportunities to integrate with the older children for specific activities. This full day service has a history of good ERO reports. Managers have responded well to the suggestions for improvement in ERO‚Äôs 2011 report.</p><p>Akoteu Lou‚ÄôOlive delivers programmes in the Tongan language, culture and identity and Christian values. It is situated on the property of the Free Church of Tonga and is one of two licensed centres. It is governed by parent, teacher and church representatives who form the management committee. The service is led by early childhood trained centre managers who work closely with the management committee. Leadership roles and responsibilities within the service are clearly identified.</p><p>Managers support teachers to gain registration as teachers. There is a focus on promoting and supporting younger teachers to gain qualifications to ensure the sustainability of the service and implement the akoteu‚Äôs philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and relate well to each other at the akoteu. Children‚Äôs strong sense of Tongan identity and belonging is well supported by the teachers. They connect culturally with each other, their teachers and their learning environment. They actively participate in the programme and are free to explore independently. Children make choices about their play from a variety of resources that support mathematics and literacy learning and reflect the Tongan culture. Teachers provide some opportunities for children to develop independence and to take responsibility for their own learning.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to participate in and contribute their ideas to support their children‚Äôs learning. Active participation in parent teacher meetings enables teachers and parents to develop better understanding of the value of early childhood education. Teachers cater for parents who are fluent in the Tongan language as well as those who are learners of the language. Teachers use a variety of methods to communicate with families about the service and the learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers are improving how well they assess and plan for children‚Äôs learning. They notice and respond to children‚Äôs individual interests and record their findings in attractive, individual assessment portfolios. They discuss and plan collectively for individual and group learning, incorporating children‚Äôs prior knowledge.</p><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, guides the programme. Teachers are developing a better understanding of the ways that children learn and are working more closely with parents to support children‚Äôs progress. Learning is celebrated through ceremonies that include parents, whƒÅnau and the extended community.</p><p>Teachers are gradually building their professional skills. They are becoming more confident in using self-review processes and understand how review helps them to make steady improvement to their practice. Staff are supported to build their professional knowledge through internal discussions and by attending workshops. They agree that they now need to review the quality of the play environment and their effectiveness in providing experiences in all of the play areas.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs culturally responsive programme recognises the place of tangata whenua. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are being promoted through the bicultural curriculum. Children enjoy waiata, karakia, and welcoming visitors to their centre.</p><p>The management committee consists of church, parent and staff representatives. They use their personal knowledge and professional expertise to provide direction and good governance for the centre. The committee is well established and is recognised in the community. Members work collaboratively with the centre manager to ensure teachers provide a good quality programme for children. Active and responsive leadership is demonstrated through regular monthly meetings and clear documentation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers acknowledge that, to continue improving outcomes for children, they need to strengthen their use of self review and:</p><ul>
<li>develop a strategic plan that is clearly linked to the annual plan and that documents the centre‚Äôs priorities and associated goals for achieving its vision</li>
<li>extend the quality of children‚Äôs learning as they prepare to transition to school</li>
<li>strengthen children‚Äôs learning opportunities and independence in both the indoor and outdoor environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Lou'Olive Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Lou'Olive Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
