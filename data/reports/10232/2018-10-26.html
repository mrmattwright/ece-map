</table><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of the learning programme, improvement and consistency in teaching, sustainable and effective governance and quality internal evaluation.</p><p>The Poetiare Malo Amata Trust, has taken over the governance and management of the centre following the resignation of the previous long-serving licensee and centre manager. The 2015 ERO report identified that improvements were needed in the areas of teaching and management. These have not been addressed. A new centre manager and head teacher have been appointed to develop and implement an action plan for the centre.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Poetiare o Rongomai is licensed to provide full-day care and education for up to 27 children between two and six years of age. The centre operates from a building with a large outdoor play area set within the grounds of Rongomai Primary School. The centre has easy access to the school's playing fields, garden and bush areas.</p><p>The Cook Island language and culture form the basis of the philosophy and teaching practices that are strongly influenced by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles. Most children enrolled are of Cook Island heritage. Four staff members are native speakers. Parents and trust members provide extra support for the Cook Island language to children and ƒÅnau who attend this service.</p><p>The Poetiare Malo Amata Trust represents the Cook Island Community and is committed to the maintenance of the Cook Island language and culture. Trustees are responding to the dilemma of losing a language nest and the opportunity to enrich their akapapa'anga in their language and customs.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships are evident between teachers, children and families. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and are proud of the focus on Cook Island culture. Staff recognise the importance of continuing to provide opportunities to support the culture, language and identity of all children.</p><p>Centre staff are committed to developing strong relationships with parents, whƒÅnau and the local community. They regularly communicate with parents about the learning programmes and centre operations. Parents are invited to contribute to the centre at all levels of operation.</p><p>A strategic plan and policy framework has been adapted for the centre. Leaders continue to review these documents to guide and improve the effectiveness of centre-wide practices to promote positive learning outcomes for children. However, there are several areas that need to be urgently addressed. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation, and responsiveness to children's interests, strengths and abilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying expectations for teachers to record the assessment of children's learning in portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaders building professional capability and teaching practice through critical reflection and ongoing internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing children's access to a wide range of challenging and natural learning resources for their creative and explorative play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using the resources and spaces to support children‚Äôs independent decision-making and extending the learning challenges for older children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have participated in Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) and other professional development. The learning from this professional development has not improved teacher practice. Leaders recognise that assessment and planning should respond to children‚Äôs interests and learning in the daily programme. However, this is not evident in centre documentation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders are currently rebuilding staff capacity and consistency in teaching practice. Centre leaders agree that the priorities for the centre's development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that the curriculum supports children's competence and confidence through increased child-led, play-based learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide children with an effective range of experiences to enhance their learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support teachers to develop teaching practices that facilitate more sustained and complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make greater use of outcomes from internal evaluation and appraisal to improve the quality of teaching and learning practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a review cycle for policies and procedures that includes monitoring their alignment with the centre philosophy and practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Poetiare O Rongomai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the managers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>risk analysis and management processes and practices for excursions are robust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hazards in the environment are promptly identified and minimised or removed.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified several areas of non-compliance relating curriculum, management and governance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building teachers' understanding and use of the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and their knowledge of relevant theories and practices in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including personnel management, annual planning, and internal evaluation.<br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: C2, C4, GMA 6-8; Vulnerable Children's Act 2014.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. ERO will monitor this plan.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Poetiare O Rongomai will be within two years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>26 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
