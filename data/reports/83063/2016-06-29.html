</table><p>Barnardos Kidstart Childcare-Oamaru Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre is part of Barnardos Kidstart, a nation-wide charitable trust that specialises in educational programmes, care and support for children and their families. As such, the centre receives a range of professional leadership support from Barnardos that is focused on continuing to improve outcomes for all children.</p><p>Care and education programmes for children from birth to school age are provided in two separate areas. Programmes are based on Te WhƒÅriki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Planning is currently underway to update the outdoors environment.</p><p>Staff are a mix of fully registered teachers, new graduates and teachers in training. Since the 2013 ERO review, cultural diversity has continued to increase. Daily meals for children are prepared by an experienced cook. The centre actively promotes healthy food and physical activity.</p><p>Progress has been made in addressing the areas identified for improvement in the 2013 ERO report. Good progress is evident in some areas while others continue to be a focus for ongoing attention.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the nurturing care and support they receive from teachers who know them and their families well. The frequent links teachers make between the centre and home help to build relationships that are warm and responsive to the needs of children and their parents. Children‚Äôs wellbeing remains a key and shared priority for all staff. Centre leaders seek extra support for children who have particular learning, social or health needs.</p><p>Children are encouraged to choose learning activities that are of interest to them and are supported to become increasingly independent. They have ongoing opportunities for settled and sustained play. Teachers‚Äô constant conversations with children and open-ended questioning support oral language development and help to build children‚Äôs confidence in expressing ideas. Children learn ways of playing with their peers and resolving conflict through the ways teachers model and reinforce positive choices and behaviours.</p><p>Centre leaders and staff actively value children‚Äôs diverse cultures and languages. They think deeply about cultural values and ideas. This is strengthening aspects of the programmes and practices for MƒÅori and Pacific learners. Centre leaders and teachers welcome parents into the centre. They seek and respond to parents‚Äô feedback and work closely with them to support children.</p><p>Some well planned, large-group programmes are in place. The best examples of these make the intended learning clear and identify the strategies teachers will use to support this learning. Improvements to the way group programmes are evaluated will considerably strengthen current practice.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the under two‚Äôs area are well nurtured and cared for. Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs verbal and non-verbal cues and encourage gradual independence. Routines for young children are flexible and responsive to their needs. Early literacy is promoted through music and movement.</p><p>Staff are well supported by their professional and early learning managers. Useful Barnardos systems and structures support internal evaluation and health and safety practices. Appraisal processes promote teacher reflection, especially in regard to professional readings and their links to teaching practice. The professional learning programme is well linked to centre goals and other practices and systems that promote children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. Recently a developed guidelines and templates to further strengthen internal evaluation have the potential to considerably improve outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree on the following priorities for improvement. These are:</p><ul>
<li>further strengthening internal evaluation</li>
<li>continuing to improve assessment and planning processes and practices for individual children</li>
<li>formalising, documenting and using observations of teaching practice in appraisal processes.</li>
</ul><p>Once the current review of the centre‚Äôs philosophy has been completed, it would be timely to evaluate progress in other areas against the updated philosophy‚Äôs aspirations and goals. Focus areas could include the indoors environment and centre programmes such as readiness for school and support for children with English language needs.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Kidstart Childcare-Oamaru Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>29 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
