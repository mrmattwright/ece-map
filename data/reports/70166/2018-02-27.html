</table><p>Fernside Preschool Limited is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fernside Preschool Limited is a family-owned, semi-rural service that provides education and care for children from 3 months to school age. Most teachers are qualified and certified in early childhood education. One of the owners is also the centre manager. The co-owners and head teachers make up the centre management team.</p><p>The service is part of the Puketeraki KƒÅhui Ako|Community of Learning.</p><p>The centre management team and staff have addressed all the areas for improvement outlined in the 2014 ERO report. Leaders and teachers have ensured that changes to the mat time are now more beneficial to children's learning and interactions. The centre owners have extended the non- contact time for head teachers to enable them to carry out their leadership responsibilities more efficiently. The centre management team has clearly outlined how it will work with the staff to achieve the centre's long-term goals.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience welcoming, positive and caring interactions. They are actively involved in a calm, unhurried learning environment. Teachers support children well to be confident communicators. One-to-one and responsive interactions are highly evident to support the security, wellbeing and development of infant children.</p><p>Children confidently choose from a range of stimulating and challenging activities. They have time to develop their problem solving skills and learn from observing others. They have good opportunities to experience their natural, spacious outdoor environment and key places in the wider community.</p><p>Teachers prepare a thoughtfully-planned environment to carefully build children's confidence and independence. They have a strong sense of collective responsibility for children's wellbeing, learning and physical development. Children have appropriate levels of challenge to support this. The programme also provides opportunities for older children to play and learn with younger children.</p><p>Teachers confidently use te reo MƒÅori throughout the day. They plan different experiences to build children's respect and awareness of their own and others' home cultural backgrounds. This culturally-responsive approach further develops individual children's confidence and feeling of inclusion.</p><p>Children with additional needs are also well supported.</p><p>Teachers proactively use professional development to extend their practice and improve outcomes for children. They collaboratively plan activities to meet children's needs and interests particularly when learning as part of a group. They effectively use internal evaluation to identify strengths and what needs to be improved and promptly act on findings.</p><p>Leaders and teachers provide a range of ways, including the use of technology, to effectively aid communication between home and centre. Parents are regularly invited to contribute ideas and feedback to enhance assessment and planning practices. Teachers appropriately respond to this feedback. Children enjoy the comments their parents make in their learning stories.</p><p>The centre management team has effectively established a number of useful operational systems, processes and procedures. Their internal evaluation is meaningful and well focused on outcomes for children and their progress over time. They are currently updating key policies and procedures. This includes the child protection policy and the appraisal process. These policies and processes have yet to be implemented and embedded in centre practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and ERO agree, that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen planning and increase the consistency of practice across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complete, implement and embed the updated appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fernside Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels, police vetting, teacher registration and ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fernside Preschool Limitedwill be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>27 February 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
