</table><p>Centre members have established cooperative, positive and inclusive relationships amongst adults and children that contribute to a settled environment. They would now benefit from stronger support from the Counties Playcentre Association (CPA) to further build their capability to plan and implement a programme that is responsive to the needs of older children. In addition members require further support to ensure that association expectations and regulatory requirements, particularly for health and safety, are consistently met and sustained.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tuakau Playcentre is a long-established, parent-cooperative early childhood education service. It is situated near the centre of Tuakau township and offers sessions for up to 30 children from birth to school age, five mornings a week. These sessions are planned and overseen by two employed supervisors who take responsibility for different sessions. Through the centre's philosophy, parent members aim to provide a quality early childhood learning environment, incorporating a cooperative family/whānau experience.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 centres in the Counties Playcentre Association (CPA). The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the CPA provide governance oversight for the centre. This includes strategic direction, management support, documentation and adult education programmes. In addition, the centre receives regular visits from association personnel whose role is to provide advice, guidance and support to centre members. The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently undergoing restructuring, and this has implications for CPA governance actions in the future.</p><p>In response to recommendations in the 2013 ERO report, CPA and centre leaders developed an action plan for increasing numbers of parents participating in playcentre training, improving transitions to school, and strategic planning. This plan has provided the centre with a clear strategic approach to centre development and improvement. Since then members have made some progress with increasing participation in parent education and improving transitions to school. There continues to be an urgent need for the association to provide effective support for this centre during a time of centre development, with a particular focus on meeting regulatory requirements.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentres in the Counties Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and adults participate together in a well-balanced programme that features both child-initiated and adult-led activities. All children enjoy making choices from a wide range of equipment and materials in 16 areas of play. Literacy learning is well supported by experiences that integrate opportunities for children to write and draw in the context of play, an appropriate range of books, and opportunities to share well-known songs and stories. The strengths of this observed programme are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>opportunities for children to sustain their play through flexible routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creativity linked to children’s interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's confidence to express their ideas and opinions to interested adults</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children developing their leadership, social skills and friendships in a mixed-age setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents contributing their knowledge and interests to enrich the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Members would benefit from making use of Ministry of Education resources and exemplars to support their developing understanding of planning processes, practices and bicultural assessment.</p><p>Older children are confident to take leadership roles, engage in complex dramatic play with their peers and make meaningful contributions. There is a need to plan for further experiences that provide challenge and add complexity to play for children as they near school age.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from a whānau-based centre where mothers can maintain home routines for care, including quiet times for breastfeeding. They enjoy a recently developed, well-designed and attractive area that responds to their specific needs. Children are active explorers, well-included alongside their older siblings and peers. Babies and toddlers are treated with respect and kindness by adults and children. The indoor and outdoor environments provide them with appropriate challenge and interest. Positive interactions and flexible routines are contributing to a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging for children and adults.</p><p>Māori children and whānau participate in an early childhood service that values a shared leadership approach and a cooperative learning environment. There are some members who model the use of te reo Māori n meaningful ways. Adults have developed and displayed a pepeha for each child. There are resources and activities that promote respect for te ao Māori, Papatūānuku and sustainability. While the CPA has an appropriate Treaty of Waitangi policy, their bicultural advisory committee is not currently functioning.</p><p>Members have established a respectful, inclusive and welcoming culture for children and their families/whānau. They provide continuity of experiences as children transition between their homes and the centre. Adults know children well and support them to maintain their language, culture and identity while at the centre. Families bring a range of useful experiences and knowledge to contribute to the programme. Members work as a collaborative team, and many commit to attending playcentre training. These aspects have supported members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meet a number of the intended goals of the action plan leading to centre improvement and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain positive links with the wider community, including the nearby school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustain the service with a consistent roll.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre leadership has been through a time of change. Members are supported to respond to the intent of the philosophy by an enthusiastic centre president and other experienced leaders. They have worked well to develop and foster emergent leadership through positive role modelling and ongoing support. This positive approach to developing leadership is resulting in increased participation in playcentre training and a cooperative contribution from members to day-to-day organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As identified in the 2013 ERO report, the association needs to provide more effective support for quality assurance, self review, planning and assessment.</p><p>Important next steps for ongoing development are the implementation of systems and processes for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>effective self review leading to centre improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quality assurance, including health and safety practices that meet regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continued improvement with assessment and planning practices that respond to children's strengths and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revitalised centre support in the area of bicultural practice, including researching and integrating the history of local hapū and iwi into the programme through meaningful experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>ERO further recommends that CPA:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continues to access support for Tuakau Playcentre for professional learning and development that focuses on strengthening self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develops strategies to ensure that its centre members are kept up-to-date with obligations and expectations in relation to current regulatory requirements and policies.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tuakau Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop, document and implement an annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure daily hazards are identified and made safe: cover electric sockets accessible to children, ensure chemicals and harmful substances are not accessible to children, prevent children's unsupervised access to the adult toilet area, secure out-of-sight areas that are not supervised by an adult at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>secure heavy objects that might fall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hold and document regular earthquake drills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a system of regular appraisal for paid employees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>police vet for anyone appointed to work during normal opening hours.</p>
</li>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
