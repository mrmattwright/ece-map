<p>6 March 2012</p>
<h4>To the Parents and Community of Petone Beach Kindergarten</h4>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Petone Beach Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Petone Beach Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>Children benefit from a programme that is responsive to their strengths and interests and allows for good continuity with learning at home. The kindergarten provides a relaxed, happy and inclusive environment where children are engaged in activities of choice for sustained periods in small groups or individually. Dramatic role play and musical experiences feature throughout the day. There is also good provision for a range of physical challenges. Teachers regularly offer experiences that invite and encourage children to extend their knowledge and capabilities. Children confidently show initiative and take up leadership opportunities.</p>
<p>Teachers are calm and respond to children with warmth and affection. They promote positive social behaviour, problem solving and perseverance. The teaching team demonstrates a sustained commitment to integrating te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the programme. Children are confident and capable in te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and kapa haka. They are learning to value and respect the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>There has been continual upgrading of the environment and resources to support children&rsquo;s learning. This has resulted in improved flow between the indoors and outside, increased sheltered areas and created a more spacious work and play space. Self review is used effectively to improve outcomes for children.</p>
<p>The teaching team agrees that areas for further development include the environment and aspects of assessment.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h4>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h4>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically.&nbsp; However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO Corporate Office in Wellington.&nbsp; Please consult your telephone book, or see the ERO web page, http://www.ero.govt.nz, for ERO office addresses.</p>

<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Petone Beach Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Petone Beach Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h4>The Quality of Education</h4>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The 2008 ERO review noted that children were developing as confident, competent learners and were engaged in purposeful play for sustained periods. Assessment, planning and evaluation had improved as a result of professional development and were positively impacting on the programme. Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and group planning stories required further development. The report recommended staff undertake professional development to support their understanding and the implementation of self review.</p>
<p>In 2009 the kindergarten, in response to its community&rsquo;s needs, diversified its operations. It now operates sessions closely aligned to school hours three days a week and for the mornings on the other two days. The number of teachers has also increased, resulting in improved teacher/child ratios.</p>
<p>In 2011 the kindergarten has been part of the association YMen initiative to enable children to experience the positive influence of a young male involved as part of the regular team.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Bicultural practice</p>
<p>The teaching team demonstrates a sustained commitment to integrating te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. This underpins the philosophy, programme and practices and is central to teachers&rsquo; beliefs. They take responsibility for continuing to increase their own knowledge and skills and for implementing these. M&#257;ori values and concepts are interwoven throughout the programme and in documentation. Children are confident and capable in te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and kapa haka. They are learning to value and respect the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>Programme</p>
<p>Teachers&rsquo; shared beliefs about how young children learn are clearly articulated and evident in practice. The teaching philosophy provides a sound base for the programme. The variety of equipment, resources and interesting materials provides a wide range of opportunities for physical, imaginative and exploratory play. Daily team discussions increase responsiveness to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Teachers offer experiences that invite and encourage children to extend their knowledge and capabilities.</p>
<p>The planned programme evolves from what teachers notice children are interested in and successfully promotes values inherent in the philosophy. It is effectively aligned to Te Wh&#257;riki and makes clear links and provides continuity with learning at home. The ongoing development of the programme is well documented and displayed.</p>
<p>Portfolios effectively capture individual children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Entries are creatively written, well analysed and include relevant next learning steps. Teachers are implementing strategies to strengthen partnership with families.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>Continual upgrading of the environment and resources supports children&rsquo;s learning. Alterations to the building have resulted in improved flow between the indoors and outside, increased sheltered areas and created a more spacious work and play space.</p>
<p>Interactions</p>
<p>Children play in a relaxed, happy and inclusive environment. They work together for sustained periods and are able to negotiate the roles and direction of play. At times they are also highly focused in individual self-chosen activities. Children confidently take the opportunities for showing initiative and leadership.</p>
<p>Teachers are calm and respond to children with warmth and affection. They promote positive social behaviour, problem solving and perseverance. Teachers&rsquo; involvement supports the sustained flow of play according to children&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>Self review</p>
<p>The teaching team is developing a good understanding of planned self review. They follow a sound process that incorporates the identification of quality indicators, analysed data including contributions from families, and action plans. There is regular reflection on progress.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>The continuity of children&rsquo;s individual learning is not always evident. Portfolio entries do not always show the implementation of identified next steps or make links between entries to show increasing complexity and progress over time.</p>
<p>Self review</p>
<p>Teachers acknowledge their next step in self review is to evaluate the impact on children&rsquo;s learning of any changes. Gathering a wider range of data to inform decision making would support this.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>Teachers should consider ways to enhance the learning environment through:</p>
<ul><li>maximising opportunities for authentic early literacy and mathematical experiences</li>
<li>including a stronger reflection of the diverse cultural community</li>
<li>minimising background noises, especially when everyone is inside.</li>
</ul><h4>Association Support</h4>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten environment is positive, welcoming and inclusive. Carefully considered transition processes are in place and are flexible to accommodate differing family needs. Teachers know children and their families well. Kindergarten documentation shows that children with special needs are included naturally and positively in the programme and environment.</p>
<p>The association&rsquo;s mission is to provide quality, inclusive and accessible early childhood education. Being inclusive and partnership with parents, wh&#257;nau and community are stated as core values and principles.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Petone Beach Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the kindergarten leaders agreed that the priorities for development and review are those outlined in the report.</p>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
