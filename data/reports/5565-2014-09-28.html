</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Birdwood Kindergarten in Ranui, West Auckland, provides early childhood education for up to 30 children from two years to five years of age. Families have the option of enrolling children for six hour days, or for three hour morning or afternoon sessions. Children of mixed ages, including siblings and children from extended whƒÅnau, attend sessions together.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides management and curriculum support for teachers.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs vision aims to promote a strong sense of belonging, collaboration and sharing relationships between tamariki (children), whƒÅnau, ngƒÅ kaiako (teachers), and the community. Bicultural practices based on Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles of participation, protection, and partnership and related concepts are being further strengthened and implemented into the programme. Kindergarten teachers and staff are inclusive and supportive of tamariki and whƒÅnau from varied ethnic backgrounds and family circumstances.</p><p>Birdwood Kindergarten has been responsive to the areas for development noted in the April 2011 ERO report. Staff are continuing to develop a programme that focuses on extending children‚Äôs emerging interests.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten provides a supportive and welcoming learning environment. Children show a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. They engage in the programme and enjoy exploring the environment. Staff support children to develop social skills and competency in the English language. Younger children are now attending and this is resulting in tuakana /teina relationships, where older children are developing leadership roles to support younger children.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report there have been improvements to facilities and practices that include:</p><ul>
<li>The kindergarten building has been upgraded. This improvement has helped teachers to provide a more purposeful learning environment that engages children‚Äôs curiosity and exploration and is affirming of whƒÅnau cultures.</li>
<li>Planning now includes whƒÅnau aspirations and has a stronger emphasis on supporting the learning of the individual child.</li>
<li>Technology is being used more to strengthen learning opportunities for children.</li>
<li>Appraisal systems have been further improved to challenge and strengthen teacher knowledge and raise the quality of practice.</li>
<li>The development and consolidation of self review systems and procedures that are impacting positively on children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, provides the foundation for the learning programme. The concept of ako/shared learning, that recognises how children, parents and teachers can learn from each other, underpins learning practice.</p><p>Positive relationships based on whanaungatanga/a sense of meaningful connectedness are increasingly evident, and parents are beginning to participate more in the programme. The head teacher leads an inclusive teaching team approach where teachers and support staff share ideas, decision making and other responsibilities. Teacher trainees are welcomed and respected for their contributions to the programme.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association has well established systems for self review and accountability to guide kindergarten management, and it continues to provide effective governance for kindergartens. The AKA has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to implementing strategies that support kindergartens in promoting positive outcomes for all children. Birdwood Kindergarten has a clear framework of strategic goals, which closely link to those of the AKA. This framework guides the vision and annual planning for the kindergarten, and is reflected in teachers‚Äô appraisal goals. The AKA is currently reviewing the appraisal process for all kindergartens.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that key next steps for the kindergarten include teachers continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>help children extend their own learning</li>
<li>develop understandings with parents about how they can work together to further support children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>use self review to improve the quality of practices across all areas of operation.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Birdwood Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Birdwood Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
