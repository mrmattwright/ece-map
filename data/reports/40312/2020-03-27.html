</table><p>Waiapu Kids - Merivale Whanau Aroha¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiapu Kids ‚Äì Merivale Whanau Aroha is located in Parkvale, Tauranga. The building is owned, and was purpose built by the Ministry of Education and situated on the grounds of Merivale Primary School to meet the needs of the community. The centre is governed by Waiapu Anglican Social Services Trust Board. It provides all day education and care for children from school age to birth in a mixed-age setting. The centre is licensed for 43 children including 10 up to two years. The current number of children enrolled is 44, almost all children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The governance board is responsible for strategic direction, policy and human resourcing. The centre manager is responsible for day-to-day running of the centre, and reports to a general manager employed by Anglican Care Waiapu.</p><p>The philosophy of Waiapu Kids - Merivale Whanau Aroha aims to provide a safe and inclusive environment that fosters competent and capable children who have a desire for knowledge and lifelong learning. Encompassing the spirit of the child while walking alongside the community, strengthens connectedness and relationships contributing to successful outcomes for all. A genuine commitment to te ao MƒÅori is woven throughout the service. The centre ethos is underpinned by Christian values.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em> and has been localised to include four ‚ÄòPriorities of Learning‚Äô developed in consultation with the community. These include: <span lang="mi">Turanangawaewae,</span> Social Competence, Transitions and Nature-based Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a highly inclusive learning environment that promotes equity for all. Local stories, places of significance and relationships with community groups are a significant part of the curriculum. This affirms the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori. Real-life experiences such as gardening, harvesting, cooking and interacting with the natural environment as <span lang="mi">kaitiaki,</span> provide children with meaningful and authentic opportunities for learning. The comprehensive local curriculum reflects teachers, whƒÅnau and wider community priorities for children's learning.</p><p>Children are viewed as capable and competent. They experience an environment that fosters their resilience, social and emotional competence, and self-belief. Teachers actively promote children's oral language development through thoughtful questioning and conversation. Children's independence and self-management skills are deliberately fostered by teachers. The whƒÅnau-like setting values <span lang="mi">tuakana-teina</span> relationships.</p><p>Highly effective, trusting relationships among teachers, whƒÅnau and children promote the mana of the child within the family. Warm and affirming interactions underpinned by highly effective communication allows teachers to work in partnership with whƒÅnau. The centre effectively networks with the local school, church and external agencies to holistically support the child and their family. Transitions into the centre and on to school, are flexible and responsive to individual needs.</p><p>Parents have many opportunities to be involved in and contribute to their child‚Äôs learning journey. Digital portfolios reflect children‚Äôs interests, strengths and engagement in a variety of learning experiences.</p><p>Leaders are strongly focused on providing equitable opportunities to support participation and educational success for all. The recently reviewed philosophy, developed in consultation with whƒÅnau, underpins centre operations. A coherent approach to supporting quality teaching is focussed on continual strengthening of individualised assessment, planning and evaluation. Highly-reflective practice and a focus on improvement is guided by effective internal evaluation. Leaders work with educational community networks to access appropriate expertise and resourcing. There is a high-level commitment to honouring <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> practices.</p><p>Comprehensive systems guide centre operations. The general manager receives regular and detailed reporting from management. A Christian ethos with a strong focus on equity underpins decision making. The recently reviewed strategic plan informed by the centre community, provides clear direction and is strongly linked to positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the centre are to further strengthen individualised learning pathways that reflect:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>agreed priorities for children's learning as documented in the local curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>language, culture and identity of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiapu Kids - Merivale Whanau Aroha completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the implementation and recording of lockdown drills on at least a three-monthly basis.</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
