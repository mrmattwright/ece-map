<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Sydenham Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Sydenham Community Preschool&rsquo;s premises were significantly damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. The preschool was in temporary premises at a local church hall. In 2013 the centre moved to a purpose-built centre on the grounds of Waltham School. Most of the centre&rsquo;s teachers are qualified in early childhood education or in training to become qualified. Since the August 2009 ERO review, the centre has changed its management structure. The parent management committee members are undertaking training to better define their roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>During the review children displayed confidence in making their own choices from the activities offered to them. They were involved with the activities for sustained periods of time. Babies and toddlers were regularly included in the programme for the older children. They were made to feel welcome by the other children and the teachers. They showed that they were confident and capable in this environment.</p><p>Teachers interact positively with the children. They demonstrate an understanding of, and are respectful of, children&rsquo;s preferences, interests and routines. Teachers make learning fun.</p><p>At group times the teachers provided children with many opportunities to learn and use te reo M&#257;ori in a way that was meaningful to them.</p><p>Teachers are actively involved in promoting positive relationships within the centre. Children play well together and the programme provides opportunities for frequent interactions between siblings and other family members. Parents are warmly welcomed in to the centre and they regularly contribute to the programme, the management of the centre and to the development of the physical environment.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They share useful information through regular team discussions. Leadership roles are now shared amongst the teaching team, making better use of individual teacher strengths. As a team the teachers are reflective and focussed on continuous improvement to enhance outcomes for children. They regularly seek professional development to support them in their roles and aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operation.</p><p>Teachers and the parent committee have been appropriately focused on setting up the new centre. They have worked collaboratively with other agencies to develop a new centre. Despite uncertainties about centre premises, they made sure the centre families were able to continue to participate in early childhood education. Teachers put effective plans in place for maintaining children&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing when working in temporary premises. Significant work and planning by the teachers and management committee has contributed to the successful development of their new centre.</p><p>At the new centre:</p><ul>
<li>staff make good use of regular conversations with each other to talk about how the programme can best meet children&rsquo;s needs</li>
<li>children are provided with a good range of interesting activities</li>
<li>staff are developing a new environment that provides many opportunities for children to explore and use natural materials as part of their play.</li>
</ul><p>Key Next Steps</p><p>Now that the significant work required in setting up the new centre is complete, the management committee, staff and ERO agree their next key steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop programme planning and assessment</li>
<li>successfully complete the current review of the staff appraisal system</li>
<li>strengthen teachers' self-review practices, including more focus on what they want the outcomes for children to be</li>
<li>develop an annual plan that clearly guides the centre&rsquo;s future direction and self review</li>
<li>strengthen the management committee members' understanding and use of self review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sydenham Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>9 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
