</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waihi Kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy is underpinned by the values of tuakiri (identity), ngakau tapatahi (integrity), maia (courage), houtupu (authenticity), takaro (playfully), and arohanui (compassion). The vision aspires to ‚Äògift each child with the skills, knowledge, attitude and confidence - with the support of parents and whƒÅnau - to choose their own path in life‚Äô. Strong reciprocal relationships with children, their whƒÅnau and families encourages active engagement across all areas of Waihi Kindergarten, nurturing a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior Teachers oversee and support the professional work of kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a Resource Teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities, education for sustainability, meeting community needs, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There are systematic processes and highly effective self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of teaching, education and care provided by this kindergarten.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review a head teacher and new teachers have been the appointed. The head teacher has led an effective transition of change across all aspects of the kindergarten. The contribution of funds from the local business community has enabled the kindergarten to upgrade the environment to enhance learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The areas identified for development in the 2013 ERO report have been effectively addressed. These include the strategic and annual plan reflecting the aspirations of the community, and the implementation of a very effective emergent curriculum.</p><p>Waihi Kindergarten operates six hour daily sessions from Monday to Friday. The current roll of 38 children includes seven who are of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The head teacher‚Äôs passion and commitment to the vision of ‚Äòrealising the positive potential in all children‚Äô is well supported by a very effective and experienced teaching team. She leads by setting clear expectations for teaching staff, recognising individual strengths and expertise. The senior teacher works collaboratively with the head teacher to develop a culture of continual growth. This is built on a solid foundation of relational trust and the provision of effective mentoring and professional support.</p><p>Whanaungatanga is integral to all aspects of the kindergarten respecting the funds of knowledge of children and whƒÅnau. A key characteristic of this kindergarten is accepting, acknowledging and valuing people for who they are and what they bring. Men are highly visible and present in the centre. They feel welcome, involved and empowered to work and play alongside their children. This provides positive male role models for all children as well as valuing the male perspective on learning. Children, parents and whƒÅnau have a strong sense of ownership and are actively involved in all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Self review is robust, includes the voices of parents and children, and uses current research to inform teaching and learning. Parents are engaged and provided with opportunities to review and participate in programmes that inform them about transition from kindergarten to school.</p><p>The environment invites children‚Äôs ‚Äòurge to play‚Äô through thoughtful provocation that enables children to lead their own learning. Children identify their interests, plan and develop their own areas of inquiry, and access the resources to engage in sustained play. A wide range of physical challenge is available to children, contributing to their child‚Äôs confidence and competence as successful learners.</p><p>The teaching team is an effective facilitator of learning for children and whƒÅnau. Teachers utilise a wide range of teaching strategies that enhances teaching and learning outcomes. They provide opportunities and encourage children to express their points of view and be involved in decisions that affect them.</p><p>Teachers provide authentic opportunities for complex learning to occur across all curriculum levels. Science concepts, early literacy and mathematics, and the exploration of the natural world are integrated through meaningful play. Teachers actively integrate te ao MƒÅori perspectives as an integral part of the programme with a specific focus on sustainability ‚Äì partnership, protection and participation. The kindergarten ngahere is seen as a taonga for children to develop a sense of kaitiaki (guardianship and nurturing) of the environment. MƒÅori children are affirmed as MƒÅori because their language, identity and culture is highly valued.</p><p>Children‚Äôs social and emotional wellbeing is paramount and qualities of self-management and independence are fostered. Effective strategies are utilised to enhance children‚Äôs understanding of responsibility, consequences, and the influence on others and the environment. Risk taking is seen as a learning opportunity which empowers children to problem-solve and develop resilience and resourcefulness. The teaching team has identified and ERO agrees that the next step is to further develop an assessment framework that reflects the culture and uniqueness of Waihi Kindergarten.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waihi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waihi Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>27 January 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand.
