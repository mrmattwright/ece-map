</table><p>Redwoodtown Kindergarten is <em>Well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Redwoodtown Kindergarten is one of seven kindergartens administered by Marlborough Kindergarten Association. A general manager oversees the association under the governance of an active, supportive and future-focused board.</p><p>The general manager is responsible for the operation of the kindergartens. A senior teacher provides advice and guidance for teachers on the curriculum, teaching practices and the running of the kindergarten. The head teacher manages the day to day operation of the kindergarten. All teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten has developed positive and respectful links with its multicultural community. It has a well organised and spacious indoor and outdoor area for children to build on play and follow their interests.</p><p>The association and teachers have responded positively to the recommendations in the March 2011 ERO report. This includes strengthening children‚Äôs assessments, self review and programme evaluation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Marlborough Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The well-considered child centred philosophy is embedded into daily practices and children‚Äôs programmes of learning. It appropriately reflects the values and aspirations of their children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children learn and socialise in a collaborative and interesting programme. Their interactions are supported by teachers and other children. Children are carefully guided to make positive personal choices. They show a good sense of belonging in a child-focused learning environment.</p><p>Assessments show a wide range of learning experiences. They frequently identify children‚Äôs interest, participation and value children‚Äôs home culture. Many assessments are beginning to identify children‚Äôs developing interests and show links to previous learning.</p><p>The experienced teaching team, in an informal and spontaneous manner, give emphasis to literacy and numeracy in ways that engage children in meaningful learning. There is a good balance between teacher initiated and child-led activities.</p><p>Teachers frequently participate with children in play and involve them in purposeful conversation s. They provide a wide variety of learning resources, including well laid out gardens, for children to explore and challenge their thinking. Teachers work well together and are led by an experienced head teacher.</p><p>Parents are provided with useful assistance to help with transition. Close links with local schools benefits children and their parents in a well-planned and purposeful transition into, within, and onto school.</p><p>The Association‚Äôs specialist teacher provides targeted support for individual children and works with teachers to help with strategies for particular individual and groups of children.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association provides high levels of direction and support for managers and teachers. Managers ensure that teachers have access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>A recent review of biculturalism across the Association has identified that teachers have an understanding of bicultural practices and are in the early stages of increasing the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. They have used their recent professional development to include a greater focus of local MƒÅori culture within the programme.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report, the managers have undertaken a thorough review of self-review practices. They have identified that this is an ongoing area to continue to develop. Teachers‚Äô understanding of self review is increasing. The useful and recently introduced self review format is helping teachers focus on how they can improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Association‚Äôs long term plan gives clear direction and identifies specific priorities that are focused on improvement. Redwoodtown Kindergarten‚Äôs annual plan closely links with the Association‚Äôs long term plan. However, parts of this plan could be more specific and include detailed short and long term goals.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association has a comprehensive policy and procedure framework in place to provide clear expectations for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and senior teacher have identified and ERO agree that assessment of children‚Äôs learning needs to be strengthened. Teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly identify the learning that is happening for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the ways they can include parent and child views about learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently identify the role of the teacher and what they will do to support children‚Äôs future learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers also need to more clearly document and show how children‚Äôs emerging interests are being met.</p><p>The Association is currently reviewing the existing appraisal process. Managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the appraisal process needs to be further extended. This should include more robust and formal feedback for teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Redwoodtown Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Redwoodtown Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
