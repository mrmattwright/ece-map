</table><p>Stepping Stones Daycare Ltd¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stepping Stones Daycare Ltd in Mt Eden is licensed for 35 children, including eight up to the age of two years. The centre operates in a renovated purpose-built building and serves a culturally diverse local community.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO review, the centre has new owners. Four of the five teachers in the long-serving teaching team are qualified teachers. The newly appointed supervisor oversees curriculum management and mentors teachers. The owner/director has a range of skills that support the service's strategic direction, whƒÅnau and various community groups. The director provides daily operational and management support.</p><p>The service is founded on a philosophy that promotes aroha and fostering children's love of learning. It has a commitment to building strong relationships with children, teachers and whƒÅnau, based on love and respect.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. The 2016 ERO report highlighted many positive practices and support for children's learning. The key next steps related to internal evaluation, recognising children's cultures and involving whƒÅnau. These have been addressed satisfactorily.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers take the time to greet children and their whƒÅnau when they arrive. At this time whƒÅnau and teachers exchange information about the child's wellbeing and stories that link home and the centre programmes. As a result, children settle quickly into the centre. They are confident and competent and have a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children experience a programme and routines that reflect their individual preferences and interests. Teachers set up activities to encourage children to engage in play. Children choose what they want to play with, enjoy imaginative play and explore happily alongside each other. They often sustain their play for long periods with their peers, adults or by themselves. Literacy, maths, science, and technology concepts are intentionally woven into the play programme. Children‚Äôs work is displayed attractively around the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a separate indoor play area. They benefit from good periods of uninterrupted play and choose independently from accessible resources. Teachers promote an inclusive environment. They follow children's cues and have a responsive care approach to teaching.</p><p>Some aspects of tikanga MƒÅori are evident. Teachers are committed to extending their knowledge of te ao MƒÅori. They should now increase their use of te reo MƒÅori and strengthen bicultural practices in the programme.</p><p>Teachers' and children's cultures, home languages and life experiences enrich the programme. Teachers use children‚Äôs first language in the context of their play. WhƒÅnau enjoy and contribute to cultural events and festivals celebrated in the centre.</p><p>It is timely for leaders and teachers to evaluate the quality of the resources and equipment in the centre. Increasing children‚Äôs access to a greater variety of open-ended resources would more effectively support and enhance their learning and development. Teachers could also increase resources that reflect community diversity.</p><p>Teachers support children and their whƒÅnau well as they transition into and through the centre. They should now evaluate the effectiveness of the transition to school programme and the broader curriculum, to ensure they align well with the expectations of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em></p><p>Teachers‚Äô respectful relationships with children and their whƒÅnau are a strength. Teachers are further developing ways that could build on more whƒÅnau engagement and contribution to the centre‚Äôs programme.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolios are a record of their participation in the programme, and their learning progress and development over time. These records include parents' contributions and focus on children's individual interests, strengths and abilities.</p><p>Leaders are developing an organisational culture that supports ongoing improvement. They are future focused and promote collaborative and distributive approaches to leadership. Leaders should strengthen strategic planning to support the service's new direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for managers and teachers include accessing external professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extend teachers' professional knowledge, practices and skills to improve the quality of teaching and learning for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation to ensure a strong focus on improving all aspects of centre operations and outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement an appraisal process that is aligned to Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen strategic planning by developing clear goals that link with an annual action plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stepping Stones Daycare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>15 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
