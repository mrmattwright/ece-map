<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Overall, the centre is well placed to provide good quality learning and care for its children. This is a direct result of recent external support and professional development, the new leadership, and the strong commitment from the teaching team.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>This is a small community-owned centre that is governed by a parent committee. Parents are often in the centre and support the centre in many ways. Teachers know their children and families well. As a result, the centre has a family-like feeling.</p><p>Teachers provide education and care for children from birth-to-school age. Each teacher is assigned a small number of children so that she can establish a special relationship with the child and family. Children learn and play in a mixed-age setting, often with siblings.</p><p>Since 2012, there have been significant changes in staffing and in the management committee. The new head teacher and committee members have benefitted from useful and ongoing external professional support. This has led to many improvements. The centre is well led and managed by a new head teacher.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing the 2009 ERO recommendation to improve the quality of planning for individual children. The recommendations to improve the quality of self review and strengthen the M&#257;ori dimension in children&rsquo;s learning continue to be a focus.</p><p>Building plans have been approved to extend the centre.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The children quickly settle on arrival, confidently approach their teachers and make good use of the centre resources. ERO observed fun and laughter as the teachers worked and played with the children. Teachers make good use of &lsquo;teachable moments&rsquo; to enrich children&rsquo;s vocabulary, and extend their thinking and knowledge. They involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play but also know when it is best to leave them to play and investigate independently.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for with affection, warmth and respect. Their oral language and physical development are very well supported. Older children play well alongside them and consider their needs.</p><p>Teachers have significantly improved the quality of their assessment and planning for individual children. ERO saw many examples where progress in children&rsquo;s learning over time is clearly evident.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to children with special needs. For example, they use specialist advice and plan specific strategies to help the child experience success.</p><p>Teachers show skill in how they support children&rsquo;s language development. They listen carefully to children and hold sustained conversations with them. They explicitly model desired spoken language. Teachers often use books, song and role play well to enrich the children&rsquo;s literacy and social learning. They introduce children to written language in imaginative ways.</p><p>The centre philosophy refers to promoting children&rsquo;s confidence, creativity, exploration, and social skills. ERO found that the children enjoy a variety of interesting planned and spontaneous learning experiences that reflect these priorities.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard to provide an indoor environment and resources that provoke children&rsquo;s curiosity and build on their interests. As a result, children chose to play for sustained periods of time on particular activities. In the large outdoor area, they choose many opportunities to enjoy physical challenges in a natural setting.</p><p>Teachers communicate well with each other about children&rsquo;s care needs and learning. They also take time to talk with parents about their children&rsquo;s wellbeing, learning and involvement in the programme.</p><p>The parent committee meets regularly and is well informed about centre operations. It has developed a useful strategic plan to guide the centre&rsquo;s work over the next few years. Other parents generously give their time to help on subcommittees, such as fundraising and building developments.</p><p>The new head teacher has a very good understanding of best practice in early childhood education. She is being well supported in her new leadership role.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Aspects of management could improve. The parent committee needs to develop an annual plan that builds on its strategic plan. This should clearly show what will happen each year, how, when, and who will be responsible. This plan may be a useful tool for helping the committee and staff to be focused in their work. It may also be a useful tool for reviewing progress.</p><p>The parent committee would benefit from increasing its understanding and use of self review. For example, it needs to regularly survey for staff and parent satisfaction, and review its own governance practices. Presently there are no guidelines or policy for self review. The centre&rsquo;s self-review schedule does not cover all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operations.</p><p>Teachers need to continue to strengthen their understanding and use of effective self review. Reviews should be more evaluative and have a stronger focus on teaching and learning. When leaders appraise teachers, they need to show that teachers are appraised against all aspects of the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Major progress has been made with assessment and planning. The next steps for teachers are to better record and evaluate the strategies they use to add value to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Teachers have identified that they need to continue to strengthen the use of te reo M&#257;ori and learning about M&#257;ori culture. ERO believes that there could be a greater focus on children&rsquo;s cultural identity (M&#257;ori and other) in their records.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Alexandra Childcare Centre (1995) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
