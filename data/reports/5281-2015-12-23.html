</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wycliffe Nga Tamariki Kindergarten is located in Onekawa, Napier and provides education and care for up to 41 children over the age of two years. It is open five days a week from 8.45 am to 2.45 pm, and caters for 31 children. Of these, 20 are Māori. Full day sessions are attended by older children while morning sessions include those who are younger.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operation of 16 kindergartens including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association and support for the general manager. Two education managers are responsible for building teacher capability. The head teacher provides professional leadership to the team of teachers. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa Mātauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. He demonstrates a clear vision for Māori children and their whānau.</p><p>Whanaungatanga is at the heart of the centre philosophy. Positive relationships with children, whānau and community affirm culture, language and identity. These are central to the learning environment. The kindergarten kaiawhina role is well established.</p><p>Since ERO’s October 2012 report many of the identified positive areas of good practice have been sustained. The centre has made progress in responding to the recommended next steps.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergarten reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage positively in a curriculum that reflects the kindergarten philosophy. They actively participate in learning experiences designed to promote growth. Opportunities to lead and selfdirect their own learning are provided. Children are involved in a gymnastics programme that builds capability and offers challenge and complexity. Literacy and mathematics continue to be significant elements of the programme. Children have opportunities to become confident explorers, scientists and leaders who draw from the wide range of experiences to develop and extend their ideas and abilities.</p><p>Children’s wellbeing is affirmed through teacher responsiveness to individual needs, interests and strengths. There is a calm and settled tone. Children requiring additional guidance and support are assisted by teachers and external agencies.</p><p>The curriculum focus of development is highlighted through assessment and planning. Literacy, numeracy, gymnastics and te ao Māori are visible through a range of individual and group learning stories. Portfolios are attractive records of rich learning experiences. Records show children’s learning outcomes, interests over time and strengths.</p><p>Bicultural practice is progressing as teachers continue to increase their knowledge and understanding of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Kaiawhina contribution to te reo me ngā tikanga Māori is appropriately modelled and has provided significant learning and support for tamariki and kaiako.</p><p>Parent, whānau and community voice is valued. Kanohi ki te kanohi kitea is the preferred mode of communication. A strong relationship with the local marae has been established. Processes to support kindergarten and school transitions are considered.</p><p>The head teacher encourages and supports teachers to take on leadership responsibilities. A collective team approach is enacted. Individual strengths contribute to an effective collaborative approach.</p><p>Teachers have increased their knowledge and understanding of self review. Improvement-focused reflection is guiding changes in practice. Further development of some aspects of self review and evaluation is a next step.</p><p>The association empowers teachers to use the team’s strengths to respond to children and the parent community. Education managers should continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes to effectively build teacher capability. These include self review, assessment, planning, internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten teachers and association managers should:</p><ul>
<li>further embed and extend the scope of self review and evaluation for continuous improvement</li>
<li>improve appraisal goal setting, evidence, observations, feedback and next steps.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wycliffe Ngā Tamariki Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wycliffe Ngā Tamariki Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
