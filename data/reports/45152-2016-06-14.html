</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years Petone (previously known as Early Years Nevis Street) operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>Full and part time care and education is provided for 97 children including 25 up to two years of age. Twenty five children enrolled identify as MƒÅori. A new leadership team has formed since the 2012 ERO review. Distributed leadership is practiced. A centre manager has overall responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included strengthening teachers' understanding of project-based learning and primary caregiving for infants and toddlers, assessment, planning and evaluation, self review and the integration of te reo MƒÅori. Progress in these areas has been made.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four in BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children access a learning environment that encourages exploration. They work collaboratively with their peers engaging in sustained play. Independence skills are promoted. Teachers know children well within the context of their families and draw on this information to engage with them. Leaders have indicated that there is a centre-wide focus on using intentional teaching strategies to respond to all opportunities to challenge children's learning.</p><p>There are comfortable, safe spaces available for children who are not yet mobile. Teachers are warm, responsive and promote respectful practice. Descriptive language is used to support and extend children's developing vocabulary. An unhurried and calm environment is evident. Children with additional learning needs are identified, supported and monitored by teachers. Where appropriate, the centre coordinates with external agencies.</p><p>Teachers have further developed their knowledge of the bicultural curriculum through the recent initiative to establish a wharenui in the centre. Research has been undertaken and contact made with local experts to support this development. Leaders have identified that a next step is to consider how they nurture, use and honour this taonga, as well as continuing to develop teacher's bicultural practice.</p><p>Leaders have identified that developing teacher's knowledge of promoting educational success for MƒÅori children is a key next step. Leaders and teachers should strengthen their understanding of Ministry of Education documents to guide this practice. These resources include <em>TatƒÅiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> and <em>Ka Hikitia- Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em>.</p><p>Culturally significant events are celebrated in the centre. Families participate in these and share their expertise. Thoughtful consideration has been given to reflecting the cultural backgrounds of children and their whƒÅnau through the environment.</p><p>Children's first language is valued and promoted. Where teachers can, they speak the home language of the family. This supports the child's successful transition into the centre. Leaders have indicated that a next step is to further develop their knowledge to promote success for Pacific children.</p><p>Profiles show children's participation in the programme and their developing relationships, and identify children's ongoing interests. This assessment information should be strengthened through documentation that shows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>how parent's aspirations are used to inform the child's programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly, children's progression in learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's cultural identity being acknowledge and celebrated.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The curriculum emphasises healthy eating and promoting physical activity. Children contribute to the development of a planned group programme that is responsive to their interests. This emphasis provides a shared direction for the learning experiences offered. Next steps are to include a focus on identifying the specific teaching strategies used and to evaluate the programme overall.</p><p>Self review supports ongoing improvements and is guided effectively by the BestStart process. Leaders have identified that refining the scope of the review is an area for improvement. Developing teacher's knowledge and practice of internal evaluation is a key next step.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process which has a developmental focus. Leaders have indicated that a next step is to include formal observations of all teachers' practice to inform judgements about the quality of practice. BestStart provides opportunities for teachers to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>BestStart, as a governing body regularly undertakes parent satisfaction surveys which are used to further develop practice. Most parents involved in these surveys indicate a high degree of satisfaction with teacher practice and the curriculum provided. Leaders have been highly responsive in progressing ongoing improvements.</p><p>Professional Service Managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum. They clearly identify strengths and areas for ongoing development through this process.</p><p>Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A comprehensive policy framework including procedures and systems, guide the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>having a stronger focus on the use of intentional teaching strategies through practice and the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop the bicultural emphasis in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teachers' knowledge of promoting educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further improving the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teachers and leaders capability in internal evaluation and strengthening appraisal through the inclusion of observations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Petone completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>BestStart is currently working with the building owners to fully comply with the requirement for a building warrant of fitness.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years Petone will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
