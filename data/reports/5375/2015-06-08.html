</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parsons Avenue Kindergarten is located in Levin next to Levin East School. Since the May 2012 ERO review, significant redevelopment of the outdoors has occurred to provide children with inviting learning space. Of the total roll of 62 children, 21 are M&#257;ori. The recently reviewed kindergarten philosophy includes shared beliefs that support children to become confident and competent life-long learners.</p><p>Parsons Avenue Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Wh&#257;nau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te&nbsp;Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children's learning.</p><p>All teachers at Parsons Avenue Kindergarten are qualified and registered. The experienced head teacher has been at the kindergarten for many years. Several staffing changes have occurred since the previous ERO report. The kindergarten currently has five permanent fulltime teachers.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Parsons Avenue Kindergarten identified that review of routines and planned self review of curriculum effectiveness required further development. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergarten&rsquo;s annual plans with the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 reviews in the He Wh&#257;nau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum, environment and resources provide children with a varied range of activities and learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers generally have positive and responsive relationships with children and actively promote peer interactions. There is a clear focus on ensuring teaching practice and the environment is supportive and inclusive. Teachers share values that encourage respectful behaviour and support children's developing social competencies.</p><p>Young children and toddlers welcome opportunities to enthusiastically explore, talk about and engage in these experiences. Literacy and mathematical learning feature meaningfully within a variety of experiences throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers use assessment to increasingly respond to children's immediate and emerging strengths, interests and skills. Narratives and photographs show their engagement and progress. These observations of learning are reflected in portfolios and a variety of visual displays within the centre. Teachers&rsquo; analysis of observations continues to be refined and developed.</p><p>Parents are welcomed and acknowledged as their child&rsquo;s first teacher. Partnerships are based on acceptance and respect. Teachers encourage and provide opportunities for parents to contribute to their child&rsquo;s learning. The diverse backgrounds of children and their families are valued.</p><p>Teachers effectively support children to settle into kindergarten. Transitions to and from the kindergarten are flexible and responsive to individual needs and preferences. Positive, reciprocal relationships with the adjacent school help to support children and families with transitions.</p><p>The experienced head teacher provides effective leadership. Self-review processes continue to develop practice through a focus on teaching and learning. A range of perspectives and information is gathered. Children&rsquo;s ideas are considered. Teachers should now deepen the analysis of the information gathered to further improve educational outcomes for children.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. These continue to require development. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Children at Parsons Avenue Kindergarten have frequent opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage. Association leaders acknowledge that they need to build teachers&rsquo; capability to be responsive to M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>T&#257;taiako:&nbsp;Cultural Competencies for Teachers of M&#257;ori Learners</em>.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, teachers, and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Parsons Avenue Kindergarten:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening and further developing self review and evaluation understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to refine and develop aspects of assessment and programme planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investigating further ways to promote te ao M&#257;ori in a more local, &lsquo;place-based&rsquo; context.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He Wh&#257;nau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teachers&rsquo; capability to be more responsive to M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s culture, language and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Parsons Avenue Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Parsons Avenue Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>8 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
