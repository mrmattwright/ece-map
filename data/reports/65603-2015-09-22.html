</tr></tbody></table><p>Westport Early Learning Centre is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Westport Early Learning Centre is a community-based, not-for-profit centre, run by a board of staff and parents. The purpose-built centre, with extensive outside play areas, is located near a sporting facility enabling additional activities for children. There is a welcoming environment where children‚Äôs families and cultural backgrounds are valued.</p>
<p>The centre is licensed as a full-day service for up to 50 children with up to 12 places for under two year olds.</p>
<p>Since the 2012 ERO report, the centre has made good progress with self review, aspects of assessment and has strengthened the strategic plan to focus more on teaching and learning.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Leaders and teachers are developing useful self-review processes. While in the early stages of implementation, this new process has begun to improve learning outcomes for children. A recent review of the centre‚Äôs philosophy included perspectives from the board, staff, parents and children. The philosophy‚Äôs focus on building positive relationships, use of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the New¬†Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, and bicultural practices are evident in the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers actively support children‚Äôs learning through play. They provide a wide-range of learning opportunities in response to children‚Äôs interests and to encourage further curiosity. Children remain engaged in self-selected activities for long periods of time. Relationships between teachers and children are positive.</p>
<p>Teachers capably notice children‚Äôs interests, and recognise their learning over time in attractively presented profile books. These books provide parents with a record of their child‚Äôs involvement in the learning programme. Learning stories show the connections between the home and the centre with parent comment regularly included. Children‚Äôs home culture is well recognised.</p>
<p>Strong features of the curriculum that impact positively on children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing include:</p>
<ul><li>an appropriate emphasis on literacy, mathematics and aspects of science</li>
<li>enhancement of children‚Äôs physical and social development through sport and fitness activities</li>
<li>routines that are flexible and responsive to children‚Äôs needs</li>
<li>authentic opportunities for children to take leadership roles in caring for the environment and leading the group at mat times.</li>
</ul><p>Children are supported to learn in expansive well-presented indoor and outdoor learning environments. Provisions within these spaces enable a good range of choice and challenge for children to build their confidence and independence.</p>
<p>Children who are MƒÅori have good opportunities to succeed as MƒÅori. A teacher with specialist knowledge and skill in te ao MƒÅori actively promotes the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori across the centre and throughout the programme. Children who show particular interest, or who are transitioning onto bilingual schooling, receive additional support. The learning environment reflects aspects of bicultural New Zealand.</p>
<p>Teachers use effective strategies to help children settle into the centre. A nurturing environment provides infants and toddlers with a sense of wellbeing and belonging. A well-considered and planned process is in place to support transition within the centre. Teachers are also responsive in the way they assist children, and their family, in preparation for school.</p>
<p>Teachers involvement in professional development has helped them to look more closely at their practice, question how best to support learning outcomes for children and increased the level of professional discussion. It has led to changes in the programme and the recognition of the need for well-understood systems and processes within the centre.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that priority should now be given to implementing more consistent and robust appraisal processes, including supporting policies and procedures. Involvement of the board in helping to set the centre manager's appraisal goals, in line with the centre's strategic plan, will strengthen the forward direction of the centre.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of board governance could be further improved by:</p>
<ul><li>clarifying and documenting the roles and responsibilities of trustees</li>
<li>increasing involvement in setting strategic direction for the centre</li>
<li>board members being more actively engaged in policy development and review.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders recognise there are improvements needed in planning and assessment for groups and individual children. They have begun to review current practices. ERO agrees this is an important area for development. Ensuring policies and procedures for planning and assessment are collaboratively developed and documented will further support shared understanding, teachers‚Äô ongoing practice and centre self review.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Westport Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Westport Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
