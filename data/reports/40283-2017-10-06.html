</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Monokia is a mixed age-based education and care service in Rotorua. It is licensed for 50 children including 10 up to two years of age. The centre operates an all-day service, under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Ltd, which provides overall strategic direction and comprehensive systems to guide and manage centre operations. The current roll of 57 children, includes 28 MƒÅori, and small numbers of Cook Island, Filipino, Indian and Cambodian children.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is focused on promoting relationships that enable 'tamariki to reach their full potential in a safe, secure environment'. Open lines of communication with whƒÅnau are promoted, and kaiako understand that for tamariki to grow and develop, a sense of belonging must be created. The teaching team is dedicated to providing an environment that reflects the diverse learning community and their needs.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2014, there have been some staffing changes including the appointment of a new centre manager in June 2017. The centre manager is being supported by the business and professional services managers.</p><p>Since 2014, the centre staff have undertaken professional development and workshops to strengthen the links between programme planning, assessment and evaluation, and bicultural and multicultural aspects of the programme. The staff are continuing to develop their understanding and knowledge in these areas. More recently changes have been made to the large indoor/outdoor area, as well as a special water play feature being added outside.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum is providing a variety of opportunities for children to engage in sustained learning. Teachers identify children‚Äôs interests and learning to plan learning experiences that they discuss at weekly staff meetings. They respond to many parent aspirations and reflect on the value of the opportunities provided. Children experience excursions within the local community, alongside parents and whƒÅnau. The centre curriculum is supporting children‚Äôs confidence and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers promote confidence in children through respectful interactions and affirmation of learning. They closely observe children and engage them in conversations about their play and ideas. Some teachers are responding well to children‚Äôs interests and plan deliberate strategies to enhance their learning. Parents and whƒÅnau enjoy respectful and regular communication with staff about their child‚Äôs learning and progress. There remains a need for greater consistency in teaching practice, including strengthening links to the intentional weekly plan.</p><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of assessment for promoting positive learning outcomes. They have also undertaken professional development in curriculum planning and assessment. Children‚Äôs learning is recorded in portfolios and shared with whƒÅnau electronically. The portfolios are readily accessible to children for revisiting their learning. Teachers need to continue to strengthen assessment practices to support children‚Äôs continuity in learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well catered for in the centre‚Äôs mixed-age setting. Teachers' interactions with young children are respectful and unhurried. Positive relationships among children are evident. The extensive learning environment includes a special area with a dedicated quiet space for infants where their wellbeing needs are met.</p><p>Teachers are starting to work together to identify children with identified additional needs. These children are well cared for, supported and monitored, in partnership with parent and whƒÅnau aspirations. There remains a need for leaders and teachers to develop a collective understanding of how they identify the diverse priority groups attending the centre and to develop contextualised learning experiences.</p><p>Bicultural practices are in early stages of development in centre life. A comprehensive review of bicultural experiences has been undertaken by teachers. As a result, teachers are taking increasing responsibility to further their knowledge and understanding of bicultural practices and language. There is more work to do to integrate MƒÅori language and culture more spontaneously in daily programmes and environment. Strengthening and embedding bicultural practices and use of resources is needed to give all children a better understanding of New Zealand‚Äôs cultural heritage.</p><p>Leaders are committed to realising the vision, goals and philosophy of the centre. The new centre manager is demonstrating sound knowledge about teaching and learning, and is modelling good practices to staff. She is developing positive working relationships with teachers and open communication with children, parents and whƒÅnau. Professional learning and development for all staff is well supported by BestStart professional practice leaders. Relationship building and collaborative ways of working are strengthening learning partnerships with all participants at the centre.</p><p>Internal evaluation requires strengthening to be more robust and focus clearly on learning and teaching. While teaching staff are engaged in a variety of regular internal evaluation processes and practices, these could be further strengthened by linking more directly to teaching practises and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers need to continue building learning and teaching practices focusing on the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>support for priority learners</li>
<li>learning partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau</li>
<li>bicultural practices</li>
<li>staff appraisal processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Monokia completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Monokia will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>6 October 2017</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
