</table><p>Mangere East Family Service Centre requires support to improve management practices, internal evaluation and documentation, and to help teachers develop responsive curriculum planning and implementation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Mangere East Family Service Centre is a non-profit incorporated society. The organisation has recently rebranded and operates as ME Family Services (MEFS). The early childhood centre operates as a core service of the MEFS, which is adjacent to the Mangere East School. It caters for a culturally diverse community. Māori children make up 44 percent of the centre's roll, 24 percent are Tongan and 30 percent have other Pacific backgrounds.</p><p>The service was established in consultation with the community in 1993. It provides assistance to whānau, including parenting programmes, child health and education services, social workers in schools, and waste minimisation/resource recovery programmes. The centre is governed by a board. It is managed by the CEO of the MEFS, the social work manager, the accountant and the early childhood centre manager, who is a qualified educator.</p><p>The early childhood centre's licence has recently been extended to cater for up to 75 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. As a result, the roll and the number of staff have more than doubled. The building has been extended to cater for these numbers. The outdoor learning environments have also been enlarged and upgraded, and the original interior fully refurbished.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified the need to develop robust self review and appraisal systems, and improve the quality of programme planning, implementation and evaluation. Further support is required in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming and inclusive of all children and their whānau. Children's cultural backgrounds are visible in the environment and they demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They transition well into the centre and on to school.</p><p>Over the past 18 months, staff have focused their attention on establishing systems and practices that are appropriate for the new roll numbers, staff and learning environments. A practice manager, who has extensive teaching and leadership experience, has recently been employed to raise the quality of teaching practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The early childhood manager has identified areas that require improvement and teachers have had many opportunities to build their professional knowledge and the quality of teaching. While there have been robust discussions, there has been minimal improvement to date.</p><p>Further development is needed to make teachers' interactions with children more meaningful and useful and to help increase the complexity of child-led learning. Effective assessment, programme planning and evaluation processes are yet to be established.</p><p>Good basic self-review processes have recently been implemented and involve the whole early childhood team, including the early childhood manager and practice leader. Teachers require urgent support to improve their use of internal evaluation to lift the quality of their provision for children.</p><p>A challenge is for governance, management and leadership roles and practices to be formalised and implemented in a way that results in continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for centre development include establishing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a robust appraisal system and individual teacher development plans to improve professional knowledge and practice and to support the implementation of new learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective governance and leadership approaches that engage the team in developing an organisational culture of ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum planning, implementation and evaluation that reflects the centre's philosophy, the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and contributes to consistently good quality provision for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systematic and responsive internal evaluation that uses indicators of high quality practice and results in ongoing improvement. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangere East Family Service Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular, improvement focused internal evaluation and teacher performance appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum practices that reflect the curriculum framework and knowledge of relevant theories and practices in early childhood education</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1,2,3,4,7, GMA6,7; Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 43(1a)</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mangere East Family Service Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>8 September 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
