</table><p>The October 2015 report identified a number of areas for development. There is limited evidence to show these were adequately addressed and they remain a priority for improvement.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Capital City Preschool is a community-based early childhood service, situated in Wellington's central business district. The centre provides education and care for 30 children from three to five years of age. It serves a diverse community. At the time of this review, twelve of the children come from backgrounds where English is not the first language spoken at home.</p><p>A board of parents provides oversight of strategic planning, financial management, personnel and policy development. Day-to-day management is the responsibility of the centre manager and the operations manager who support the teaching team.</p><p>The staffing team is well established and the majority of teachers are trained and registered. Since the October 2015 ERO report, two teachers have joined the staff and one is provisionally registered. External expertise is provided by specialist music and yoga teachers who support the learning programme.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is to 'provide excellent education and care for children, help them fulfil their potential and facilitate their progress to school and the wider world'.</p><p>Key next steps identified in the previous ERO report to be given priority included: play-based curriculum; bicultural perspective; assessment for learning; understanding of self review; developing and refining the board's governance roles and responsibilities.</p><p>While some progress is evident, priorities for ongoing development continue to include: bicultural perspective; assessment for learning; understanding of self review and internal evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming and responsive to children and their families. Children's independence is promoted and they are encouraged to make choices and decisions about their learning experiences. They play cooperatively with their peers and engage in sustained play. Teachers use a range of strategies to work appropriately alongside children. They recognise and respond to opportunities to engage in and extend children's learning. Literacy and numeracy are integrated into programmes. Routines are well established and consistently implemented giving children confidence and security.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well provided for and teachers access external support when necessary.</p><p>Opportunities are provided for children to participate in aspects of tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers are committed to strengthening their use of te reo MƒÅori and have recently participated in professional learning and development (PLD) in bicultural practices. A next step is to plan a more strategic approach to enabling educational success as MƒÅori. This is not yet evident in practice.</p><p>Assessment shows that teachers observe children's interests and, at times, recognise the learning. Information about children's progress and wellbeing is regularly shared with parents and whƒÅnau and their responses are welcomed. A more consistent approach to assessment is required to better reflect:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning and intentional teaching for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of children's actual learning and progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents' aspirations in planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have indicated that they intend to undertake some PLD focused on <em>Te WhƒÅriki: Early Childhood Curriculum 2017</em>. Implementing this new learning so that it is reflected in centre practices should lead to a richer understanding of the curriculum and enhanced learning outcomes.</p><p>It is timely for the appraisal policy to be reviewed to include a clear procedure that focuses on improving practice and outcomes for children. Consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clear, specific and measurable goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focused observations of practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust and timely feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are improvement focused and regularly reflect on their practice. Internal evaluation is in the early stages of development. A more strategic, in-depth approach, focused on evaluation, should strengthen decision making and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>A distributed model of leadership enables teachers to take on additional responsibilities and grow their role. Further consideration should be given to how leaders can more effectively monitor practices such as assessment, appraisal and internal evaluation.</p><p>The board of trustees has recently engaged in PLD related to their roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree on the following key next steps for the service:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further strengthen bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take a more strategic approach to promoting educational success for MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance curriculum delivery by refreshing teachers' knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and implement a robust appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement internal evaluation that measures the impact of programmes on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaders to monitor centre practices and systems.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Capital City Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to its licence. In order to address this, the board of trustees must:</p><ol>
<li>no longer offer a holiday programme for children enrolled at school in the licensed early learning service premises during licensed hours.<br><em>[Section 310 Education Act 1989]</em></li>
</ol><p>To improve practice Capital City Preschool should establish systems to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>monitor the expiry date of medications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop robust documented processes for excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the service has developed processes to monitor medications and document excursions.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Capital City Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>6 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
