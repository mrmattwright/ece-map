</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindy Totz is one of a group of four privately owned education and care services, located in the Queenwood suburb of Hamilton. The centre is licensed for up to 30 children aged from approximately 2.5 to 5 yrs. At the time of this review the centre roll was 51. The centre offers full-day, morning or afternoon sessions.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that it offers a semi-structured programme with a focus on literacy and mathematics for children within a safe, warm and nurturing learning environment. An emphasis is also placed on developing positive, reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whānau.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified the need for centre leaders to undertake a review of culture and identity, and develop strategies to focus on children’s interests and learning dispositions. These areas are being addressed but there are aspects that require further strengthening.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are actively engaged in sustained activity and play. The environment is well resourced, providing children with opportunities that support their learning. The semi-structured programme provides a wide choice of activities. Children can choose to work alongside teachers or independently. Literacy, music, science and mathematics are naturally integrated into the daily programme. Children are confident and curious with a strong sense of belonging and their leaning is well supported.</p><p>Māori children benefit from teachers who lead daily waiata, karakia, and use some basic words and phrases. Te reo Māori is visible in wall displays. Resources, including books and puzzles, also support the bicultural curriculum for all learners.</p><p>There are strong partnerships with parents and many opportunities for them to participate in their child's learning. Learning is shared through portfolios and termly progress reports, where learning outcomes are clearly identified. A next step is to ensure the language, culture and identity of Māori children and other cultures are more visible in portfolios. In addition, learning stories should consistently capture what teachers know about individual children's strengths and interests. Consideration should be given to making portfolios more accessible and visible, enabling children and their parents to regularly revisit previous learning.</p><p>Children who require educational support are clearly identified and teachers work in close partnership with parents and external agencies. Highly inclusive practice supports these children to experience positive learning outcomes. Transitions into and within the centres are well managed and supported. These are responsive to individual children and their parents. Children feel safe, secure and ready to learn.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive to children’s learning and wellbeing. They have developed warm, nurturing relationships with children and know families well. Children are supported and encouraged to share and play collaboratively, and children benefit from teachers professional knowledge in supporting their oral language and literacy learning.</p><p>The supervisor has established a culture of trust where teachers are supported to build their professional capabilities. She has participated in professional development in leadership and is establishing a team culture where teachers work collaboratively in the best interests of children.</p><p>There is a clear vision and direction for the centre. The centre owners have collaborated with the teaching teams and goals have been developed that are regularly monitored by management and the supervisors. There is an alignment between the strategic plan, annual plan, philosophy, and teachers professional development. Sound systems and practices contribute to continuous improvement for children and their families.</p><p>A newly implemented appraisal system has been introduced to build teacher capability. Teachers use inquiry goals to promote positive outcomes for children. An effective process for internal evaluation is being implemented and is focused on enhancing learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Kindy Totz are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural assessment practices and the use of learning dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidate the appraisal process to include regular mentoring and documented observations of teaching practice, which includes specific feedback and forward.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindy Totz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindy Totz will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>6 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
