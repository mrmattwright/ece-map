<h3>Background</h3>
<p>‚ÄúKo Mauao te MaungaKo Rangataua te TahunaKo NgƒÅti Hƒì te hapu whai mana o te roheKo NgƒÅti P≈´kenga te iwi whakƒÅruruhauo Te Whare WhƒÅnau o Maungaarangi"</p>
<p>Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre, a purposefully designed whare, is situated on the grounds of Welcome Bay School. It is situated on large sloping grounds where children and their whƒÅnau have the opportunity to explore and challenge themselves in a natural environment. A whƒÅnau room is attached to the kindergarten where whƒÅnau engage in parent education workshops covering topics such as healthy cooking. The kindergarten continues to build a strong relationship with the school. This relationship helps make transition to school seamless for whƒÅnau and their children.</p>
<p>NgƒÅ P≈´rƒÅkau MƒÅori (legends) underpins Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre and whƒÅnau centre philosophy, assessment and learning. The purakau relate to all of the five Pou of Ko Te Ngakau Aroha (Holistic well-being), WhƒÅnaupiripiri (Families and community working together),Whenua WhƒÅngaihia (Living alongside the natural world), NgƒÅ Kete Marama (Explore and learn) and Wairua (Spiritual essence and magic.) These pou and ahua ako guide and shape the teaching and learning of the mokopuna and their whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>Equitable practices that promote positive outcomes for all children and whƒÅnau are well supported by Tauranga Regional Kindergarten (TRK).</p>
<p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior teachers oversee and support the professional work of kindergartens. This work is supplemented by a resource teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao MƒÅori.</p>
<p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with an emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities; education for sustainability; meeting community needs and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There are systematic processes and highly effective self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of teaching and education and care provided by this kindergarten.</p>
<p>Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre operates six hour sessions from Monday to Friday. The current roll of 40 children includes 30 of MƒÅori descent.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Manaakitanga Kindergarten and Family Centre is infused throughout all aspects of the curriculum and life of the kindergarten. The collective knowledge and contributions of the whƒÅnau of Maungaarangi is pivotal to the philosophy. The knowledge and expertise of all members of the whƒÅnau are maximised and celebrated. WhƒÅnau work together in the best interest of all children reflecting the belief 'He tƒÅonga ngƒÅ mokopuna'. Through this work, whƒÅnau and children are developing their understanding of the world and their place in te ao MƒÅori.</p>
<p>The head teacher, with support from the senior teacher, provides highly effective professional leadership of the kindergarten. Her approach to leadership is nurturing, empowering and responsive to the interest and aspirations of the whƒÅnau. The head teacher sets high expectations with a strong focus on teaching and learning, in keeping with the kaupapa of the philosophy.</p>
<p>Since ERO‚Äôs last review in 2012 strategic and annual planning along with assessment and teaching practices have been strengthened through shared leadership that promotes self-review involving teachers and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>WhƒÅnau actively engage in a wide range of opportunities that supports them as parents, and involves them in children's learning, kindergarten organisation, and leadership of events and initiatives. A feature of these opportunities is the learning for parents that supports a positive transition to school, and highlights the importance of ongoing engagement in their children's education.</p>
<p>A carefully considered bicultural framework that is based on NgƒÅ P≈´rƒÅkau MƒÅori (legends) effectively guides the kaupapa for teaching and learning at Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre. The five pou influence the core learning and outcomes for tamariki, enabling them to stand tall on their turangawaewae and be affirmed as tangata whenua. Through intentionally developed environments that reflect MƒÅori principles of kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga and wairua, children are learning to respect, nurture and care for Papat≈´anuku. They have been successfully meeting the requirements of <em>Enviroschools</em> bronze criteria.</p>
<p>The pou provide an assessment framework that is culturally relevant and affirming of all learners in this community. Each child, their whƒÅnau and teachers‚Äô together engage in the process of exploring learning possibilities. NgƒÅ pukapuka ako (learning journal) show teachers' skilful interpretation of children's holistic learning. Children demonstrate strong ownership of these records, enjoy revisiting their learning, recognising possibilities, and seeking challenges for future learning.</p>
<p>Teachers‚Äô belief in children as capable and self-motivated learners is at the heart of teaching practice. Teachers promote children's independent risk taking, exploration and encourage children to confidently share their expertise with others. Children‚Äôs self determination, empathy and social competencies are fostered through teachers‚Äô deep understanding of MƒÅori children's mana, wairua and mauri. Te reo is nurtured in the kindergarten environment by teachers, children and their whƒÅnau. WhƒÅkawhanaungatanga is the foundation that supports the learning of children, their whƒÅnau and teacher.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and the kindergarten have identified that through the framework of NgƒÅ P≈´rƒÅkau MƒÅori it is important for the whƒÅnau to consolidate and further develop current good practices that influence the curriculum, outcomes of teacher appraisal and self review.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
