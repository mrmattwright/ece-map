</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>City Impact Church Childcare Centre is licensed to provide all day education and care for 37 children including up to 12 aged under two years. Infants and toddlers have their own separate play space with good visibility into the area for older children. Children attending come from a variety of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The service's purpose is to enhance the development of children in all areas of biblical belief. Strong Christian values underpin the philosophy. This is the service's first ERO review.</p><p>The manager and team leader are qualified teachers and provide leadership for the teaching team. The team consists of three other qualified teachers, one teacher in training and three unqualified staff. A business manager and financial controller provide management support.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children freely explore the environment and engage in play with the resources available to them. Some children sustain their play for extended periods. Children are respectful of each other and socialise well together. Teachers provide good quality care for the children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from sensitive caregiving. Teachers recognise the communication styles of individual children and respond appropriately to their needs. They maintain a calm pace for these younger children.</p><p>The teaching team reflects the cultures of the children, whose home languages are valued and supported by the team. The service has identified bicultural practice as an area for continued development.</p><p>The special character of the service, expressed through the biblical curriculum, is planned into the daily programme and evident in the environment. The mat-time routine allows time for prayer and song. A transition-to-school programme for four year olds provides opportunities for literacy and numeracy learning.</p><p>The outdoor area for all children is on a deck, which is partially covered to provide shade. Teachers could now review the layout and resourcing of the centre in order to provide more challenges for children and support the development of complex play and learning.</p><p>Teachers identify children's interests and set learning objectives for them based on their observations. Programme planning is strongly linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children's portfolios contain a mix of individual and group learning stories and include parents' aspirations for their children's learning.</p><p>A new teaching team has recently been established. Centre leaders have reviewed the teacher appraisal system. They have developed a robust system for mentoring teachers whose practising certificate is provisional. Statements of teaching and learning, specific to the Mount Wellington context, are being developed. These will sit under the service's Christian based philosophy statement to enhance teaching practice.</p><p>Centre leaders are working to establish a culture of good quality. They should now consider developing indicators of effective practice to empower teachers and build a cohesive team. Strengthening the evaluative aspects of self review will help the team to provide more positive outcomes for children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps to enhance their teaching practice include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing effective questioning techniques so teachers more successfully promote children's curiosity, complex thinking and oral language development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further strengthening programme planning to demonstrate continuity and the developing complexity of children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening evaluation of the programme through a focus on children's learning and effectiveness of teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>continuing to refine and strengthen strategic planning, and the alignment between the annual plan, internal evaluation and teacher appraisal, to support the achievement of strategic goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of City Impact Church Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of City Impact Church Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>10 July 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
