</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwioz Childcare Ltd Hop Skip Learn 00 is one of five home-based education and care networks operating under the umbrella of KiwiOz Childcare Ltd Hop Skip Learn. The service provides support to families who have employed a nanny to look after their children in their own home. KiwiOz also supports families and nannies with professional development, administration and payroll services. Most of the nannies in this network have undertaken an early childhood course or qualification.</p><p>This network is licensed for 80 children in the northern area of Auckland. Since ERO's 2013 report three more networks have been established, including one in Wellington. The owner continues to provide comprehensive governance and leadership with effective nanny recruitment, placement and support. She works with an Auckland manager, a programme manager and a skilled administration team. Qualified teachers visit nannies once or twice a month, or more regularly depending on individual needs. They provide nannies with ideas and guidance for the care and education of infants, toddlers and older children.</p><p>The KiwiOz vision is ‘to enrich lives through care and education'. The philosophy underpinning the Hop Skip Learn programme is 'given respectful relationships, the right environment, and support, children will develop holistically and at their own pace'.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five home-based network reviews in the KiwiOz Childcare Ltd Hop Skip Learn organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Visiting teachers' and nannies' relationships with children and their families are responsive and respectful, and continue to be a strength of this service. Nannies are positive and affirming with children. They keep very good records of each child’s day and note activities that children enjoyed. Daily diaries record interactions with parents and assist nannies to share the child’s progress, and discuss parents' goals. Children’s emotional development is nurtured, as is their sense of belonging and security, through learning in familiar surroundings.</p><p>Nannies know their children very well and are able to respond quickly to their feelings, ideas and care needs. Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing individualised care. Nannies maintain good hygiene and safety practices and are supported by visiting teachers' regular health and safety checks. Nannies include learning opportunities in play experiences, day-to-day household activities and excursions.</p><p>Children have fun and are well supported to follow their play interests in well resourced home environments. The visiting teacher models good practice, makes links to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and supports each nanny's understanding of children's learning. Visiting teachers could now better plan to extend children's interests and support nannies to follow up these next steps for learning.</p><p>Visiting teachers encourage nannies to incorporate te reo me ngā tikanga Māori into their programme. This is a continuing focus and area for ongoing development with nannies. This will assist them to support the implementation of a curriculum that incorporates Māori language and perspectives.</p><p>Parents report high levels of satisfaction with the home-based education and care that nannies provide. Some parents contribute to children's portfolios. These learning records are compiled by nannies and contain artwork, photographs, visiting teacher reports and observations of each child. Parents are also able to be involved and informed by electronic portfolios and social media.</p><p>KiwiOz managers and visiting teachers work collaboratively with nannies to provide children with good quality education and care. They share a philosophical belief in the benefits of home-based care and learning for children and their families.</p><p>Group events and excursions are an opportunity for children to socialise with a larger group of children and other adults. Visiting teachers use group events to promote good practices and to introduce children to equipment and experiences. Nannies express appreciation of opportunities to network with others and to share ideas. They appreciate the support that they receive from visiting teachers and the opportunities for professional development.</p><p>The service assists parents to choose a nanny who is the best match for their family. The KiwiOz organisation has sound employment processes, including the induction of new nannies. Visiting teachers ensure that nannies are familiar with parent and service expectations and understand their legal obligations in providing education and care in the family home.</p><p>Effective management and administration underpins service operations. The owner has a strong commitment to continuous improvement. The service's philosophy and vision are evident across all practices and policies. A comprehensive policy framework outlines individualised and clear guidelines and sets expectations for visiting teachers and nannies.</p><p>Purposeful internal evaluation has been established and is beginning to assist the review of current practices. The manager should now implement regular visiting teacher appraisals that align with Education Council requirements and the Ministry of Education resource, <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders agree that next steps for the service are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop education focused goals to inform strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve internal evaluation systems by evaluating the impact of change on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly document how visiting teachers coach and guide nanny/educator practice.</p>
</li>
<li>review transition-to-school practices to ensure programmes reflect best practice in early childhood education.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwioz Childcare Ltd Hop Skip Learn 00 completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the management should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all nannies have a documented supervision plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents more consistently give signed permission for excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwioz Childcare Ltd Hop Skip Learn 00 will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 April 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3><a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">Review Coverage</a></h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
