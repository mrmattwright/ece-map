</table><p>Mozarts is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mozarts is a privately owned, long-established preschool. It is situated near Merivale and uses a church hall that has been renovated to suit the purpose of the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Children come from a wide geographical area to attend this centre because of the specific nature of the performing arts programme.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in meeting the recommendations from the 2011 ERO report. This includes improving self-review capabilities and teacher appraisal.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs values are strongly reflected in the programme and environment. Teachers and parents have a shared understanding and commitment to the strong focus on children‚Äôs learning through the performing arts.</p><p>There is a wide range of activities attractively set up in the inside and outside areas that give children good choices for following their interests. These activities often arise from the ideas that have been developed during group storytelling times.</p><p>Teachers notice children well and support them to follow their interests. They prompt them to extend their thinking and imagination, and help them to express themselves through oral language, music and drama.</p><p>Children are focused and engaged by the programme which uses storytelling to make learning fun. It also challenges children to think in different ways through the performing arts. This approach effectively integrates literacy and numeracy. It particularly supports the development of children‚Äôs leadership and independence, and stimulates the way children write, and understand mathematics.</p><p>Teachers have focused on ways to strengthen the bicultural aspects of the programme. They are increasing their use of te reo MƒÅori. Children enjoy singing and participate well in waiata.</p><p>Teachers relate positively with children and families. These relationships add to children‚Äôs sense of belonging.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is reported to parents through well-presented and informative portfolios. The best examples show how the child‚Äôs interests have been developed, the learning that has taken place, what the next learning focus might be, and how learning progresses over time. Parents are given good opportunities to support their children‚Äôs learning and to participate in aspects of the programme.</p><p>Centre self review is effectively used to make improvements to learning and teaching that benefit children. Centre-wide reviews are well planned and regularly monitored by the teachers at staff meetings.</p><p>Teachers effectively reflect on, and evaluate their own teaching and development as part of the appraisal process. Teachers receive useful feedback against personal goals. This feedback helps them to use their individual strengths and identify different ways to interest and engage children in learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has developed a learning and teaching story framework that is based on the qualities and attitudes of successful learners in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Some teachers are using this well to identify and report children‚Äôs progress to parents. The next steps to improve children‚Äôs assessment include:</p><ul>
<li>supporting all teachers to use the learning and teaching story framework more consistently so that parents can gain a wider understanding about their children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing</li>
<li>extending opportunities for children to contribute more to their learning stories.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have identified that the next steps to further support the development of children‚Äôs learning are to:</p><ul>
<li>review the concept of mathematics within the programme</li>
<li>further develop the use of technologies and software that supports the centre‚Äôs philosophy.</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified the need for leaders and teachers to consult with parents of MƒÅori children. This consultation should include ways the centre can further support children to succeed as MƒÅori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mozarts completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mozarts will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>25 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
