<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Otaki Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team, and for liaison with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten is situated on the Kapiti Coast, in the township of Otaki. A highly positive and collaborative teaching team provides strong support and manaaki for children and their families. There is a deep and authentic sense of care and concern for people and place. At all levels, positive, nurturing and respectful relationships are highly evident. Transitions into the kindergarten and on to primary school are affirming and inclusive.</p>
<p align="left">The environment is fascinating for children to investigate. Sustainability is integral to the various projects and themes that are explored. Most resources and furniture are handmade or recycled, which gives uniqueness to the setting and the programme. Children plant, cultivate or cook the food produced, and use natural materials in artwork.</p>
<p align="left">Children&rsquo;s views and suggestions are sought. They are empowered as decision makers, working closely with friends and adults to share their ideas and discoveries. They show a strong sense of belonging and confidence and regularly suggest and plan activities. Teachers are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests, questions and observations as they learn through play. Children and adults show enthusiasm as they explore developing skills and concepts together.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers use daily routines and transition times as key learning opportunities. They demonstrate respect for children and their choices. Independence, cooperation and self care are fostered. Younger peers are supported by older experts. The tone is highly inclusive, all children are valued for their individual strengths and are able to work at their own pace and level of involvement. Effort and ideas are celebrated.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten team has a shared vision, philosophy and goals. These are clearly evident in practice. Teachers value and use self review for improvement. Otaki Kindergarten is well placed to continue to provide high quality care and education.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Otaki Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Otaki Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The Otaki Kindergarten head teacher and teachers are an established and experienced team. They organise the children into two groups, known as Tuakana and Teina, according to age and development. The kindergarten has received recognition for its strong focus on sustainability.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Philosophy The team&rsquo;s rich philosophy is deeply embedded in practice. Otaki Kindergarten puts the strengths and interests of the individual child at the centre of the curriculum. Authentic and meaningful learning experiences are provided so that children learn by doing. Hands-on activities help children develop a range of relevant skills and concepts at their own pace, and in partnership with their friends and adults.</p>
<p align="left">Learning environment The attractive grounds and gardens of the kindergarten are highly interesting for young children to explore. Many secret and quiet places are provided for children to discover and watch insects and other creatures. There is a good array of equipment that encourages physical and dramatic play. Mathematical, literacy, science and technological pursuits are supported by thoughtfully-considered areas for experimenting, investigating and recording developing ideas.</p>
<p align="left">Relationships Whanaungatanga and community engagement are central to the kindergarten&rsquo;s culture. Interactions are very warm, welcoming and nurturing. Care and manaaki is embedded in relationships and actions. Families are treated with respect. They show a deep sense of trust in staff and are confident to discuss needs and interests with them. Parents are encouraged to explore the environment with their child. Many stay to play during the session. Support and partnership is highly evident.</p>
<p align="left">Te ao M&#257;ori A strong commitment to promoting success for M&#257;ori is a key facet of the team&rsquo;s philosophy and practice. A rich partnership with wh&#257;nau and local iwi is highly evident, and continues to grow through review and consultation. Members of the nearby marae have a close association with teachers and children and enjoy sharing their stories, expertise and te reo M&#257;ori with the kindergarten. This strong partnership is mutually beneficial.</p>
<p align="left">Teaching team Effective leadership promotes and makes good use of the strengths and expertise of teachers. A committed and positive team ethic is clearly evident. Teachers have enthusiasm and a collective &lsquo;can do&rsquo; attitude, which embraces new ideas and improvement.</p>
<p align="left">Programme planning Teachers know the children well. Team discussion helps them to shape the programme in response to evolving strengths, interests and needs. They listen, observe, and respond to key learning opportunities. Since the 2008 ERO review, teachers have worked to further enhance planning and assessment. Children&rsquo;s kindergarten books are attractive, individualised and have a clear focus on documenting their ideas and choices in learning.</p>
<p align="left">Learning through play Children engage in purposeful, sustained play and exploration. They are confident and enthusiastic in their activities. A strong sense of belonging is evident. Children are confident to initiate conversations, to share their discoveries and achievements, and to ask for support from adults or peers. They move and adapt equipment and resources to suit their play needs. Well-timed conversations and placement of resources by adults further enhance play. There is a clear sense of fun and wonder.</p>
<p align="left">Routines Routines are thoughtfully considered. Teachers model and promote cooperation and respect for others and for the environment. The tone is peaceful and harmonious. Self care and independence are fostered. For example, children can make and cook their own pizza using produce from the gardens when they are hungry. Younger peers are helped by older experts.</p>
<p align="left">Partnership The teaching team has a strong culture of collaboration within the kindergarten and also with the community. This includes other early childhood services, education professionals, support agencies and schools. Teachers are keen to show and share ideas, philosophy and high quality practices with others to enhance early childhood education overall.</p>
<p align="left">Self review Spontaneous and planned reviews are well used to scrutinise practice. Teachers are highly reflective. The association&rsquo;s introduction of Te Manawa as a guiding resource for kindergartens has helped the team refine its self-review practices. The head teacher effectively builds team practice using self review as a guide to improvement, with positive outcomes for children, families and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h4>Area for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Assessment, planning and evaluation Teachers are keen to further enhance processes for planning and assessment. An existing forum for team discussion could be better used for reviewing children&rsquo;s progress toward their goals at key points in time. Possibilities for adapting resources and shaping the programme would guide planning in a considered way, and ensure ideas for providing challenge and extending learning are shared and recorded.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>

<p align="left">The kindergarten culture is highly inclusive. All teachers model warmth, openness and interest in others. They show great empathy and understanding. Families and children are well supported by effective transition practices. Information about a child&rsquo;s strengths, interests and specific needs is shared openly in a three-way conversation between families, staff and support agencies.</p>
<p align="left">Children with special needs are nurtured as confident members of the kindergarten. Specific programmes are planned and reviewed regularly, and teachers ensure the environment and resources are well aligned to their needs. Their achievements are affirmed by adults and their peers. They are supported in following their interests. These children are viewed as competent learners, with their own gifts and talents.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Otaki Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Otaki Kindergarten</p>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Otaki Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Otaki Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team, and for liaison with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten is situated on the Kapiti Coast, in the township of Otaki. A highly positive and collaborative teaching team provides strong support and manaaki for children and their families. There is a deep and authentic sense of care and concern for people and place. At all levels, positive, nurturing and respectful relationships are highly evident. Transitions into the kindergarten and on to primary school are affirming and inclusive.</p>
<p align="left">The environment is fascinating for children to investigate. Sustainability is integral to the various projects and themes that are explored. Most resources and furniture are handmade or recycled, which gives uniqueness to the setting and the programme. Children plant, cultivate or cook the food produced, and use natural materials in artwork.</p>
<p align="left">Children&rsquo;s views and suggestions are sought. They are empowered as decision makers, working closely with friends and adults to share their ideas and discoveries. They show a strong sense of belonging and confidence and regularly suggest and plan activities. Teachers are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests, questions and observations as they learn through play. Children and adults show enthusiasm as they explore developing skills and concepts together.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers use daily routines and transition times as key learning opportunities. They demonstrate respect for children and their choices. Independence, cooperation and self care are fostered. Younger peers are supported by older experts. The tone is highly inclusive, all children are valued for their individual strengths and are able to work at their own pace and level of involvement. Effort and ideas are celebrated.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten team has a shared vision, philosophy and goals. These are clearly evident in practice. Teachers value and use self review for improvement. Otaki Kindergarten is well placed to continue to provide high quality care and education.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
