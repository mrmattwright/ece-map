</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matua Mo E Tama Aoga Vagahau Niue Preschool is a well-established community-based total immersion service located within the Southern Cross Campus grounds in Mangere. It is one of five Pacific early childhood centres located in newly purpose-built facilities. The centre is licensed for 40 children including up to 8 children under two years old.</p><p>This service provides a cultural setting with a strong emphasis on Vagahau Niue language, culture and traditional practices and maintain a Christian perspective. Children are mostly Niuean and some are from other Pacific heritages. They attend for all day education and care.</p><p>The service is governed by a Trust Board which includes representatives of elders and leaders from the Niuean community, the founder, centre manager and teachers. The centre employs mostly qualified teachers.</p><p>The board and staff have made very good progress in addressing the recommendations from the 2013 ERO report. These included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a programme that better support children’s interest and engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the usefulness of assessment and planning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening self-review practices for ongoing centre improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Staff have used the centre's self-review processes to significantly improve the outdoor area to strongly reflect Vagahau Niue.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is evident in practice and underpins all aspects of centre operations and relationships at the centre. The promotion of Vagahau Niue informs teaching and learning and guides partnerships with parents and the centre's strategic priorities.</p><p>Children are confident and enjoy a strong sense of belonging. They care for each other, and show responsibility and self-help skills. Their independence and leadership is encouraged. They benefit from the calm and gentle tone in the centre and reciprocal relationships with each other and with adults.</p><p>Parents are strongly encouraged and involved in the centre. There is a focused approach to building parent understanding of ECE practices. Many have chosen to bring their children to the centre because of the commitment given to Niuean identity, culture and language. Their positive feedback of the programme has enhanced teacher's programme planning for children.</p><p>The newly purpose-built environment offers a fun, modern well-resourced and attractive space for children to learn. Teachers have personalised the environment to reflect Vagahau Niue in Aotearoa. Teachers have considered how to offer separate learning areas for children to use.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard to strengthen their own capability and are responsive to mentoring opportunities. They are very passionate about improvement and have an open attitude to change. They have built a close knit community with children and their whānau. Teachers work hard to use internal and external professional learning opportunities to increase positive outcomes for children. They could extend the process by evaluating the impact of their practice and challenge their assumptions and expectations about children's learning.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to children's languages, cultures and Vagahau Niue in Aotearoa. Planning, evaluation and assessment is increasingly focused on children's interests, strengths and characteristics. <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, informs teacher's planning. Rich records of children's learning show how children's perspectives are valued and offer parents the opportunities to give feedback to teachers.</p><p>The centre manager is an influential leader in the wider Niuean community. He leads and manages the strategic direction of the centre. Together with a curriculum manager and supervisor, they form a leadership and management team that oversee the daily operation of the centre. Leaders encourage teachers' professional development and support them in areas for improvement.</p><p>There are good systems in place with a growing focus on accountability and ongoing centre improvement. Increased documentation of processes and procedures has enabled leaders to manage the daily operation of the centre. The management team is cohesive and collaborative and are committed to promoting the philosophy of Vagahau Niue.</p><p>A curriculum manager provides professional support and guidance to the team and continues to build teacher's capability and professional practice. She is a leader in the community and encourages teachers to share their strengths and achieve their developmental goals.</p><p>The board promote the long term vision and mission of the centre and maintains the historic ongoing relationships that represent Vagahau Niue's traditional and cultural beliefs. They support the aspirations of the Niuean parent community and are focused on ensuring the centre is successful for children. Relationships with the staff are built on mutual respect and professional trust and high expectations for success is evident. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To strengthen their good practice and effectiveness, leaders and staff should continue to embed effective practice in all areas of teaching and learning, governance and management. They should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine documentation of children's complexity of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the effectiveness of the programme for under 2’s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the effective use of internal evaluation to embed effective practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matua Mo E Tama Aoga Vagahau Niue Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matua Mo E Tama Aoga Vagahau Niue Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
