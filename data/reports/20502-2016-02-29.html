</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Starfish Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned centre in Stanmore Bay, Whangaparaoa. It provides full-day care and education for children aged from two to five years. The owner, supervisor, and many of the staff are experienced teachers and long-serving members of the centre. The premises have been thoughtfully renovated and resourced to create an attractive and stimulating learning environment.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is guided by principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers provide an environment where children are valued as individuals, and where their curiosity is encouraged and extended. Children benefit from the warm and caring relationships that are evident in their interactions with teachers.</p><p>The centre has an inclusive, family-oriented approach. Staff are committed to developing strong relationships and effective communication with families/whƒÅnau. Parents affirm the sense of family evident in the centre and the care and education provided for their children.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. Staff have responded well to recommendations from the 2013 ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engaged in their play. They are confident and articulate, and have positive interactions with each other and with adults. Effective teaching practices foster child-directed play, stimulate children‚Äôs language skills, thinking and creativity, and facilitate sustained, complex play. Children are well supported to develop independence and social skills. Teachers skilfully incorporate early literacy and numeracy learning in meaningful ways. Centre leaders agree that literacy and numeracy could be more explicitly incorporated and visible in the outdoor play activities and environment.</p><p>Learning programmes are based on children‚Äôs emerging interests and underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> principles, strands and goals. Teachers use the notice, recognise and respond model well to assess and plan learning programmes which incorporate centre-wide themes, group and individual focuses. Good systems have been developed to build teachers‚Äô understanding and implementation of this model, including those relating to assessment and planning documentation.</p><p>The centre is very well resourced and teachers encourage children to use resources in a variety of ways. Separate rooms and outdoor areas provide age-appropriate care and learning activities. Children are also able to interact with all staff and children of other ages, and to enjoy the varied learning areas that the environment offers. Children‚Äôs transitions within the centre are well managed and responsive to individual children‚Äôs requirements. Staff have very good processes to support older children‚Äôs transition to school and are continuing to enhance these processes.</p><p>Staff have established strong relationships with family and whƒÅnau, local schools and wider community. They are continuing to explore ways to extend these positive learning partnerships. Teachers use a range of strategies to provide parents with good information about their children‚Äôs learning and development. Parents have opportunities to contribute to centre programmes, reviews and decision making. The introduction of an electronic system for sharing children‚Äôs learning is enhancing communication and enabling greater input from families into their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Centre leaders have strengthened ways in which they reflect the bicultural heritage of New Zealand. They have also identified this as an area for further development, including identifying staff leadership capability in this area.</p><p>Centre staff have a clear philosophy, vision and strategic direction, which is supported by effective systems and practices. ERO supports centre leaders‚Äô intentions to further develop strategic planning processes.</p><p>Staff work collaboratively in a culture of reflection and ongoing improvement. The owner and head teacher provide high quality professional leadership. Professional learning and development is purposeful and well considered. The centre owner has improved staff appraisal processes and is continuing to strengthen these to incorporate more formal teacher reflection. Useful self-review processes have been established and leaders are continuing to refine and extend these.</p><p>A shared leadership model is providing good opportunities for teachers to take on responsibilities and ownership within the centre. With some recent staff changes, centre leaders are restructuring the leadership model. They are considering ways in which they can further increase distributed leadership to continue to build capacity and sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that the next key steps to extend existing good practice are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop bicultural practices and increase teacher confidence and capability in the use of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>continue to refine and extend recently developed appraisal processes</li>
<li>increase the depth and evaluative nature of teachers‚Äô reflection on their practice</li>
<li>further develop annual planning to more closely support centre strategic goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Starfish Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
<li>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</li>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Starfish Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
