</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 Ltd¬†#2¬†is a privately owned, home-based care service. The office is based in Invercargill. The service operates two networks. This report relates to Network Two.</p><p>All of the educators in this network have some early childhood qualifications and experience. All of them live in Invercargill. They provide care and education in their own homes for children aged from birth-to-school age. Two visiting teachers are responsible for supporting the educators. One is new to the position at Busy Bodies and is an experienced visiting teacher. The other visiting teacher supports educators in Invercargill and is also the owner of the service.</p><p>The service has had a number of changes in the last year, including two new visiting teachers and changes to the office management. The owner has also reduced her level of involvement in the business.</p><p>The owner's vison is to provide affordable, high quality education and care in a home-like setting. This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Busy Bodies Childcare Ltd service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, especially infants and toddlers, benefit from the small group size and consistent caregiving they receive in educators' homes. Many of the educators are long serving and have built close relationships with children and their families over time.</p><p>Children enjoy many opportunities and experiences within the homes and in their local community as part of their education in a home-based setting. For example, they may attend a weekly playgroup or music and movement session, and a transition to school programme organised by the visiting teachers.</p><p>A new e-portfolio system allows for greater and more immediate communication between educators, whƒÅnau and extended family. Visiting teachers are beginning to help educators better show how they document and respond to parents' wishes for their children's learning.</p><p>The visiting teachers visit educators regularly and oversee their work. They provide many opportunities for ongoing professional learning for educators and interested parents.</p><p>The 2011 ERO review identified that aspects of assessment and planning, implementing a bicultural curriculum, and self review were areas for further development. The visiting teachers have begun to make improvements in these areas but these are very recent and still require significant work. The owner and visiting teachers need to take a planned approach to ensure these improvements are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>systematically applied across the whole service to build consistency of visiting teacher and educator practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflected in policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustained over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Systems and practices for governance, management and leadership of the service are not consistent. This review found that the owner, with the support of the visiting teachers, needs to develop new processes and improve existing processes and documentation of these.</p><p>The service philosophy needs to be reviewed. The owner and visiting teachers need to show how the philosophy is evident in practice.</p><p>The strategic plan could more clearly identify goals, priorities and actions for the service. Related systems such as appraisal and professional development should align to the plan. The owner needs to monitor progress against the goals and report this to interested parties.</p><p>The policy and procedure framework does not adequately reflect or cover the scope of the service. The owner needs to further develop and improve procedures and practices for human-resource management, including appraisals, recruitment and induction of staff and educators. She and her team also need to review and redevelop the job descriptions for her role, the visiting teachers and the educators. Policies are often not personalised or entirely relevant to the Busy Bodies Childcare service.</p><p>In 2015 the educators' and visiting teachers' appraisals were incomplete or not carried out. The owner needs to ensure that these happen in a timely manner.</p><p>The roles and responsibilities of the visiting teachers need to be reviewed. Guidelines for visiting teachers need to clearly state the owner's expectations and give greater emphasis to the role of the visiting teacher. In particular, the guidelines need to state how visiting teachers support and coach educators to provide high quality education and care. Educators need to clearly know what support they can receive from the visiting teachers and how often. Visiting teachers should also provide educators with written feedback giving guidance about their work with children and families.</p><p>The owner needs to build a cohesive team between herself and the visiting teachers. They need to find ways to regularly meet to develop and share consistent practices and build team work.</p><p>The owner needs to improve processes for reporting and monitoring. She needs to be assured that visiting teachers and educators are meeting all the requirements and that there is consistency of practice across the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, with the support of the visiting teachers, needs to improve and further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and leadership of the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 Ltd #2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified several areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>HS11: develop a daily checklist for hazards to guide educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HS14: strengthen risk management for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GMA6: develop documented human-resource procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 Ltd #2 will be within two years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>28 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
