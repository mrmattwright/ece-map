</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Castle Kids-Ruru is one of four Christian-based centres in Waikanae under common ownership. The service provides education and care for up to 28 children over the age of two. Of the 45 children currently enrolled, five are MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre philosophy is aligned to the Castle Kids organisation and its Christian values. It emphasises the importance of curiosity, exploration, self-worth, respect and partnerships with whƒÅnau to enable children to become life-long learners.</p><p>A management team has responsibility for governance, management and ongoing operation of the organisation. Day-to-day management of the centre is the responsibility of the centre supervisor, supported by a senior staff member. A new supervisor was appointed in April 2017. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The 2012 and 2015 ERO reports identified that management should continue to develop the appraisal system to include specific goals, targeted observation and feedback about teacher practice to support improved outcomes for children. This has yet to be sufficiently addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have many opportunities to lead their own learning within a curriculum designed to extend their interests. Planned group activities for dramatic play and science promote children's exploration, investigation and self-expression. The bicultural curriculum continues to develop, including more frequent use of te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Strong relationships with parents are well established. A range of strategies to move toward learning-centred partnerships is being implemented. This should increase responsiveness to parent aspirations and children's cultures, languages and identities.</p><p>Teachers are growing their knowledge of te ao MƒÅori within the context of the service. They should continue to strengthen their understanding and use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> and kaupapa MƒÅori to further promote educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>Leaders have identified that increasing their knowledge of individual Pacific cultures, and teaching practices that respond to these, is a key next step.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Parents and teachers collaborate with external agencies to support learning within an inclusive environment. Developing children's social competence is an ongoing focus.</p><p>Portfolios comprehensively document children's participation and interests through centre values and the lens of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A recently revised assessment process provides a holistic view of individual children. A key next step is using this information to intentionally plan to extend individual learning. This should assist evaluation of the progress of learning over time.</p><p>Processes to support children's successful transition to school continue to evolve. Information about children's learning is increasingly shared with local schools. It is timely for teachers to revisit the purpose and content of the four-year-old programme in line with the centre's valued outcomes for children and current practices that support transition to school.</p><p>Regular self review contributes to improvements in many areas of the service. A next step is to develop teachers' collaborative use of evaluation to clearly identify improved outcomes for children against indicators of high quality practice.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report, many of the policies and processes of Castle Kids have undergone significant review with the aid of external support. Processes and practices that foster ongoing improvement and consistency across the organisation requires further strengthening. ERO's external evaluation identifies this is a priority. In particular, governors and managers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisit strategic planning to better define goals, actions and desired outcomes for children to support alignment of key development processes in centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels of the organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen leadership and guidance to build teachers' understanding of high quality practice within the context of each service.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Further support is required to develop teacher practice. The recently revised appraisal system is yet to be fully implemented. Strengthening is necessary to ensure meaningful development of teachers, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formation of actionable, specific goals aligned to service priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formal observation of teacher practice in relation to goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of evidence to demonstrate how changes in teaching practice improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identification of relevant professional learning to more effectively meet teachers' identified needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service leaders agree that the priorities at centre level are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement effective planning and evaluation of learning for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop understanding of strategies that promote educational success for MƒÅori and for Pacific children within their own cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At governance level, priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve the strategic planning framework to promote sustainability of operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen leadership and guidance to develop consistent teacher practice to promote positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement effective teacher appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Castle Kids-Ruru completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration.</p><p>The service provider must implement a formal annual appraisal of the service manager that meets Education Council requirements. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure regular review and analysis of accidents are undertaken to inform hazard management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop positive guidance procedures that reflect the context of the service, to ensure consistency of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of this review, the service has provided additional evidence that shows the development of a form to regularly analyse accidents.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Castle Kids-Ruru will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>15 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
