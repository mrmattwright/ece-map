</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Inspiring Kids Early Learning Limited (previously Pleasant Heights Pre-School) is a large, privately owned early childhood education and care service, located in Rotorua, adjacent to Western Heights Primary School. The centre is licensed for up to 130 children from birth to school age and is organised into three age-based rooms. At the time of this ERO review, 94 children were enrolled including 80 of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>Since ERO's 2014 review the centre has new owners, a new leadership team and many new teachers and support staff. The new owners and centre manager have made considerable progress in addressing the key next steps and compliance issues identified in the 2014 ERO report. These areas related to health and safety, self review, educational leadership, personnel management, teaching practice and the curriculum.</p><p>The centre's vision is to provide quality education in a safe and healthy environment. Through the centre's vision and philosophy the intended outcomes are for children to become independent individuals who can communicate, participate and work with others.</p><p>Current centre-wide self review is focused on strengthening bicultural practices, including teachers' use of te reo MƒÅori throughout the curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new owners and centre manager have developed a vision that clearly promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers have worked collaboratively to create philosophies for each room and an overarching centre philosophy statement. The centre's long-term strategic plan gives focused priority to meeting the holistic needs of all children, ensuring quality curriculum, teaching practice and responsive resourcing. This work has been pivotal in establishing clear direction, common goals and a positive team culture across the centre.</p><p>The centre manager, supported by the owners, demonstrates strong advocacy for the rights of all children. She has established respectful, trusting and reciprocal relationships with children, their whƒÅnau and staff. The centre manager has an intentional approach to growing teachers' and leaders' knowledge and capability. She models genuine care and affection for children, and provides appropriate professional development opportunities, coaching and support for teachers. A culture is being developed that places children at the centre of all decisions.</p><p>The centre manager is providing effective educational leadership of the centre. She has implemented effective self review that has resulted in many positive changes to aspects of relationships, the environment, curriculum and teachers' practice. Strong priority is being given to developing teachers' understanding of, and involvement in self review. Key components of self review are the inclusion of parent/whƒÅnau perceptions and the high level of teacher reflection about their practice and what they could improve for children.</p><p>Teachers share a philosophy and commitment to inclusive education for all children. Their interactions with children are, caring, responsive and sensitive to individual needs. The new transition initiative supports children and whƒÅnau as they enrol, progress through the centre and to school. In addition, teachers have developed positive relationships with local schools, which include reciprocal visits and information sharing.</p><p>Learning environments have been greatly improved since the previous ERO review. Children now have access to many interesting and suitable resources in physical environments that are safe, while offering challenges, and invite children to make decisions and engage in self-chosen exploration and learning. Children are happy and confident to engage in play and routines alongside their peers and teachers.</p><p>The centre manager has introduced clear expectations and frameworks to guide assessment, planning and evaluation for documenting children's interests and learning. Teachers appreciate the direction and guidance from the manager and relevant professional learning and development about recording their observations and planning. This support is enabling them to more confidently and effectively document, notice, recognise and respond to children's interests, dispositions and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build and sustain the positive developments achieved since 2014, centre leaders and teachers need to continue to review and strengthen the following aspects of practice:</p><ul>
<li>Establish expectations for teachers' practice, the curriculum and learning environment in each age-based room that aligns to the philosophy statements.</li>
<li>It is important for the centre to strengthen opportunities for MƒÅori children to be affirmed as MƒÅori and to know that their language, culture and identity are celebrated and valued.</li>
<li>Strengthen the teacher appraisal process to include coverage of all Practising Teacher Criteria of the Education Council of Aotearoa each year and provide constructive feedback to teachers about their practice. The inclusion of cultural competencies for teachers of MƒÅori learners should assist teachers to reflect on and build their bicultural practice.¬†</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation¬†</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre manager accesses whole-centre professional learning and development to grow teacher knowledge and practice in relation to identified key next steps in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Inspiring Kids Early Learning Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Inspiring Kids Early Learning Limited will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 September 2016¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
