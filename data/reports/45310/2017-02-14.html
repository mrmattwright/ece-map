</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Smart Start Care and Education Centre is a privately owned service, licensed to provide all-day education and care for 40 children, including 11 up to two years of age. It is located in Springvale, Whanganui and the majority of children attending are from the local neighbourhood. The physical environment is well organised and welcoming. The outside area has been extended since the March 2014 ERO review.</p><p>A co-owner manages organisational planning, finances, premises and resourcing. The other owner has overall responsibility for curriculum implementation and building teaching capability. The centre has two distinct spaces: one for children aged up to two (Pōtiki); and another for those aged over two years (Mātāmua). Children move freely between these areas. A head teacher is responsible for programme provision in each area.</p><p>Smart Start’s stated mission is to provide high quality early childhood care and education. The centre philosophy indicates this will be achieved through providing a stimulating, nurturing and inviting environment focused on caring for, and teaching children - Hei manaaki, He whakaako, Tamariki. Centre practices emphasise ensuring positive relationships with children, parents and whānau are established and grown.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, there have been significant changes in practices affecting programme planning, assessment, transition and supporting staff improvement. The philosophy has been reviewed and greater opportunity has been provided to enable families to have a meaningful influence on their child's programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for all children. There is an affirming tone that promotes constructive, respectful interactions.</p><p>Children have frequent opportunity to engage in uninterrupted play. Teachers carefully listen to, recognise and document children’s knowledge, skills and dispositions and encourage their development through collaborative planning. They provide resources and environments that encourage exploration that is purposeful and enjoyable. Children’s problem-solving and experimentation are well supported.</p><p>Children access materials linked to their immediate interests. Their developing independence is promoted. Educators are attentive and respond promptly to children’s requests, play alongside them and extend thinking and language. Regular use is made of nearby, local facilities as part of the programme.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are interwoven in daily experiences. Teachers provide meaningful contexts for children to develop oral and written language skills, print awareness and mathematical learning.</p><p>Māori concepts, knowledge, te reo and practices are part of everyday experiences for children. Since the previous ERO review, teachers have strengthened their understanding of what is involved in ensuring successful outcomes for Māori learners. They have explored ways to respect and better support each child to be confident in their own culture and to acknowledge the aspirations held by parents and whānau for their children.</p><p>There is a deliberate approach to extending the culture of the centre to embrace te ao Māori. Programme planning has been adapted to focus more on each child as an individual. Centre leaders are supporting building partnerships to further enable Māori children, parents and whānau to participate in place-based learning. This should support increasing recognition and celebration of their unique identity, language and culture.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions into and within the service, and when moving to school. An individualised approach is supported by effective partnerships between families, schools and the centre. Well-considered information and support materials aid this process. A recent comprehensive review has contributed to a strengthening of practices that support transition.</p><p>Children's progress journals show deepening and increasing complexity of children’s learning. Individual assessments illustrate continuity in skills and knowledge, and demonstrate progress in a range of contexts that are regularly linked to their individual interests. Teachers value and acknowledge parent and whānau aspirations for their children and these are reflected in individual journals.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for strong and secure attachments. Teachers maintain a calm, unhurried pace that encourages children to lead their own learning. They have time to explore, discover and experiment to grow their skills and understandings. The environment provides for the physical and emotional wellbeing, intellectual stimulation and social support of very young children.</p><p>Leaders effectively build the quality of teaching, learning and care for children. There is a strong focus on continual improvement linked to professional learning, reflection, increasing knowledge and self review. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively to further develop practices to ensure better outcomes for children.</p><p>Teacher appraisal continues to be strengthened. The process links closely to the Practising Teacher Criteria and supports increasing cultural competency to respond to Māori learners. Teacher capability is being built through individual goal setting, ongoing self-reflection, appraiser feedback and discussions.</p><p>Self-review processes investigate the effectiveness of curriculum decision making in improving children’s engagement and learning. Appropriate elements of internal evaluation are evident in review practice. Leaders are in the process of developing guidelines to enhance evaluation. This should ensure internal evaluation makes a greater contribution to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager, professional leaders and ERO agree on the following next steps for Smart Start Care and Education Service:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding a number of recently developed systems to support teaching and learning and carrying out ongoing evaluation of the impact of these improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending support of Māori children by further building the inclusion of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in assessment and planning and through increasing engagement with local iwi.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Smart Start Care and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Smart Start Care and Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
