</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paradise for Little Angels is a privately owned and operated education and care centre for children from 0-5 years of age. The owners and most of the staff have been at the centre since before the last ERO review.</p><p>At the beginning of 2017 the centre owners appointed a curriculum leader to support staff in assessment and programme planning. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>While progress has been made in some of the areas for improvement identified in the 2012 ERO review, there are others that require further development. These are identified as next steps in this report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a physical environment that offers challenges and interest and invites them to explore and become fully involved in a wide variety of activities. The expansive outdoor environment is attractive and well designed to encourage exploration that is meaningful and enjoyable for children.</p><p>Teachers are purposeful in the way they recognise and respond to all opportunities to engage in, and extend, children's learning. They are regularly involved in children's play and offer praise and encouragement.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have time and space to freely explore the well-resourced and inviting environment. They have one-to-one responsive interactions with familiar adults who are caring and nurturing. Teachers recognise and make good use of learning opportunities within routines.</p><p>Teachers actively promote peer interactions to support learning. They encourage children to develop their social competence through a range of meaningful contexts such as problem solving and creative play.</p><p>Teachers take regular notice of children in everyday activities to build a picture of what children know, are interested in, and can do. They use this information to further develop their own understanding of children's learning dispositions and to plan how they will respond effectively to extend these.</p><p>Children's cultures are highly visual in the environment. Teachers regularly incorporate te reo and tikanga Māori into the centre programme. Teachers acknowledge the cultural skills and expertise that parents bring to the service and use these well in the programme.</p><p>Older children's transition to school is well supported through frequent visits to neighbouring schools. Teachers have sought the views of parents and new entrant teachers on the dispositions and competences that support this transition. Children at the centre and the local school engage in similar topics at times.</p><p>Teachers regularly reflect on aspects of the programme, practices and routines. They improve their practice through discussion and professional development. Teachers receive regular, useful feedback about their teaching practices. There is an emphasis on whole-centre review to support shared understandings of consistent practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It is now timely for centre leaders to review the vision and philosophy to ensure that they reflect current practice. The recent move to the Reggio Emilia approach to learning, for example, is not reflected in the centre's strategic documents.</p><p>Internal evaluation practices need to be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>including recognition of what is working well and should be retained, as well as what needs to improve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focusing on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including specific measurable indicators that can be used to evaluate progress towards the outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre managers need to provide more support to teachers to implement the planning and assessment practices that have recently been introduced. Consideration should also be given to including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular input from parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integration of children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of teaching strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the centre leaders seek external professional development to support improvements in internal evaluation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paradise for Little Angels completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appropriate checks of sleeping children are undertaken <br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS9.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Paradise for Little Angels will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>29 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
