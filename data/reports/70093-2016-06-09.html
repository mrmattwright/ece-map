</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Wairakei operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood centres across New Zealand.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for children up to school age and is licensed for 64 children, including 16 children aged up-to-two years old. The centre is set up in two rooms; a nursery/toddler room, and a preschool room for the older children. It is well resourced and attractively presented.</p><p>Staff, children and families come from diverse cultures and backgrounds. There are two fully registered and four provisionally registered teachers, two in their second year of training. The centre has a strong focus on growing teachers and leaders.</p><p>Since the March 2013 ERO review, there have been several staff changes. A new centre manager was appointed in 2013. This appointment and other staff selections have strategically supported the centre's philosophy and the specific needs of groups of children. The managers have provided consistent support over many years.</p><p>The centre has made significant progress since the 2013 review. This includes major improvements to the indoor and outdoor areas, curriculum development and changes to a number of procedures and practices. The managers are continuing to develop bicultural programmes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A shared philosophy guides how teachers work with children and their families. Teachers have given careful consideration to what the philosophy and values look like in practice, in both rooms. Teachers highly value the diverse cultural backgrounds of children by ensuring their individual needs, languages, and cultures are recognised and responded to in respectful ways. Some teachers speak often to children and parents in their first languages.</p><p>The welcoming, inclusive environment is underpinned by a strong focus on children's learning. There are opportunities for older children to support younger children in their learning.</p><p>Teachers make good use of the building spaces to extend children‚Äôs learning opportunities. Renovations, suitable resources and equipment support children's independence and learning. The well-presented natural resources and home-like surroundings support children's sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>The needs of infants and toddlers are well met by teachers' use of calm respectful interactions. Children are sensitively cared for and guided by teachers who know them well. Teachers make sure children experience consistency between the routines in their homes and centre.</p><p>Children benefit from responsive interactions with their teachers that promote their learning. They attend regular professional learning and development to improve their teaching practices. Managers have high expectations of a centre culture where teachers regularly discuss and think more deeply about their teaching, what is working well and ways they can improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children have a rich range of curriculum experiences. The programmes are strongly based on children‚Äôs interests, ideas and what they want to learn about. Teachers are making increasing use of parents' aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning, to inform their programme planning and assessment.</p><p>Children‚Äôs physical, health and social skills, are effectively fostered. The teachers promote physical activities with suitable equipment in both the indoor/outdoor areas. Children have challenging obstacle courses and go on regular outings that encourage team and physical skills. The centre provides healthy food for children and supports parents with information about healthy eating.</p><p>Teachers have strong partnerships with families. Useful information is regularly shared with parents and whƒÅnau about what children learn during their time at the centre. This information helps teachers to plan according to children's interests and to assess their learning.</p><p>The managers and teachers have established effective links with local schools. These links support children and their families to experience successful transitions as they move from the centre to school.</p><p>Teachers' strengths are well used. Their leadership potential is recognised and fostered through regular coaching and mentoring.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. The centre manager, professional service manager and the business manager work collaboratively to successfully implement BestStart management systems and promote better outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>BestStart has many systems to help centres improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well, and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>support for centre managers for the day-to-day operation of their centres through regular visits of education and business managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers and teachers have reliably identified, and ERO agrees, that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen MƒÅori perspectives in the curriculum by integrating the values, programmes and practices</li>
<li>formalising the teachers' appraisal system by documenting observations of teaching practices to support teachers' evaluation of their practices</li>
<li>strengthening the evaluative practises of the self-review process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Wairakei completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Wairakei will be in four years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
