</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Haumia Early Childhood Centre is in Otara, Auckland, across from the Tangaroa College Teen Parent Unit (TPU). It was established to provide care and education for the children of teenage parents while they finish their high school education. The centre also caters for children from the wider community, including staff from the local schools, and is licensed to provide for 34 children between birth and five years of age.</p><p>The teaching team is stable, with five of the seven staff now fully qualified teachers. The centre employs a cook to provide plentiful and nutritious meals for the children. A minivan taxi service is available to transport TPU parents and children to the centre. The community appreciates that the teaching team is culturally diverse, with many staff also living locally.</p><p>Prior to the last ERO review in 2011 a management company was appointed to manage the centre. This arrangement continues, providing the governance group with assurance that requirements are met. The outdoor areas have been redeveloped over the last three years to provide shade, and more natural and engaging spaces for children.</p><p>Both ERO reports of the centre have commented on the caring, nurturing environment provided for children, the cultural inclusion and the respectful environment for children and adults. These good practices continue.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are very well cared for. Teachers respond to their individual needs and care routines, particularly for infants and toddlers. This young group of children have a large area, which opens directly to an inviting outdoor area. They receive lots of affection and attention from adults who know them well. They enjoy the connection with their siblings who are able to spend time with them.</p><p>Older children are confident and curious. They enjoy books, writing, puzzles, construction, music and dramatic play. Outside they make good use of what is available to them. These children are highly capable with a strong sense of belonging. ERO notes that the behaviour of both the younger and older groups of children indicates that they would now benefit from more stimulating activities and access to more challenging resources in the centre.</p><p>The governance group has allocated a substantial fund for the centre to provide ‚Äòrich learning experiences‚Äô for children and to promote whƒÅnau participation alongside their children. To date these experiences have included a variety of trips, a zoo visit, snow delivered to the centre, interaction with and learning about animals and attending an orchestra concert. These experiences are helping the centre to achieve its objectives for children in terms of fostering a love of learning, a positive sense of self and connections with the wider community.</p><p>Teachers are warmly welcoming to all children, parents and whƒÅnau. They take time to support new families to feel comfortable in the centre. WhƒÅnau events such as Matariki and Pasifika celebrations and shared meals are very well attended, and indicate the high levels of support for the centre. Families are regularly consulted and changes are made as a result of their input. The centre is eager to further build whƒÅnau involvement in the centre.</p><p>Links have been strengthened between centre and TPU since 2011. The TPU coordinator and centre supervisor meet regularly to discuss the transition of infants into the centre, and how best to support students and their families. The governance group, management and supervisor work together to help ensure that barriers to children‚Äôs attendance are overcome wherever possible. Changes to benefit rules have meant that substantial time is now diverted into organising financial assistance for the young mothers.</p><p>Teachers have participated in professional development around aspects of the curriculum. They have made changes to their assessment, planning and evaluation which encourage them to think more deeply about children‚Äôs learning. Recent changes to self review are also helping staff to reflect on more strategic matters and to gauge how well they are meeting their centre‚Äôs vision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The governance group, management body and staff have identified and taken steps towards:</p><ul>
<li>exploring what successful learning for MƒÅori and Pacific children entails, with a view to strengthening practice in this area</li>
<li>the use of digital technologies in the programme for children, staff and families, particularly in terms of sharing learning</li>
<li>strengthening links with local schools to support children‚Äôs readiness for, and to help ensure smooth transitions for children as they move from the centre to school.</li>
</ul><p>ERO discussed with the governance group, management representative and supervisor the need to also lift the quality of teaching and learning. Managers agreed to support teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>build children‚Äôs language development and thinking skills by talking with children more frequently, and asking more open questions</li>
<li>use consistent strategies to prevent and respond to children‚Äôs challenging behaviour</li>
<li>use their planning processes to provide more challenging learning experiences that engage children and support their learning</li>
<li>ensure that portfolios reflect input from families and show children‚Äôs learning and progress.</li>
</ul><p>The upcoming PLD for centre leaders organised by the external management group should help to promote greater levels of critical inquiry into teaching practice amongst teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Haumia Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Haumia Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>3 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
