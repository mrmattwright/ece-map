</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taradale Kindergarten in Napier provides early childhood education and care for up to 43 children aged over two. Morning sessions cater for three year olds and older children attend for six hours. The current roll is 65 children, including 9 Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operation of 16 kindergartens including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association and support for the general manager. Two educational managers are responsible for building teacher capability. The head teacher provides professional leadership to a very experienced and longstanding teaching team. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa Matauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. He demonstrates a clear vision for Māori children and their whānau.</p><p>Strong relationships and support from parents, families and the wider local community are features of the kindergarten. The positive strengths identified in the October 2012 ERO report continue and progress is evident in embedding sustainability, healthy food choices and self review. <br> A very well-considered kindergarten environment supports successful learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children follow their interests and make choices from carefully considered curriculum opportunities. Teachers facilitate learning through play in a very well-resourced environment. Sustainability, the natural world and science remain very positive features of the programme. Healthy food and physical activity are strongly promoted.</p><p>Children confidently explore and investigate. Teachers decide how best to extend learning through carefully considered teaching strategies. Leadership is encouraged through sharing each child’s expertise and interests. Teachers’ respectful conversations affirm and encourage children’s confidence and thinking.</p><p>Profile books are attractive records of children’s learning and experiences. Learning stories show a range of individual interests and group experiences. Teachers use assessment, planning and evaluation to extend complexity in each child’s learning over time.</p><p>Teachers continue to make good progress in bicultural practices. Te ao Māori is becoming increasingly reflected in children’s learning and in assessment. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are well supported by teachers’ active involvement in association professional learning and use of resources.</p><p>Processes for transitioning children into the kindergarten and on to school, are well developed and continue to strengthen through partnerships with local primary schools.</p><p>Collaborative teamwork and considered and shared leadership support continuity of high quality teaching practice. Very experienced staff contribute to seamless teaching that uses individual and team strengths and interests. Children are valued as unique individuals whose interests form the focus of teaching. Parent views are increasingly contributing to the development of the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to participate in relevant professional learning and development. An improved appraisal process enables teachers to set goals, collect evidence and reflect on the impact of their practices. Further developing the focus of the appraisal process should increase its usefulness in building professional capability.</p><p>Improved self-review processes lead to new developments in practices such as revisiting the kindergarten philosophy and increasing parents' input. Continuing to broaden the scope of self review, sources of evidence and the role of evaluation in the planned curriculum review should improve its impact on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association empowers teachers to use the team’s strengths to respond to children and the parent community. Education managers should continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes to effectively build teacher capability. These include self review, assessment, planning, internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten teachers and education managers should:</p><ul>
<li>further embed and extend the scope and impact of self review, including evaluation</li>
<li>improve appraisal goal setting, evidence, observations, feedback and next steps, to better evaluate its impact on children’s outcomes. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taradale Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taradale Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 December 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
