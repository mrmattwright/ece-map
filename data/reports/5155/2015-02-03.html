</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukete Kindergarten is located in Hamilton and provides sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review, 81 children were enrolled, of whom nine are identified as MƒÅori, and a number of other ethnic groups.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschools</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten‚Äôs quality of education. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten‚Äôs administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>Pukete Kindergarten demonstrates a strong commitment to bicultural practice. Teachers continue to maintain a strong sense of community. The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy is strongly evident in the programme and children‚Äôs development as confident learners is promoted. The head teacher is newly appointed and she is making a positive impact on the kindergarten's operations and practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Pukete Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children experience a high-quality curriculum within a well-organised learning environment. Children have access to stimulating resources that promote self-directed exploration and play. Play spaces are freely available for them to work collaboratively in groups, or independently. Both the indoor and outdoor environments are interesting and challenging and cater well for children's wide range of abilities and interests.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are strongly promoted and integrated throughout the curriculum. Children have extensive opportunities to develop their knowledge and understanding about mathematical and literacy concepts. Tikanga and te reo MƒÅori is valued and promoted through stories, karakia, waiata, tuakana-teina processes and supportive relationships.</p><p>Teachers have engaged in ongoing professional development in current early childhood theory and practice. They use highly effective teaching strategies that support children‚Äôs learning. Teachers build on children‚Äôs prior knowledge, use open-ended questions and encourage children to problem solve and extend their thinking. Teachers also provide children with ongoing positive affirmation for their efforts and contributions. They promote social competencies and encourage them to consider other viewpoints.</p><p>Teachers establish strong relationships with families. Parents and whƒÅnau contribute to decision making about the curriculum, assessment of children's learning and participate in events such as Matariki celebrations. Parents appreciate the opportunities to network with one another and value the positive relationship they have with teachers. Teachers advocate well for children. A strength of the kindergarten continues to be the way that children with special abilities and needs are cared for in an inclusive culture.</p><p>Children develop a real sense of belonging at the kindergarten. They develop a belief in themselves as capable, competent learners, and their emotional wellbeing and independence are strongly promoted. Children take the lead in their interactions with others. They engage in sustained and complex learning, often using computer technologies as tools for learning. Transition-to-school processes are managed well by the teachers, and positive relationships have been established with the neighbouring primary school.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is recorded in learning stories, and shared with parents and whƒÅnau both in portfolios and electronically on a web-based programme. This allows parents and whƒÅnau to share and celebrate their child‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Self-review processes are well developed, clear and purposeful. Information is gathered, many perspectives are sought and there is a strong focus on improving practice. Teachers use spontaneous and planned reflections to review the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The head teacher continues to build on the inclusive and positive practices, systems and processes that have been established. She fosters a collaborative approach to decision making and is highly supportive of all in the kindergarten community. The kindergarten continues to benefit from professional support and guidance of the education support manager and the association.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>ERO and the kindergarten leaders agree that a next step for the teachers is to strengthen the analysis of the evidence gathered from self review projects. This process should assist them to continually evaluate the extent to which intended goals have been met, and the quality of outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukete Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukete Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
