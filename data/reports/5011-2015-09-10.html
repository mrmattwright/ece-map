</table><p>With ongoing support from Northland Kindergarten Association, Hora Hora Kindergarten is well placed to address the key next steps identified in this report.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hora Hora Kindergarten provides six hour sessions for 40 children over the age of two years. The kindergarten operates with four full time registered teachers and one part time registered teacher. Families attending the kindergarten have a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. Children transition to many local schools.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is based on strong, welcoming relationships with families. It reflects teachers‚Äô commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It aspires to being inclusive and responsive towards families and their children.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2012 report noted children‚Äôs confidence in choosing their own play and working together as they engaged with the programme. There were positive and affirming relationships between children and teachers, and the programme was informed by children‚Äôs interests. Aspects for improvement in the 2012 report included teachers reviewing the role they have in extending children‚Äôs learning. The report also suggested that programme assessment and planning cycles, and self-review practices could improve.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides governance, leadership and policy frameworks to meet operational management expectations. Association personnel assist teachers to maintain good standards of health and safety and to improve the quality of educational programmes. The Association‚Äôs <em>P≈´manawatanga</em> Plan reflects a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and support for the development of bicultural practices across the organisation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers at Hora Hora Kindergarten provide programmes aimed at supporting children to have fun and enjoy the company of others as they play. To some extent the programme successfully promotes shared play and opportunities for conversations and collaboration. Children are settled and make choices about their play. They select from a good range of resources and activities provided to promote their learning. Teachers are now well placed to continue to develop teaching practices that support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed by teachers at the start of the day. Family members speak well of the teachers‚Äô inclusion of their families in the life of the centre. Parents contribute to and support the programme through their own skills and interests.</p><p>Teachers respond well to children‚Äôs play ideas, asking questions to promote answers about what children are doing and adding additional vocabulary. Where this happens, children are eager to play for long periods. Other children stay at activities for short periods. Teachers could support children to participate more fully in the programme. This would enable conversations that deepen children‚Äôs understanding and confidence in sharing their thinking and ideas about their play. Teachers have started to promote leadership for children in the programme.</p><p>Children demonstrate understanding of te reo MƒÅori and use words and phrases in their play. They also know greetings and words in home languages of other children. Children‚Äôs diverse cultures are respected and valued in resources that reflect their home environments. This cultural recognition, which teachers integrate thoughtfully, contributes to children‚Äôs positive settling.</p><p>Teachers analyse children‚Äôs learning in portfolios and show what is happening in the programme. Planning is based on what teachers know about children‚Äôs interests. Teachers should now ensure that assessment portfolios record children‚Äôs progress over time. They should also show the ways in which the programme responds to parents‚Äô aspirations for their children.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to share some tasks and leadership responsibilities. There is still a need to continue to build a collaborative team that can support the development of teaching strategies to benefit all children‚Äôs learning. The team intends to use appraisal systems more effectively to identify where teaching practices need strengthening.</p><p>The Northland Kindergarten Association provides effective governance for kindergartens. Its long-term direction focuses on making decisions to improve learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>good support and guidance from Association personnel to improve the quality of kindergarten programmes and teaching practice, particularly the development of bicultural practices and integration of <em>Te Ao MƒÅori</em> (the MƒÅori world) into programmes in meaningful ways for children</li>
<li>effective teacher appraisal and professional learning and development that contributes to improved teacher skills, knowledge and practice, especially in supporting children‚Äôs social competence and strengthening the quality of assessment documentation</li>
<li>significant investment in property and environment upgrades to promote children‚Äôs exploration and investigation</li>
<li>a focus on distributed leadership practices amongst kindergarten teaching teams to utilise teachers‚Äô individual and collective strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Association leaders are considering ways to enhance teacher appraisal processes and systems for self review. ERO recommends that the Association strengthens systems to ensure that all health and safety requirements are being implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and ERO agree that self review should be used to determine:</p><ul>
<li>how well their teaching strategies contribute to children‚Äôs engagement and learning</li>
<li>the purpose of mat times and children‚Äôs engagement at these times</li>
<li>how usefully the activities they provide support mixed age engagement of all children in the programme</li>
<li>how well directional and annual planning are linked and reflect team aspirations and philosophy</li>
<li>the approach the team will take to strengthen and improve the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO determined, in consultation with the Association Professional Practice Manager, that the Association should take urgent action and work with teachers to improve and strengthen programmes, teamwork and further developments at Hora Hora Kindergarten.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hora Hora Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice and safety the kindergarten should ensure that safety surfacing around the climbing frame is adequate and well maintained.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hora Hora Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
