</table><p>Teachers require support to build their capability and capacity to promote positive learning outcomes for all children. Guidelines and expectations for programme delivery should be made readily available and monitored by leaders.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Napier Central formerly operated as ABC Napier Central Tahi and Rua. Kidicorp took ownership of the centres in 2012 when they merged under one licence. Since then there have been changes in staffing and management structure, including Kidicorp's rebranding as BestStart Educare Ltd (BestStart) in 2015.</p><p>The service offers full day early childhood education and care for up to 45 children, from infancy to school age, in two adjacent premises. Of the 75 presently on roll, 18 children identify as MƒÅori and four as of Pacific heritage.</p><p>BestStart policies and procedures guide operation and provide business management services. A professional services manager provides support for curriculum development and delivery.</p><p>There have been significant changes in the teaching team since the July 2014 ERO report. A new head teacher for the over two room was appointed in February 2018 and a new head teacher for the under two room is being sought. A new centre manager was appointed in February 2018. During the onsite phase of the review, three teachers were new to the service and three were relievers.</p><p>The July 2014 ERO report identified a number of key next steps in relation to governance and management, self review, and assessment of children's learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>BestStart leaders have addressed the key next steps relating to governance and management. Assessment and planning for children's learning and internal evaluation remain areas requiring improvement.</p><p>A child-led programme fosters children's independence and self-help skills. Children freely access resources and the environment. Their achievements and progress are celebrated. The new teaching team has a focus on building relationships with families. This is in the early stages.</p><p>A calm, relaxed pace supports infants and toddlers to lead their learning. The environment encourages their exploration. Responsive care giving is evident.</p><p>Assessment and planning for children's learning requires strengthening. This was an area for development in the previous report. Leaders are taking steps to improve teachers' capability. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction, which should include a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>how well teachers are supporting individual children's learning, particularly in the over two area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the extent to which assessment practices are responsive to children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting consistency of practice across the teaching team.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some elements of a bicultural curriculum are evident. Children learn about te ao MƒÅori through resources and routines. Leaders recognise that teachers' bicultural practice requires strengthening. In addition, supporting teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of educational success for MƒÅori children is an important next step.</p><p>Recent professional development in relation to supporting Pacific children has prompted teacher reflection on how current practice can be improved. This is in the very early stages.</p><p>Teachers engage in children's play but at times opportunities to extend their thinking are missed. Improving consistency in supporting and enhancing children's learning experiences is needed. A key next step is to ensure that guidelines and strategies for expected programme delivery are readily available and clearly understood by all teachers. This includes revising the centre philosophy.</p><p>Children's transitions between the Tahi and Rua rooms are well supported. Teachers share useful information about individual children's needs. The centre follows the BestStart Be School Ready programme to support children and whƒÅnau for their move to school.</p><p>Internal evaluation requires improvement. This was a key next step in the previous report. Leaders recognise that a shared understanding of the process and value of internal evaluation has not yet developed across the teaching team. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for development are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation focused on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sharing expectations of teaching practice to promote consistency.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review, ERO has received an action plan from the service detailing how they intend to address these areas for improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Napier Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Napier Central will be within two years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>14 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
