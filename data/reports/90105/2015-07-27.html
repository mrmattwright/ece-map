</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Queenstown Preschool and Nursery is a community-based centre governed by a management committee made up of parents from the community. The centre provides education and care for 70 children. The centre manager, an assistant and three head teachers work together with the committee to manage the centre. Teachers work with the children in three rooms. The infants have their own area and outdoor play space. There is a head teacher in each room responsible for managing the children‚Äôs learning programmes.</p><p>At the time of the last ERO report in 2012, the centre operated under two licences. These have since been combined. The leadership team has made good progress with all the recommendations from the last ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children work and play in an environment that supports their learning. Teachers have a common understanding of the key things they want children to learn. They actively promote these in their daily practice. These priorities include social development and supporting children to be confident and capable life-long learners.</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on promoting children‚Äôs independence, self-help skills and leadership abilities. The teachers are skilled in supporting this learning. Children work confidently in small or larger groups with or without teacher support. They are confident to approach teachers to chat and ask for help knowing they will be responded to in an encouraging way. Children enjoy relationships with teachers that are positive, supportive and inclusive of their individual wants and needs. Families‚Äô home cultures and languages are valued and affirmed.</p><p>The centre staff have good relationships with parents and the community. Leaders and teachers use a variety of ways to keep families involved and to inform them of centre events and what children are learning and doing. Head teachers are currently discussing ways to improve how they gather and use parent and whƒÅnau perspectives and aspirations to shape centre programmes and practices.</p><p>Children have easy access to a wide and interesting range of high quality resources and stimulating activities and learning experiences. Teachers take care to arrange the environment so that it caters to individual children‚Äôs preferences and choices.</p><p>The programme includes:</p><ul>
<li>rich experiences around early literacy</li>
<li>a range of opportunities for imaginative and dramatic play</li>
<li>interesting, learning-focused excursions to explore the community and areas of local significance</li>
<li>challenging activities to support children‚Äôs physical development.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers effectively support infants and toddlers learning and development in a calm and nurturing environment. They are tuned into the children‚Äôs non-verbal cues and are responsive to their changing needs. A priority for teachers is to build a strong sense of belonging through secure relationships with children and their families. Teachers work with parents to ensure a strong link between home and centre routines.</p><p>The head teachers are committed and passionate about children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. They provide effective leadership for their teams. They have worked hard to establish assessment and planning systems focused on promoting each child‚Äôs individual learning journey. Records of children‚Äôs learning recognise their strengths, interests and dispositions, and highlights their progress over time.</p><p>The head teachers are focused on continually improving their own and the teachers‚Äô practice. They have a good understanding of effective self-review processes and practices. Reviews have resulted in some significant developments at the centre. All teachers participated in professional development on self review. The teachers‚Äô involvement in the centre‚Äôs review processes has encouraged discussions, changed practice and improved outcomes for the children.</p><p>The leadership team is aware of the centre‚Äôs strengths and where practices can be further developed. Leaders are working toward achieving consistency in the quality of assessment and planning to help build complexity to children‚Äôs learning. The next step is to tighten the current system to ensure all children are discussed and planned for regularly and that all parents are regularly consulted about their aspirations for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The managers and head teachers are committed to ongoing professional learning and development (PLD) and make good use of this. Teaching practice has been enhanced by recent PLD about intentional teaching. The next step is to make these improvements more consistently visible by being more specific about the learning intention, the teaching strategies used and the outcome for the child. The head teachers and managers also make effective use of opportunities for professional development to further develop their leadership skills.</p><p>Bicultural practices are being effectively developed. The leaders and teachers are in the process of receiving external support to build their understanding of MƒÅori perspectives and how these can be integrated into learning programmes and the centre‚Äôs daily practices.</p><p>A new appraisal system has been recently adopted. The appraisal process could be strengthened by including a formal observation component. The management committee has yet to review the effectiveness of the new process and needs to appoint an appropriate external appraiser for the manager.</p><p>The centre manager and parent committee have benefited from governance and management training. Useful strategic and annual plans have been developed.</p><p>They plan to continue receiving external support to further develop their understanding of roles and responsibilities and effective systems.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leadership team and teachers need to continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>consistent practices around assessment and planning</li>
<li>bicultural practice across the organisation</li>
<li>the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the management committee needs to:</p><ul>
<li>develop action planning to show how the individual priorities identified in the centre‚Äôs strategic goals will be achieved over time</li>
<li>ensure that progress with the above is monitored through regular reporting to the committee</li>
<li>align the centre‚Äôs philosophies, self review and professional development with the priorities in the strategic plan</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Queenstown Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the early childhood service management should strengthen risk management systems for excursions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Queenstown Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>27 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
