</table><p>Country Kids Early Learning Centre is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews of the Annabel’s Educare Ltd organisation.</p><p>Country Kids Early Learning Centre is one of seven centres owned and operated by Annabel’s Educare Ltd. The centre is located in Temuka and caters for children from birth to six years of age, who are from the surrounding districts.</p><p>The nursery and preschool children each have their own indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor areas provide natural, well resourced play spaces that encourage children to make close connections to the local farming community.</p><p>The majority of staff are registered early childhood teachers or training to become early childhood teachers. Many of the teachers have worked at Annabel’s for a number of years.</p><p>Annabel’s management framework for the centres and the high level of support that managers provide is helping ensure a high quality service for all children at the centre. Since the 2010 review, managers have improved assessment practices and made routines more flexible and child-centred. They have made improvements to the outdoor programme and are working on further developing the indoor environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The preschool children confidently and fully engage in their play. They are well supported by their teachers to explore, problem solve and use resources in a range of interesting ways to extend their learning. Literacy, numeracy, music and te reo Māori are meaningfully integrated into the programme.</p><p>Children work cooperatively and invite others to join their play. They have positive relationships with their teachers and are encouraged to respect and care for each other. Good relationships are evident between parents and teachers, and between teachers. Parents willingly spend time in the centre finding out about their child’s learning and sharing information with staff.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are happy and settled. Teachers nurture the children and have established close relationships with the families. The environment strongly reflects the close connections between children’s home and centre learning. The wide range of resources are well presented and encourage the young children to actively explore using all their senses.</p><p>Māori values form a significant part of the centre’s philosophy and are well integrated into all aspects of centre life. The strong emphasis on home and centre partnerships and closer ties with the wider community are clearly evident in the programme. The respectful and caring relationships support children in their learning and social development. Wall displays show the different ways teachers build children’s awareness of tikanga Māori. Children regularly revisit this learning and share it with their parents.</p><p>The curriculum leader and teachers have made good use of self review to improve transition procedures between the nursery and the preschool. The process is flexible and focuses on keeping children and parents well informed and involved. Introducing a key teacher for each child in the preschool, similarly in the nursery, is helping children and families to settle more easily into the preschool environment.</p><p>Annabel’s has a good process for assessment and planning for individual children. Teachers identify children’s interests and parents’ aspirations and clearly outline children’s progress in developing their interests.</p><p>Teachers have a good understanding of self review and are beginning to make effective use of planned reviews to continue to improve the programme and the quality of learning and teaching and the learning environment.</p><p>The managers provide effective leadership for the organisation and support for the centre’s curriculum leader. Teachers are actively encouraged to continue to develop their skills and knowledge. They take an active role in achieving the organisation’s vision for high quality education and care.</p><p>The organisation has a well-developed management framework that effectively guides the operation of the centres. The managers and teachers have recently developed key values and principles for the organisation. These values and beliefs are being linked to all aspects of centre operations to help to ensure Annabel’s high expectations for the centres are sustained and promoted by all staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and curriculum leader agree that they need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment practices by helping teachers to develop their analytical skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complete planned self reviews and evaluate how well the changes are improving learning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish good transition procedures with the local schools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen strategic planning so that it more clearly shows links to annual plans, self review and staff appraisal goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kids Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
