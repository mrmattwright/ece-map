</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>A1 Kids Childcare provides full day education and care for children from two years old to school age. The service is licensed for 39 children and is part of the Evolve group of centres. It operates within the management structure and policy framework of Evolve and a philosophy that fosters biculturalism and developing positive attitudes to learning in children.</p><p>The centre caters for a multicultural community and welcomes family involvement in the service. Parents and whānau are encouraged to be partners in their children's learning and to share their aspirations with teachers. In response to community needs, a van is provided to transport children to and from the centre. Teachers reflect families' cultural diversity and encourage children to respect the values and culture of others.</p><p>The centre manager, who was appointed in March 2015, and three of her staff are registered teachers. They are a relatively new team and still developing strategies to implement effective teaching practices. The team has an extended professional development programme scheduled for 2017 to strengthen their management of the programme for children. The manager has worked collaboratively with Evolve to improve the environment and to replenish resources in most play areas.</p><p>In 2013 ERO identified several positive features of the services and recommended improvements in relation to the management of the service, self review, consultation with families and the quality of the provision for children. While several changes and improvements have been made, further work is needed in most of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre. They have positive relationships with teachers and many are developing friendships with their peers. Children engage well with resources and cooperate well when playing together. They are encouraged to be self managing at snack and meal times and some are confidently developing leadership skills. Children benefit from opportunities to learn about their bicultural heritage and many can competently cite a brief pepeha. They enjoy frequent excursions into the community including regular visits to the library and the local rest home for the elderly.</p><p>Teachers consistently support children to engage with resources. They interact warmly with children and most use questions well to encourage ideas, engage children in conversations and foster their interests. Teachers could now more deliberately focus on deepening children's learning through their individual interests and the cultural knowledge they bring to the centre.</p><p>Teachers have begun to develop systems to guide the programme. They plan long term topics and share ideas about related resources and activities. Teachers informally discuss their knowledge of children and respond well to their emerging interests. Teachers are starting to take leadership responsibility for curriculum areas and are developing their skills to write more informative learning stories.</p><p>It may be useful for teachers to develop a shared understanding of the characteristics of effective teaching and leading so they could help each other to achieve these skills. A greater focus on integrating curriculum areas such as literacy, numeracy, science and technology could also help teachers to develop more complex learning experiences and provide meaningful contexts for enriching children's conversations.</p><p>The manager and teachers have created a welcoming environment. Recent improvements have included revitalised play areas and upgrading the outdoor space. While the playground is an attractive area, further development is needed to provide adequate physical challenges, especially to cater for the high proportion of boys enrolled in the centre.</p><p>The centre manager provides sound leadership for staff. She has created long term strategic and annual plans to guide centre development, begun staff appraisals and initiated internal evaluation processes. The centre is well supported by the Evolve area manager who visits often and provides guidance. As the leaders further streamline operational systems they recognise they could:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>annually develop strategies to implement long term goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish clear links between the management plans, appraisal goals and teachers' professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>develop centre specific procedures to enact the Evolve centre policies.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre and area managers agree that the key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using the scheduled professional development programme to improve planning, assessment and evaluation processes in order to enhance learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers becoming more deliberate in their teaching practices to provide more challenging learning experiences for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation processes to support more critical reflection on the quality of centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>continuing to develop biculturalism and teachers' knowledge of tikanga and te reo Māori. </li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Evolve management should consider a simpler format for area manager reports on centre visits. A framework that clearly identified and followed up actions for improvement would be a more transparent tool for quality assurance and a more explicit guide for centre managers to focus on priorities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of A1 Kids Care and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of A1 Kids Care and Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 December 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
