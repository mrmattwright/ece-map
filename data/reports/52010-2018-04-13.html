</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Halcombe Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association).</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide mixed age sessional education and care for 25 children, three sessions a week. This includes provision for 10 children up to the age of two. At the time of this review there were 24 children enrolled and seven identify as Māori.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation, of which Central Districts Association is part, is undergoing a significant restructure that includes amalgamating associations. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and others.</p><p>The federation philosophy, 'Whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together', is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together.  Alongside this, the centre philosophy fosters te ao Māori understandings.</p><p>Whānau and families are valued as the primary educators of their children. Curriculum planning and implementation is a shared responsibility. Each session is supported by a team of parent educators who hold Playcentre training certificates. An employed facilitator supports children and families on session.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report identified areas for development for the association and the playcentre. Areas included: promoting success for Māori children; strengthening adults' conversations to extend children's learning; and evaluative self review. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>The review was part of a cluster of 11 reviews in the Central Districts Playcentre Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is clearly evident in practice. Children engage with enthusiasm in learning experiences underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They settle into activities of interest, are confident to approach others and move freely throughout the centre. Children work well together. Tuakana teina relationships are evident.</p><p>A calm, positive tone is evident. Relationships are warm and affirming and assist children's and families' sense of belonging.  Children lead their learning, making choices which sustain their involvement in play.</p><p>Te ao Māori is planned for, celebrated and part of the centre programme. This includes making links to individual children's whakapapa. Te reo is effectively modelled by adults and responded to by children.</p><p>An assessment, planning and evaluation framework guides members well. A range of tools are purposefully used to foster and records children's learning experiences in literacy, mathematics and creative arts. Science and physical activities provide challenge and enjoyment. Centre excursions provide children with rich local experiences.</p><p>Curriculum planning is responsive to children's developing interests. Parents work with the goals, dispositions and learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki, </em>the early childhood curriculum. They write about these in children's learning plans and portfolios and share information so all adults can support the progress and learning of individuals. The online platform provides a useful communication link for parents and whānau contributions.</p><p>Children attend events at the local school. There is a positive transition from the centre to the school.</p><p>The facilitator is guiding members in setting up meaningful experiences for all children. Professional development is building members' understanding of internal evaluation. Members are aware of the need to further extend their practice and to further develop and use the processes for internal evaluation. A next step is to implement the appraisal process to assist the facilitator with her development.</p><p>Suitable planning priorities and objectives are incorporated into the centre's strategic and annual planning. Membership has recently increased, with a high number of new families joining.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>further developing understanding of effective internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>At the association/federation level, priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>regular, robust and consistent appraisal for all employees</li>
<li>centre support that is consistently effective in identifying and responding to playcentre needs</li>
<li>understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation</li>
<li>members' understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation  </h3><p>ERO recommends that the new regional team actively monitor and evaluate the quality of support provided to playcentres.<b> </b></p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Halcombe Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Halcombe Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>13 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
