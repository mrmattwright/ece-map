</table><p>The centre has not demonstrated its ability to sustain improvements over time. It requires further development in management and curriculum systems to promote improvement in the quality of the programme.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Three Bears New Lynn Childcare is located in a residential area of West Auckland. It is one of two centres operated by the owner in the local vicinity. Over the past three years the New Lynn centre has been completely rebuilt. It now has two main buildings ‚Äì one for the older children and one for the younger ones. The centre provides care and education for up to 40 children, including up to 18 under the age of two.</p><p>Centre staffing has continued to undergo change. The centre owner is the only teacher still at the centre from two years ago. Staff comprise two fully registered and two provisionally registered teachers. Adult-to-child ratios are better than minimum requirements.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs 2012 ERO report noted that children were well cared for and that relationships between teachers and children were positive. Teachers knew children and their families well and were responsive to children‚Äôs interests. These features have been sustained. The report also contained next steps required to strengthen the quality of teaching and learning, programme evaluations, teacher appraisal and bicultural practice in the centre. Although some progress has been made in these areas, the improvements are very new and, as yet, not embedded into centre practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a good sense of belonging. They have respectful relationships with teachers and enjoy special group times together. Affirming and encouraging practices result in gentle and calm transitions during session times. Children up to the age of two are settled and well cared for. The shared outdoor play area supports tuakana/teina relationships between younger and older children in the centre environment.</p><p>The centre complex provides good opportunities for children to engage with activities, be creative and engage in physical challenges. Teachers work alongside children helping them explore resources and join in cooperative play. Teachers now need to extend and enrich children‚Äôs learning. They also need to increase their support of the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum has clear links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A newly established planning process is visible for teachers and parents, encouraging them to contribute regularly. A new on-line programme supports communication with teachers, parents and whƒÅnau. Through self review, centre leaders have identified the need to improve:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to be active in the centre</li>
<li>assessment and programme evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><p>New systems for centre management have been recently established. A much needed strategic plan has been put in place and self-review practices extended. The manager and teachers are currently reviewing the centre philosophy and direction.</p><p>Staff have received some professional support to promote ongoing improvement. A new mentoring programme has been introduced to support the current practice of teacher reflection. It is important that this reflection continues as part of centre processes for enabling teachers to meet Education Council teacher registration requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre owner and manager agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>supporting teachers to extend and enrich the programme and children‚Äôs learning opportunities</li>
<li>developing bicultural practices throughout the centre</li>
<li>consolidating newly introduced processes, procedures and practices in order to improve centre operations and support centre sustainability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Three Bears New Lynn Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance in Three Bears New Lynn Childcare. To meet agreed accountabilities the service provider must ensure that there is an ongoing process of planning to help the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and to guide the centre‚Äôs operation.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 6, GMA 8.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Three Bears New Lynn Childcare will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>15 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
