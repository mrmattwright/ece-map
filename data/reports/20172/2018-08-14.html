</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Three Bears New Lynn Childcare is one of two centres owned and operated by the manager. It provides full-day education and care for children from two years to school age. The centre has 44 children on the roll. The other centre, Three Bears Titirangi, caters for children up to two years of age.</p><p>The philosophy of the centre is based around the teachings of Emmi Pikler and the Resources for Educarers (RIE) philosophy of respect, love and child-guided free play. The children are grouped according to age, but are able to move freely throughout the centre and play together outdoors. Teachers promote children as independent, capable self-directed learners and provide opportunities for uninterrupted play.</p><p>The centre caters for families from the surrounding suburbs, some of whom are from diverse cultures. The number of MƒÅori children attending the centre is small, and a smaller number have Pacific heritage. It is the aim of the staff to be inclusive and sensitive to cultural beliefs and values as part of practice.</p><p>The centre employs five qualified teachers, one teacher in training and additional support staff. The owner has recently employed an administrator to provide day-to-day support.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report found that there was a need for external support for the centre to move forward. A change in philosophical approaches and building of team understanding has resulted in a new direction and goals for the teaching team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, busy and trusting with teachers (kaiako) and each other. They and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed and show pleasure at being in the centre. Kaiako know children well and organise the environment to be inviting and familiar for them. The programme follows children's lead and is play-based. Children make good use of the resources and experiences available. Friendships between children are evident as they play. The philosophy is clearly evident in the programme.</p><p>Kaiako place a strong focus on children's wellbeing and comfort. Noise in the centre is kept low and children are encouraged to play peacefully together. The sense of calm and quiet modelled by kaiako has a very positive impact on children's sense of the centre as a pleasant, supportive place. Children are independent and clearly focused on their own learning within the group. Transitions are sensitively managed.</p><p>Relationships are a strength of the centre. Kaiako work well as a team, with consistent and well-considered ideas about their impact on children and families. Their belief that "relationships are all" has helped them to generate respectful, reciprocal and responsive interactions with families that encourage the sharing of information about children. Kaiako have a particular and successful focus on welcoming MƒÅori and Pacific whƒÅnau and learning about their aspirations for their children.</p><p>Kaiako expect that children will follow their own "biological urges" in their play and development. This is working effectively for most children. It would now be useful for kaiako to consider how well the programme is supporting and challenging those children nearing school age and to consider using more open-ended questioning, conversations and discussions around their interests.</p><p>Kaiako use te reo MƒÅori frequently and naturally as part of conversations with children. Children sing waiata with understanding and enjoyment. MƒÅori legends and stories form a regular part of mat time experiences. Kaiako understanding of Pacific languages and cultural knowledge is growing and they have identified both MƒÅori and Pacific cultural responsiveness as areas they intend to strengthen.</p><p>Kaiako use of internal evaluation to help in decision-making has greatly improved. Discussion about the new strategic plan has become a platform for strengthening all aspects of teaching and learning as well as team aspirations for the future. Further work could now streamline and clarify timelines and persons responsible for actions to make the plan even more effective. Policies and procedures for health and safety are in place.</p><p>The owner and kaiako are working together on a model of shared leadership and recognition of kaiako strengths and interests. Kaiako are confident and committed to the growth and development of the centre and its children. The owner's generosity in providing many opportunities for professional learning and development for kaiako has helped to develop strong partnerships and mutual understanding within the teaching team.</p><p>Management of the centre is efficient and regularly updated. The addition of the new administrator should assist the owner to further develop and refine established policies, procedures and operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager agrees that next steps for the centre include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepen internal evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching and learning and how to record and link this knowledge over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen understanding of bicultural and multicultural practices in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase ways parents/whƒÅnau can contribute to internal evaluation and policy review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to provide learning challenges for the older children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Three Bears New Lynn Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Three Bears New Lynn Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>14 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
