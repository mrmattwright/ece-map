</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Warkworth Kindergarten is located in the small rural community of Warkworth. The centre provides sessional and full day care for up to thirty five children from two and a half to five years of age. The centre operates in a purpose-built building that has continued to be modified to provide linked playing spaces for children.</p><p>The centre community includes children and whƒÅnau from a number of cultures. MƒÅori whƒÅnau are particularly well supported to feel comfortable in the centre and to contribute to the programme. All families are encouraged to share information to enable teachers to work effectively with children.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, the service provider has employed new staff. She continues to provide teachers with professional development to further embed understanding of Reggio Emilia aspects in the centre programme. Teachers use <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum to underpin te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori influences in teaching programmes.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report noted the centre‚Äôs good practices and effective teaching. The report recommended that teachers continue to develop assessment and planning processes and further embed understanding about the centre‚Äôs philosophy. The centre continues to provide good quality education and care for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident in the centre. They capably take ownership of and self-select their play. They are eager explorers of their environment. Children‚Äôs sense of well being and belonging is supported by the professional and warm relationships between teachers and families. As a result, children are calm and engaged in collaborative play.</p><p>Teachers provide positive opportunities for all children to understand the significance of MƒÅori as tangata whenua. Children benefit from the richness of their play environment. Teachers have created beautiful and interesting spaces for different types of play with a strong focus on MƒÅori art and design. Children treat the environment with respect and enjoy it.</p><p>Staff build meaningful partnerships with whƒÅnau and iwi within their community. The ideas of whƒÅnau, their aspirations for their children and their involvement in programmes helps teachers to confidently foster children‚Äôs understanding and learning about biculturalism.</p><p>Children respond positively to teachers‚Äô support for their play. Teachers‚Äô focus on aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophy includes prompting children‚Äôs thinking and interest in their own discoveries and explorations. Literacy and numeracy are included meaningfully in the programme. The emphasis on children feeling confident in all areas of their learning is helping to build up children‚Äôs readiness for school over time.</p><p>Management systems, policies and procedures are well developed and effectively used to operate the centre efficiently. The philosophical approach is a regular topic for review and discussions are shared between teachers, management and families. Teachers regularly record their observations about their own practice and are supported to attend professional development to continue their own professional growth.</p><p>Thorough self review processes guide ongoing improvement and reflection within the centre. Teachers‚Äô written documentation about the results of reviews helps them to revisit decision-making and further monitor change.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that the next steps are for teachers to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>further build bicultural practice and strengthen iwi connections</li>
<li>develop teachers‚Äô shared understanding of the approaches used to guide the programme and embed good practice to align with the centre vision</li>
<li>acknowledge parent and whƒÅnau aspirations and contributions in centre documentation</li>
<li>develop assessment processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Warkworth Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Warkworth Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
