</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Claudelands is located in the suburb of Claudelands, east of central Hamilton. This centre has renamed its learning spaces to represent the cultural heritage of the local hap≈´, NgƒÅti Wairere. ABC Claudelands provides education and care for children from 3 months to school age in two age-based learning environments. The centre provides a transport service to assist parents and whƒÅnau to access the centre. At the time of this ERO review, 47 children were enrolled, including 29 tamariki of MƒÅori descent. The roll for this centre includes a wide range of ethnicities, including Pacific children.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Best Start Educare limited that provides strategic direction, and policy guidelines and management services. Best Start Educare provide a professional services manager (PSM) and a business manager (BM) to support the centre team.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report identified bicultural development, improvements to the environment and planning and assessment practice as key next steps for the centre. The centre has responded positively and made good progress to these areas of development.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review a new centre manager, second in charge, and new teaching staff have been appointed. The majority of staff are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The centre has recently updated its philosophy. It is now based on the principles of whanaungatanga to reflect the value and significance of relationship building by teachers with tamariki, whƒÅnau, and their community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at this centre have many opportunities to explore in a safe, caring and increasingly natural and well-resourced environment. They benefit from tuakana-teina relationships that provide good opportunities for older and younger children to play and learn alongside each other. A special feature of this centre is the calm and settled atmosphere.¬†</p><p>Teachers have close and trusting bonds with tamariki and their whƒÅnau. They are highly responsive to the needs, strengths, interests and passions of tamariki. This results in children being very involved in sustained and meaningful play and learning. Children benefit from supportive and respectful relationships by teachers.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective. They understand the importance of self review and the impact this has on teaching and learning. Teacher capabilities and skills are well used. The opportunity to take responsibility and undertake leadership roles is provided. A wide range of effective and learning strategies are implemented. Children's growth and development is strengthened.</p><p>The centre's curriculum is responsive to whƒÅnau aspirations. Particular strengths of the programme are:</p><ul>
<li>the inclusion of tikanga MƒÅori and kawa that reflects the uniqueness of the centre and the area</li>
<li>the implementation of a project-approach that allows children to follow their interests and extend on these</li>
<li>the development of rich, spacious, play areas that reflect New Zealand's natural environment</li>
<li>effective integration of information and communication technologies within the programme</li>
<li>connections promoted through regular trips and visits into the local and wider community</li>
<li>transition into and out of the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Literacy and Mathematics are effectively integrated throughout the environment and in teachers' interactions with children. There is a strong focus on the development of children's oral language skills through conversations, storytelling, waiata, and small group experiences. Children are confident and communicate well with one another.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers implement very effective assessment, planning and evaluation practices. These practices are well used to inform teaching and enable teachers to provide a programme that is responsive to children's emerging interests. WhƒÅnau and tamariki have access to comprehensive individual portfolios that capture children's learning and development within the wide range of programmes provided. A recent initiative has been the development of online eLearning portfolios that support extended whƒÅnau to be involved in the learning of their tamariki and mokopuna.</p><p>The education and care needs of babies and toddlers are well met by knowledgeable and nurturing teachers. Children's individual care routines are sensitively managed. Close relationships are developed with whƒÅnau. Strong links are maintained between the centre and home. Young children develop friendships, experience challenges and opportunities to learn alongside their older siblings and peers.</p><p>The centre successfully reflects the philosophy in its practices. Whanau and staff reflect a good understanding of whanaungatanga and how this impacts on teaching, learning and the community. The programme is inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities. Regular visits to Hukanui marae occur and children participate in local kapahaka events. These are major features of the centre programme.</p><p>Self review is systematic, comprehensive and integrated across all areas of centre operations. Relevant professional learning and development is provided. Teacher capability is strengthened. Governance practice is effective and includes strong personnel management procedures and staff support. The centre is focussed on continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO acknowledges the progress the centre has made in relation to implementing an effective bicultural curriculum into the programme. To further develop and embed these values and principles the professional services manager, centre manager and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen their understandings of key concepts from Ministry of Education (MOE) documents: <em>Ka Hikitia, TƒÅtaiako</em>, and <em>Te Whatu P≈çkeka</em>. This should support staff to develop their knowledge and capability to continue to grow authentic cultural practices within the centre</li>
<li>increase the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices throughout the programme</li>
<li>include clear links to <em>TƒÅtaiako</em> in staff appraisals and performance management systems.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Claudelands completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Claudelands will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>30 March¬†</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
