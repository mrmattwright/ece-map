<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>ABC Claudelands is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children, with the support of the organisation managers.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>ABC Claudelands is an all day education and care centre in Hamilton East. The centre has undergone a change of ownership since the last ERO review in 2010 and is now owned by Kidicorp Ltd. The teaching staff has remained consistent over that time.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 44 children, including 11 under two years of age and has a current roll of 39. The centre is involved in the Participation Programme Initiative, and their van provides transport for families who need it.</p><p>Children learn and play in a spacious, attractive and well-resourced environment. Teachers have established strong relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau. Their interactions with children are deliberate and focussed on enabling children to learn from their play and exploration.</p><p>The centre is guided by a clear philosophy that promotes life-long learning through encouraging and supporting children to develop a healthy mind, body and spirit. The centre has a stable reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children at ABC Claudelands have opportunities to access a range of fun activities in both indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers establish warm, respectful relationships with children and know them well. Their interactions promote ongoing learning. They consistently use a range of positive strategies for developing social competence and conflict resolution. Infants and toddlers learn and play in a child-centred environment that has been specifically designed for them. It is quiet and relaxed, and teachers are responsive to individual routines and development. Children are well supported as they transition within the centre and on to school.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are integrated throughout centre activities. Teachers have a good understanding of the early childhood curriculum and are able to utilise their personal strengths to enrich children&rsquo;s learning experiences. They are developing knowledge of the diverse cultural identities of children in the centre, and are beginning to apply this understanding to enhance interactions with children. Children are encouraged to develop problem solving skills and become independent learners.</p><p>The centre utilises a range of effective strategies to communicate with parents and wh&#257;nau. Parents are well informed about their children&rsquo;s progress. The teaching team is cohesive and there is a strong commitment to shared leadership and ongoing improvement. Kidicorp managers are providing good quality support for centre staff. Kidicorp systems and policies, enhance the centre&rsquo;s ability to review and develop their programmes and practices. Teacher appraisal processes are robust and closely linked to professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that there are several important next steps to improving the promotion of positive outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>Kidicorp managers and teaching staff could broaden the curriculum, make greater use of the local community, and include parent and wh&#257;nau aspirations in the design of the programme</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s emerging interests would be further enhanced by more comprehensive planning that identifies and develops children&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and dispositions. This should lead to more specific and effective planning of the environment, teaching strategies and learning provocations</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s learning is documented in learning stories that are accessible to children and parents. These could be further enhanced by more consistently identifying possible next steps in learning, identifying progress over time, and linking these to wh&#257;nau aspirations</li>
<li>while the cultural background of M&#257;ori children at the centre is acknowledged, there is a need to increase the M&#257;ori content in the curriculum and to utilise a more bicultural perspective in learning stories.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Claudelands completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 March 2013</p><a id="4-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Pou Whakahaere</strong> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><strong>Pou &#256;rahi</strong> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
