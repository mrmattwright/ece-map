</table><p><strong>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</strong></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Magnolia Tree Childcare Centre is a recently established centre in Whatawhata, near Hamilton. The centre owners have developed spacious, well-designed, and maintained indoor and outdoor environments for the education and care of children. There is a separate area for children up to the age of two years. The centre received a full licence, from the Ministry of Education, at the beginning of 2014. They are licensed to cater for 57 children including 15 up to the age of two. At the time of this ERO review there were 87 children enrolled, including 23 identified as Māori of Tainui descent.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy places an emphasis on respectful interactions with people, places and things. It is centred on ten identified virtues expressed in te reo Māori and English. High value is placed on caring for Papatuanuku, sustainability of the natural world and the provision of high quality furniture, equipment and resources. Teachers are well qualified and many are experienced early childhood practitioners. Staff know the children and their families well and have purposefully nurtured a family, community atmosphere.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s interests and parent aspirations are placed at the heart of the curriculum. Teachers are skilled at engaging children in complex, in-depth learning experiences over time, including project work for older children. Children enjoy exploring, experimenting and experiencing challenge in an imaginatively presented and aesthetically pleasing environment. Teachers play alongside children in dramatic and creative play experiences. These promote children’s developing thinking, social and leadership skills.</p><p>Flexible routines enable children to sustain their play, resulting in complex learning and construction. Children in the older area demonstrate confidence and independence as they manage their own learning, make choices and enter into play.</p><p>Teachers have a good understanding of integrating early concepts of literacy and mathematics throughout the programme. They listen carefully to children’s ideas and questions, and make use of these when planning learning experiences. Children’s ongoing learning is enhanced by a love of reading and sharing stories, and using books and digital technology for research. They express themselves through language, construction and the creative arts.</p><p>An experienced kaiako shares her knowledge with teachers and children to build their skills and understanding of te ao Māori. The language, culture and identity of Māori tamariki is clearly evident in the programme and environment. This is contributing to a strong sense of belonging and success for tamariki and whānau. Teachers are finding out more about the local history and places of significance to Māori to enable them to include this information in the programme.</p><p>Active learners benefit from generous spaces to explore, and challenging, open-ended equipment to use in ways of their own choosing. Teachers have a good understanding of boys and provide experiences that respond to and enrich their learning. Children learn to care for centre pets and take part in gardening and other meaningful activities through the day. They are learning to respect and protect the environment.</p><p>Babies and toddlers experience a calm and unhurried environment for learning and care. Their well being and belonging is fostered by teachers who are sensitive and responsive to their needs, interests and strengths. Teachers’ rich conversations with children contribute to their developing language and communication skills. Children in this area benefit from having consistent care givers. This contributes to children developing their confidence and curiosity as they explore the environment. They freely access a good variety of appropriate and high quality materials and equipment. Parent partnerships and good communication systems and processes ensure continuity of care routines between home and the centre.</p><p>Transitions into the centre, between the age-based rooms and on to school, are well planned and managed at children’s own pace. Positive and meaningful relationships have been established with the nearby primary school.</p><p>The centre owner has established a well-qualified, professional team of teachers who share common values and beliefs about teaching and learning. This team have formed strong learning partnerships with families. High quality teaching practices include:</p><ul>
<li>enthusiastic, reflective teachers who willingly embrace and implement professional learning</li>
<li>a good understanding of the purpose and use of self review for ongoing centre development and improvement</li>
<li>regular meetings where teachers plan and evaluate children’s learning and development, and share this both formally and informally with families and whānau</li>
<li>a commitment to building teachers’ knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori and the cultures of families in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>The leadership team take shared responsibility for the management and smooth running of centre operations. There are clear and well-understood roles and responsibilities that recognise the strengths and ideas of each teacher, and foster emergent leadership. Leaders model good practice, set high expectations, provide timely and effective feedback to teachers, and high quality mentoring for provisionally registered teachers. In a relatively short time, the leadership team has established a culture of respect and inclusion for children, families and staff in the life of the centre.</p><p>Effective governance and management places the centre in a very good position to sustain its performance. This good practice is supported by:</p><ul>
<li>the shared vision and philosophy, which set a sound direction for the service</li>
<li>the dedication and commitment of the centre owners and their expertise in providing a service that is focused on positive outcomes for children and their parents and whānau</li>
<li>the director’s capability to recruit, manage and further develop competent teachers</li>
<li>well-managed finances that support centre priorities for the quality of learning and care</li>
<li>effective self-review processes that inform decision making and ongoing improvement in all aspects of centre operations.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Currently, strategic planning identifies a large number of goals for future development. As a result of recent professional development, the centre owner has realised the importance of strengthening strategic planning by linking goals to the centre philosophy, licensing criteria, self review and the performance management system. Ongoing review and fine tuning of the strategic plan is likely to result in more manageable and coherent guidelines for promoting progress and sustainable development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Magnolia Tree Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Magnolia Tree Childcare Centre will be in four years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>5 August 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
