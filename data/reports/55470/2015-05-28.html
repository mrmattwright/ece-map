</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PORSE Albany S1 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare. Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators to implement and support learning programmes for children in homes. PORSE also supports families and educators with professional development, administration and payroll services. A national team provides governance and management support for all PORSE services.</p>
<p>PORSE offers two models of education and care: the Home Educator model, where an educator works in their own home; and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works in a family‚Äôs home. PORSE provides a range of training programmes and workshops for home educators, nannies and parents. Of the 98 children enrolled in the network at the time of this ERO review, one identifies as MƒÅori.¬†</p>
<p>The PORSE vision is ‚Äòexpanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home‚Äô.</p>
<p>PORSE Albany S1 was previously known as PORSE North Shore S1.</p>
<p>This review is one of a cluster of nine home-based network reviews of PORSE In-Home Childcare.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Records show that the curriculum for children is based around their interests. Educators and programme tutors affirm the knowledge and experiences that children bring with them to the service. These experiences are acknowledged and provide a basis for decisions about the curriculum. Curriculum development around culture, language and identity is a key next step. PORSE acknowledges that building programme tutor capability in te ao MƒÅori, to support educators and children, is a priority.</p>
<p>Respectful relationships develop between educators, parents, families and whƒÅnau. These promote and support children‚Äôs sense of place. Information shows that educator input is valued by families. Programme journals demonstrate children have a strong sense of confidence, trust and connection with educators. Many parents affirm this through their communications with educators and programme tutors.</p>
<p>Children‚Äôs strengths and interests are sought from parents and whƒÅnau to inform continuity of learning. There is a balance of learning experiences in the home and outside at various venues. Parents‚Äô aspirations are well responded to. Observations of children in their everyday learning build a picture of what they are interested in, know, understand and can do.</p>
<p>Children with special needs and those with diverse needs are well supported to experience positive learning outcomes. Educators work alongside families, external agencies and programme tutors to provide support and assistance for children.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of opportunities for children to play and learn in larger groups. PORSE-organised playschools, music and movement, gymnastics, nature school, celebrations and excursions enrich children‚Äôs learning. There is a high focus on ensuring that children gain confidence in socially meaningful and relevant experiences in the community.</p>
<p>Programme tutors work positively to develop educators‚Äô assessment, planning and evaluation knowledge and understanding. They support and coach educators to build a range of approaches for different assessment purposes. Parents have opportunities to contribute to their child‚Äôs learning. The importance of identifying children‚Äôs progress, learning and next steps is a focus. PORSE acknowledges that assessment, planning and evaluation, and making links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are areas for ongoing development.</p>
<p>PORSE takes all steps to ensure environments are well resourced to cater for infants and toddlers. Many children in the network are aged up to two years. PORSE provides extensive resources to support educators to cater for infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô learning needs. Intentional planning is promoted in homes and playschools for these children. Adults value the importance of learning through play and recognise and use learning opportunities within established routines. Exploration and independence are supported and encouraged by adults.</p>
<p>Educators are well supported by programme tutors. They model and guide educators to be intentional and deliberate in their teaching.</p>
<p>A wide range of learning opportunities, documentation and systems supports educators and programme tutors to meet legislative requirements and PORSE expectations. Roles and responsibilities at various levels of the organisation are clearly defined. A supportive team culture is evident. Career pathways promote professional growth and reward study and achievement.</p>
<p>The programme tutors‚Äô performance management process incorporates links to professional teaching requirements. Appraisal includes regular constructive feedback linked to the personal and professional goals of individuals and strategic intent of PORSE. Systems to better monitor compliance with PORSE expectations are being considered.</p>
<p>PORSE values self review as a tool to promote improvement. Parents‚Äô and educators‚Äô views are regularly sought. Tools have been created and professional learning opportunities offered to support staff understanding. There is a need to further develop knowledge about, and use of, self review across the organisation. Using the existing framework in a more evaluative way to support decisions about development is an agreed next step.</p>
<p>A recent review has focused the PORSE vision and strategic intent on outcomes for children. PORSE should further explore this strategic priority to support evaluation of the quality of the outcomes and measurement of progress.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Priorities for the service are to continue to develop:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>educators‚Äô understanding and use of assessment, planning and evaluation as a basis for children‚Äôs programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems for monitoring that PORSE expectations are met for the implementation of staff appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Albany S1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of PORSE Albany S1 will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
