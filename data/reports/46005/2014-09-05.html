</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>WonderKids Learning Centre in East Tamaki provides full day and sessional education and care for up to 40 children over the age of two years. The centre opened in 2012 and this is its first ERO review. Children, families and staff have diverse cultural backgrounds and are reflective of their multicultural community.</p><p>WonderKids Learning Centre is a privately owned centre. The owner, who is a qualified early childhood teacher, is the centre manager and takes responsibility for day-to-day centre operations. She has prioritised building a professional team and ensuring a shared understanding of the centre philosophy. A head teacher has responsibility for care routines and programme implementation. The centre is preparing for a change in leadership, with the owner taking more of a supervisory role, and new people being appointed to the centre manager and head teacher roles.</p><p>The centre philosophy places importance on allowing children freedom to explore, contribute, and take risks within a nurturing environment. The centre promotes mixed-age play, allowing children to share their ideas and play freely with and alongside all age groups. Partnerships with family are valued. The philosophy also places priority on acknowledging and incorporating bicultural practices into the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The tone in the centre is calm and children settle quickly. They experience warm, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Teachers are accomplished at supporting and guiding children‚Äôs growing social understandings and competencies. Staff know the children and their families well and value their different cultural backgrounds. Good teacher communication with parents supports children in their learning and in their emotional, physical and social development. Children and staff display a strong sense of belonging and enjoyment in being at the centre.</p><p>Children receive high quality care. Throughout the centre teachers are attentive to children and practise respectful care routines. Transitions and routines are unhurried. The learning environment is inviting and responsive to children‚Äôs interests. Learning areas are well defined and are arranged to enable a flow of play between the indoor and outdoor environments. Children have easy access to resources and learning opportunities in all areas of play.</p><p>Children benefit from teachers‚Äô skill in providing a mixed-age programme. Children are highly engaged in their learning and play. Teachers allow children to direct and make decisions about their own play. Older children care for younger ones and act as good examples for younger children to follow. Adults and children work and play well together, and the programme has an easy flow.</p><p>Children have good quality opportunities for literacy and language development. Time is given for one-to-one communication between adults and children. Children confidently initiate conversations, and opportunities are provided for children to have sustained conversations and to ask questions. Children‚Äôs first language is valued and often used to support their learning. A necessary next step is for teachers to ensure their interactions with children extend the complexity of play, especially during spontaneous play times.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are promoted in children‚Äôs play throughout the programme. Teachers provide a short afternoon session to support the development of skills identified as useful for helping children to transition successfully to school. Staff are continuing to develop a greater understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and ways to foster bicultural practices.</p><p>Teachers plan and assess programmes based on children‚Äôs individual and group interests. Planning is used well to extend learning opportunities for children. Children contribute to the planning process. Teachers could further improve their evaluation of learning programmes, with a focus on the impact of teaching practices on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The owner provides good management systems and effective centre leadership that contributes to the smooth running of the centre and positive outcomes for children. The centre manager leads a capable teaching team. Together they have a common understanding of the high expectations required for their professional practice. Teachers are supported to build on and extend their practice through regular professional learning and development. All staff participate in an annual teacher appraisal process to further improve their practice. Centre leaders and staff have a good understanding of self review and use it to promote ongoing improvements in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps include teachers developing:</p><ul>
<li>a strategic approach to promoting Te Ao MƒÅori and a bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>inquiry approaches for teaching and learning that encourage teachers to reflect on their practice and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of WonderKids Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of WonderKids Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>5 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
