</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wonderkids Childcare &amp; Preschool is licensed for 45 children, including up to five aged under two years. Children attend either six hour or full day sessions.</p><p>The owner/director is responsible for overall management and governance, and the two head teachers for the day-to-day management. Four registered teachers are supported by relief and part time teachers, and a cook.</p><p>Children have opportunities to play together in mixed age groups. Older children can access a large outside area. There is a separate area for babies and toddlers to crawl, play and sleep. The centre philosophy focuses on supporting children's independence and leading their own learning.</p><p>Children and their parents have a variety of cultural backgrounds, with a large proportion being Chinese. Teachers also reflect some of the diverse cultures represented in the centre.</p><p>ERO's 2014 review identified areas of good practice that continue to be evident. ERO suggested that the centre should improve its bicultural practices, and this area has been addressed well.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre director and teachers use a variety of effective strategies that support children to settle well into the daily programme. Teachers value parents as partners in their child's learning and encourage their involvement in the programme. Specific areas are provided for parents and children to interact with each other, and develop a sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to develop inquiry learning skills. They skilfully prompt children to deepen their interests through rich questioning, and hands-on experiences. These good practices, more consistently implemented, would enhance the centre's child-led learning philosophy.</p><p>Children under the age of two years are well cared for. The centre's primary-caregiver practices benefit these children. The environment supports younger children's physical and emotional development, and teachers respond well to their non-verbal communication cues to meet their needs.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers work closely with parents to develop children's individual learning goals. They collaborate with external agencies when extra support and expertise is needed for individual children.</p><p>The centre director supports teachers to include aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the daily programme. Children readily participate in waiata, and respond positively to basic instruction in te reo MƒÅori. Children's home languages are valued and are used by teachers to build relationships, and develop children's confidence in learning English. Centre leaders plan to enhance their cultural responsiveness to support all children's sense of identity.</p><p>The curriculum provides opportunities for children to experience science, numeracy and literacy learning in their play. Teachers prioritise hands-on exploration, and learning based on children's current interests. Teachers could consider their role in extending children's use of literacy and numeracy in their play.</p><p>Teachers meet with parents formally once a year, and discuss parents' aspirations for their child's learning. They provide activities and resources to respond to children's interests and inquiries. It would be more useful for teachers to use children's individual goals and dispositions to guide their planning. Children's learning stories could more strongly reflect their ongoing progress in relation to these goals and dispositions.</p><p>Good governance and management processes guide the centre's operation. Internal evaluation is becoming established, and teachers use a useful format to guide this process. Teachers are becoming more reflective about the quality of their teaching practices. They could further evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching on outcomes for children, particularly practices used to extend children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director and head teachers agree that useful next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>developing consistency of teaching practices that promote child-led programmes, and extend children's learning</li>
<li>further enhancing the educational provision for children with Pacific heritage</li>
<li>strengthening teacher understanding of best practice for infants and toddlers as individual learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of WonderKids Childcare &amp; Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of WonderKids Childcare &amp; Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>4 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
