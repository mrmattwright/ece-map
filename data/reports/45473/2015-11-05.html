</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Titirangi Private Kindergarten Rural Campus is situated in Henderson Valley and provides flexible options, including full day sessions, for up to 39 children over two years of age. Teacher practice reflects the centre’s philosophy that children's “happiness, academic growth and behaviour results from them forming a positive self-image at an early age.”</p><p>Children have opportunities to interact with farm animals and play in spacious indoor and outdoor environments. They are well cared for and interact confidently and cooperatively with each other and adults.</p><p>The supportive and collaborative relationship between the experienced owners, centre management and teachers benefits centre operations. They have identified ways of including parent contributions and ideas more in decision making about the centre’s strategic direction.</p><p>The centre supervisor and teachers have developed systems to improve and sustain recommendations from the 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported by teachers to develop their social skills and interests. As a result of positive changes, children benefit from teachers who recognise and respond to incidental learning opportunities. This practice contributes to children settling well to their play and making friends. Children have opportunities to learn independently and collaboratively. They interact confidently with others in their play in an unhurried centre environment.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. Relationships between teachers and children, and between teachers and parents, are warm and respectful. Teachers help children to interact in caring ways and to develop empathy towards others. High teacher ratios provide very good opportunities for adults to interact with individual children and to support their learning. Children are encouraged to try new experiences and explore areas of play independently. They have meaningful opportunities to develop understandings about the natural environment.</p><p> Children’s transitions to and within the centre are well managed. Teachers are committed to helping children and families experience a seamless move to school. They are currently developing partnerships with local schools to help strengthen this important transition in children’s lives.</p><p>Programme planning and assessment has been refined since the 2012 ERO review in order to support each child in their growth and development. The supervisor has successfully promoted processes for recognising and responding to children’s learning dispositions. As a result of her leadership, there are some good examples of teachers extending individual children’s learning. These models of sustained, extended play provide a basis for further enhancing high quality teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Teachers meet to discuss daily observations of children's learning. This responsive approach to planning ensures that teachers support children's mathematical and literacy development. A next step for teachers in planning for children’s emerging interests is to consider ways of recording and sharing children’s ongoing learning and development. These records of learning could provide children and families with a means for revisiting learning.</p><p>Other features of effective teaching practice in the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>building on children’s ideas through in-depth discussions with children</li>
<li>engaging in child-initiated conversations about play and learning</li>
<li>displaying photographs and stories of children’s learning on centre walls that highlight <br> <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>In response to the 2012 ERO report, teachers have also explored ways to enhance the centre’s bicultural development to improve outcomes for Māori children. Staff have sought and used the knowledge of whānau of Māori children to support this development. Teachers’ use of te reo Māori has now been extended beyond mat times to the rest of the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the centre’s self-identified next steps for ongoing improvement. Its self-review processes could be used to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify centre management roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>align the centre’s strategic planning to better reflect teaching practice</li>
<li>provide whole-centre professional learning and development that is focused on strengthening planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>share with whānau ongoing written information about their children’s learning progress.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Titirangi Private Kindergarten - Rural Campus completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To further improve practice, ERO and centre leaders agree that staff should be supported to understand changes in legislation and licensing requirements that impact on their role of ensuring children’s safety.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Titirangi Private Kindergarten - Rural Campus will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer<br>Northern</p><p>5 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2  Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
