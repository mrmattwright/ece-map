</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 40 children over 2 years of age. At the time of this ERO review, there were 53 children enrolled, including 20 children who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy acknowledges tikanga MƒÅori and aims for teachers to develop meaningful, responsive, reciprocal relationships. Teachers are committed to extending children‚Äôs learning and ‚Äòpromoting social, emotional, academic and physical competencies‚Äô.</p><p>Teachers have had focused professional development in the areas for improvement identified in the 2012 ERO report. They have strengthened the use of dispositional language and the MƒÅori dimension in assessments and interactions with children. The team has refined self-review processes, but there remains a need to further enhance the quality and focus of teachers‚Äô reflections.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust‚Äôs strategic direction sets out the service‚Äôs vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust‚Äôs professional leaders monitor the kindergarten‚Äôs compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Children make choices, initiate learning experiences and engage in play for sustained periods of time. They set personal challenges and demonstrate independence and problem-solving skills. Children confidently seek adult assistance and manipulate the environment to support their learning. They play well with and alongside others, develop strong friendships, and there are caring relationships between older and younger children. Children have a strong sense of justice, fair play, and some demonstrate well-developed leadership skills. Children communicate effectively with adults and peers, and support the learning of others.</p><p>Children enjoy learning in a spacious, attractive environment. They have ready access to a wide range of high quality equipment, resources and materials. The environment is thoughtfully planned and presented to include spaces for quiet, active, individual and group play. It provides diverse opportunities for children to extend their physical abilities. Displays make aspects of the programme, including bicultural elements, visible to parents, and acknowledge the local community and tangata whenua.</p><p>Teachers have responsive, inclusive relationships with children, their parents and families. They skilfully foster the development of children‚Äôs social and oral language skills. Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong emphasis on the creative arts and child-initiated imaginative play</li>
<li>early literacy and numeracy skills integrated across all areas of the programme</li>
<li>the inclusion of te reo MƒÅori and participation in the annual Piako Cultural Festival</li>
<li>regular gymnastics sessions with an outside tutor, bush experiences and excursions in the local environment.</li>
</ul><p>Whole team professional development since the 2012 ERO review has had a positive impact on aspects of teaching practice and outcomes for children. It has led to increased emphasis on children exploring the natural environment. Teachers have developed effective and consistent practices for settling and guiding children. Leaders and teachers are committed to building on the progress made in bicultural practices. They have enhanced assessment practices and developed collaborative sharing of their knowledge about individual children. There is now a need for teachers to more effectively respond to children‚Äôs learning and interests.</p><p>Teachers keep families well informed about children‚Äôs learning and the programme, through informal discussions, written and digital portfolios, and centre displays. They warmly welcome children‚Äôs families and are readily available to share their development. Parents appreciate the advice teachers provide, and the opportunity to provide feedback about centre practice. Reciprocal relationships with local schools support children‚Äôs transition to the next stage of their education.</p><p>The professional leader provides ongoing, effective support and guidance to the head teacher and teachers. The experienced head teacher supports a collaborative team who share a common philosophy. She places a strong emphasis on building positive and respectful relationships with all members of the kindergarten community. Teachers and families appreciate her open and honest communication.</p><p>Leadership is shared in order to use the strengths and interests of teachers. Staff are involved in self review focused on ongoing improvement. The trust has undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal in consultation with teachers. This is enabling them to respond to the expectations of the Education Council and increase the depth of teachers' reflections about their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the professional leader and head teacher agree, that the key next steps for the teaching team are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop assessment, planning and teaching practices to more effectively respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests and add complexity to their learning</li>
<li>increase whƒÅnau participation in planning for their child‚Äôs learning and interests, and exploration of their language, culture and identity.</li>
</ul><p>There is a need to strengthen appraisal and teacher evaluation practices by:</p><ul>
<li>focussing teacher inquiries on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>identifying and evaluating specific improvements to teaching practices and outcomes for children</li>
<li>documenting constructive support and guidance for teachers about next steps for development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
