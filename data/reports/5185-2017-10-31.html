</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Laughton is located in a residential area of Taupō. It is licenced for 44 children from two years to school age and operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT). At the time of this review 51 children are enrolled and 24 identify as Māori.</p><p>Central Kids Kindergartens' philosophy aligns with the principles and strands of the early childhood education curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. The managerial and administrative support is provided by the head office team and includes aspects such as human resources, policy development, finance and cultural support. CNIKT provides significant professional learning and development for the early childhood education sector on a national basis.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy states that quality learning opportunities for children are best achieved where the foundation for children’s learning is play based in a resource rich environment and their preferences are respected so they are involved in decisions about their learning. Children are encouraged to be confident in their own culture and develop respect and understanding of other cultures, and the dual heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p>Since the 2013 review the kindergarten has undergone a complete refurbishment, moved to a six hour day model, including new teachers going from a three to a four teacher team.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of seven kindergartens reviewed in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported by high-quality teaching and learning experiences. Teachers know children well and what they bring with them to the service. Intentional teaching that extends and builds on learning, ensures equitable opportunities are available to all. Children's critical and high level thinking such as problem solving, imagination, and creativity is strongly fostered through exploration. Teachers' reflective practice supports acknowledgement of children’s passions, patterns and how to extend these. Children are encouraged to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>Relationships between teachers, children and their parents are strongly focussed on trust and respect. Teachers work in partnerships with parents and children to personalise, improve and enhance children’s learning. Children are effectively guided through coaching which supports communication and social competence. They are encouraged to take responsibility for people, places and resources. Transition into and out of the service follows a strong process that promotes children’s sense of self worth and belonging. Trips and excursions are a feature of the programme, as children connect with the wider community where they experience intergenerational learning at the nearby St John's Wood Retirement Village, and physical movement at the local gym, and horse riding.</p><p>Children experience a rich, authentic and highly responsive curriculum. It strongly reflects their culture, family, interests, strengths and needs. Children direct their own learning, making decisions and choices that build and promote self responsibility. Literacy and numeracy are continually promoted throughout the environment. Assessment effectively identifies children's interests, strengths and sense of their own identity. Progress of learning over time is evident and built on. There are many opportunities for children to be engaged in meaningful learning.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by the concepts of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and all aspects of kaitiakitanga. The curriculum enhances the mana wairua of Māori children validating their ways of knowing, being and doing, underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Teacher’s knowledge of Te ao Māori, including waiata, karakia, and cultural responsiveness is strong and effectively supports children to develop an understanding of the bicultural nature of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p>Internal evaluation follows inquiry and action research that focusses on change and improvement. This is supporting ongoing improvement to systems processes and practices throughout the kindergarten. Teachers' appraisal goals and inquiry are embedded throughout the service through internal evaluation. This supports them to identify areas of personal learning that impacts on their practice in order to grow their capability and capacity. Teachers' reflective practice is contributing to ongoing positive learning experiences for children.</p><p>Leadership is highly effective in promoting positive outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers show a strong commitment to the goals and vision of the service. Leadership is collaborative and strengths within the teaching team are utilised, valued and celebrated. The high level of professional trust in the team has resulted in reflective and high-quality teaching practices. Children benefit from leadership that places them at the forefront of decision making.</p><p>CNIKT provides effective governance. The kindergarten is effectively supported by a professional leader. She provides regular and detailed reporting and feedback to the head teacher and teaching teams. This supports the centre to meet legislative requirements, and to ensure that this practise aligns with the CNIKT philosophy. The organisation has created comprehensive systems and processes that effectively promote positive outcomes for all children. The trust has a strong commitment to empowering emerging leaders and also provides generous professional development for teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has confidence that kindergarten leaders and the teaching team have the systems and capability to identify, progress and sustain high-quality practices and programmes. Robust and evidence-based internal evaluation, ensures the teaching team have a strategic and reflective approach to kindergarten development. This is clearly linked to community aspirations, research, current theories and teaching practice in early childhood education.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Laughton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p></p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Laughton will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>31 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
