<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2>
</div><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Ilam is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.<b></b></p><h3>Context<strong></strong></h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administer 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager (ESM) works with each kindergarten, giving feedback and professional support. Since the 2007 ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Ilam, there have been changes to operational hours and staffing. The kindergarten has also been relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood) Regulations 2008. All teachers employed by Kidsfirst Kindergartens are registered and fully qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Teachers are focused on making ongoing improvements and achieving positive outcomes for children and their families. They make good use of the attractive, spacious and natural environment to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in <b>nine</b> early childhood education services within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children and teachers experience high levels of manaakitanga (nurturing and respect) in the kindergarten. Children enjoy positive and respectful relationships with their teachers and other children.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and families. An atmosphere of whanaungatanga (positive, family-like relationships) builds on all children&rsquo;s confidence and helps to give them a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers actively foster an inclusive environment for children with diverse learning needs. &nbsp;</p><p>Families from a wide variety of cultures are welcomed and well supported by teachers. The environment has many displays that represent and show value to families&rsquo; cultures. Children who do not have English as a first language are well integrated into the learning programme. Teachers value the information parents share about children&rsquo;s home languages and cultures. They help children to develop English language skills through sensitive and informed interactions. The learning environment has prominent displays and learning resources that suitably recognise the diverse cultures of children and families.</p><p>Teachers actively foster partnerships in learning with parents. Parents are confident to talk with teachers, making good links between home and kindergarten. Teachers make purposeful and continual links to parent aspirations for their children in planning for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Key features of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on supporting children&rsquo;s learning about the use of technology</li>
<li>promoting healthy living and children&rsquo;s awareness of the environment</li>
<li>providing an environment that supports literacy, including M&#257;ori literacy, through regular use of the M&#257;ori language, waiata, and visual displays.</li>
</ul><p>Children have good opportunities to follow their play interests. Routines are well planned so that children can have substantial periods of uninterrupted play. This is helping them get more involved in their play and build on their learning.</p><p>Teachers communicate well and work effectively with one another. They regularly share useful information about children in the programme as well as teaching ideas. They appreciate and make good use of each other&rsquo;s strengths to extend the opportunities they provide for children.</p><p>Teachers keep useful and meaningful records of children&rsquo;s learning. These records show teachers are skilled at recognising and highlighting individual children&rsquo;s interests and learning. They respond to, and promote, children&rsquo;s learning needs in a range of effective ways.</p><p>Teachers respect children as capable learners and communicators. They involve children in purposeful conversations, about their work and ideas. Teachers use a range of strategies to help children think more deeply about their learning and build on their understandings, theories and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Teachers use purposeful self review to reflect on and strengthen the programme and practices. These improvements are being well led by the head teacher. She places a strong emphasis on encouraging professional discussion and using research. Teachers make good use of well targeted professional development to strengthen teaching and learning practice.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association has a well developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long-term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work of the kindergarten by the ESM and head teacher. Kidsfirst managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Areas for development and review</p><p>Teachers have reliably identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps in order to sustain and build on good practices are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build on recently introduced practices in programme planning and self review</li>
<li>foster stronger links with local primary schools that children are likely to attend.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements<strong></strong></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Ilam completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Graham Randell<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Southern Region</p><p>8 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
