</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Days Childcare Ltd provides a home-based childcare service for 34 children from birth-to-school age. The owner/manager is a fully qualified early childhood teacher, and is also one of two visiting teachers supporting nine in-home educators. Each educator has up to four pre-school children in their care.</p><p>The philosophy shows that respectful relationships are the key to children developing their own understandings of how the world works. Home-based care understands and values the home setting where everyday life experiences provide opportunities for play and learning.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, the manager has developed an action plan to show what she needed to improve and how she would go about this. Evidence shows that ERO's recommendations have been worked on and that some aspects are still work in progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>This service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for the children. The owner and visiting teacher effectively support educators to provide interesting programmes for children in partnership with parents and whānau.</p><p>Children play and learn in homes where they bond with and are cared for by a primary carer. This provides them with continuity, stability and security, especially for those under two years. Careful placement of children with the educator ensures siblings are kept together. This process also supports children's successful transition to school by providing continuity with after-school care.</p><p>Educators and visiting teachers know children and their families very well. There are strong connections with the child's home life. This family-like environment enables children's rhythms and routines to be followed, such as sleep and meal times. Educators form close connections with children's families and work in partnership to ensure the development of the whole child. Children's learning and developmental milestones are shared and celebrated.</p><p>Children take part in a wide range of learning experiences. They regularly meet with other children in other educators' homes (House hops), attend music groups, gym and go on frequent excursions within the community. Educators support children's learning through play and planned activities informed by Te Whāriki - the early childhood curriculum. They identify and follow children's strengths, interests and parents' wishes for their child's development.</p><p>Educators and visiting teachers are placing an increased focus on systematically including Māori perspectives (language, culture, identity) in their everyday programmes, so that Māori children feel proud of their identity.</p><p>Visiting teachers regularly and sensitively coach educators to grow their professional knowledge and practices. Their visits contribute to a useful appraisal process which supports the ongoing growth and development of the educators. They also keep consistent oversight on the wellbeing of educators and children, and requirements to ensure health and safety.</p><p>Visiting teachers model a range of different strategies and approaches to enhance learning and support educators to show children's progress through planning and assessment. They help educators to identify and understand children's capabilities and where they may need additional support. As part of this process external expertise is accessed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified the key next steps for the owner/manager and visiting teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>improve their understanding of internal evaluation and use a framework that will systematically support robust review</li>
<li>show more clearly the priorities/goals in the strategic and annual plans in order to guide future direction of the service</li>
<li>provide educators with better guidelines for planning and assessment</li>
<li>more clearly define the unique point of difference offered by home-based care and education, and those things that matter most for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Days Childcare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Days Childcare Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>18 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
