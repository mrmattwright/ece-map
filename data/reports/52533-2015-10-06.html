</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Linton Camp Childcare Centre Ltd is a privately owned service situated within the confines of Linton Military Camp near Palmerston North. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 58 children, including 25 aged up to two years. Most children attending are those of New Zealand Defence Force personnel. Currently there are 27 MƒÅori children on the roll.</p><p>Since the December 2012 ERO report, the centre‚Äôs building and outdoor play area have been extended and redeveloped. Improvements have resulted in a well-planned and presented environment that is a source of pride for children and adults. The manager and the teaching team promote high quality teaching, learning and care through regular review and strong leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme for children is strongly underpinned by respect and empowerment and enables teachers to nurture and build positive, trusting relationships with learners and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to the interests of infants, toddlers and young children. Constancy of caregiver supports infants and toddlers to develop strong and secure attachments. Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace in which these younger children have space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Deliberate teaching strategies successfully guide and build children‚Äôs developing competencies. Teachers capture each child‚Äôs development through regular and useful assessment. They have an understanding of each child as a unique participant in the centre‚Äôs learning community. Parents value sharing in and responding to their child‚Äôs on-line assessment information. Responsive teachers support children‚Äôs social and emotional progress.</p><p>Children are confident and active participants in learning. They make choices about play and set challenges for themselves. Children initiate interactions and conversations with their peers and adults. They develop cooperative relationships through regular engagement with others and are competent and enthusiastic learners.</p><p>Well-designed and resourced environments invite children‚Äôs participation in a wide range of learning opportunities. Rich experiences increase their understanding of reading, writing and mathematics and are successfully included in programmes in meaningful ways. Active exploration is stimulated and encouraged. They demonstrate positive attitudes and take increased responsibility for their own learning.</p><p>In collaboration with management and teachers, MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau are leaders in bicultural learning at the centre. Their language, culture and identities have a special place in the environment and programme. Bicultural practice is woven throughout the day's programme.</p><p>Te¬†reo¬†MƒÅori is naturally incorporated into conversations with children. Teachers are investigating further ways to promote te ao MƒÅori in a more local, place-based context. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><p>Children with special needs take part in an inclusive programme. Adults assist them understand their strengths and the challenges they face. When required, outside expertise supports parents, children and teachers.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with parents and whƒÅnau to support children‚Äôs seamless transition into the centre, within the centre and to school. Continuity between home, centre and school is seen by the centre as vital to children's developing confidence, competence and capabilities that transfer to the classroom.</p><p>Centre teachers and parents share information with new entrant teacher. Reciprocal visits are scheduled by the centre and school. Teachers continue to seek ways to strengthen this relationship.</p><p>Leadership is collaborative and improvement focused. The experienced owner/manager has a clear vision for the centre that is well communicated.</p><p>The teaching team has developed a culture, based on mutual respect and skills, that successfully encourages children‚Äôs learning. Teachers engage each other in purposeful learning conversations. They effectively use evaluation and robust self review to sustain and improve outcomes for children. WhƒÅnau and parents‚Äô hopes and values are part of decision making.</p><p>Self review and inquiry is embedded in centre practice and results in positive change for children and their families. The centre has a high quality, well-developed self-review process linked to core documents and the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Management and teachers are focused on building and strengthening self review by continuing to build capabilities within the team. ERO agrees that using the centre‚Äôs high quality review process to evaluate all aspects of teaching and learning should continue to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Linton Camp Childcare Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Linton Camp Childcare Centre Ltd will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
