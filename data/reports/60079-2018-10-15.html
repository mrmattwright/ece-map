</table><p>The service needs to develop and embed sustainable systems to support ongoing improvements in the curriculum and consistent teaching practices to promote better learning opportunities for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Castle Kids Nursery is one of four Christian-based centres in Waikanae under common ownership. The service provides education and care for up to 28 children up to the age of three. Of the 24 children currently enrolled, four are MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre philosophy is aligned to the Castle Kids organisation and its Christian values. It emphasises the importance of empowering children, exploration, respect and partnerships with whƒÅnau to support children's development.</p><p>A management team has responsibility for governance, management and ongoing operation of the organisation. Day-to-day management of the centre is the responsibility of the centre supervisor, with support from a senior staff member. Most teachers are fully qualified and staffing has remained stable since the September 2015 ERO report.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that management should continue to develop the new appraisal system to include specific goals, targeted observation and feedback about practice to support improved outcomes for children. In addition, improving evaluation capability to consider the impact of the learning programme for children was a key next step. Sufficient progress is yet to be made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have access to a well-resourced environment where their independence is encouraged. There are comfortable spaces that cater for infants and toddlers who are not yet mobile. Teachers effectively respond to the non-verbal cues of these young learners. A large inviting outdoor area provides active exploration opportunities for mobile children.</p><p>A suitable balance of teacher and child-led activities provides opportunities for children to explore and investigate. They are given space and time to problem-solve and take appropriate risks. Staff identify children who require additional learning support and work closely with parents and external agencies as needed.</p><p>The centre philosophy aligns to Castle Kids overarching mission and Christian values. It is now timely for teachers to establish clear indicators of practice that reflects the service's valued outcomes for children's learning. Developing an appropriate social competence procedure that clearly describes appropriate teaching strategies for infants and toddlers should be considered as part of this process.</p><p>A carefully considered transition process into the service facilitates the building of relationships with parents, families and their children. Daily communication books enable the sharing of information between home and service. A clear focus on promoting the wellbeing and sense of belonging of children is evident. Continuing to strengthen learning centred partnerships should further promote appropriate responses to support ongoing learning.</p><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of effective strategies to promote successful outcomes for MƒÅori children. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are visible within the environment. Further strengthening leaders' and teachers' understanding and use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> to improve the implementation of culturally responsive practice, is a key next step.</p><p>The new assessment, planning and evaluation process is yet to be fully implemented. Further development is required to include explicit planning that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identifies and extends individual children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently responds to children's culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluates the effectiveness of plans to progress learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Understanding and use of self review is emerging. A next step is to establish shared understanding of effective internal evaluation focused on improvement. Identification of high quality outcomes, linked to service priorities, should better support decision making.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report, many of the policies and processes of Castle Kids have undergone significant review with the aid of external support. Processes and practices that foster ongoing improvement and consistency across the organisation require further strengthening. ERO's external evaluation identifies this is a priority. In particular, governors and managers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisit strategic planning to better define goals, actions and desired outcomes for children to support alignment of key development processes in centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels of the organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen leadership and guidance to build teachers' understanding of high quality practice within the context of each service.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Further support is required to develop teacher practice. The recently revised appraisal system is yet to be fully implemented. Strengthening is necessary to ensure meaningful development of teachers, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formation of actionable, specific goals aligned to service priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formal observation of teacher practice in relation to goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of evidence to demonstrate how changes in teaching practice improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identification of relevant professional learning to more effectively meet teachers' identified needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities at centre level are to continue to strengthen and further develop:</p><ul>
<li>clear expectations to promote consistent teaching practices that reflects the service's identified valued outcomes for children</li>
<li>
<p>effective planning and evaluation of learning for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies that promote educational success for MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>culturally responsive teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At governance level, priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve the strategic planning framework to promote sustainability of operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen leadership and guidance to develop consistent teacher practice to promote positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement effective teacher appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Castle Kids Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The service provider must implement a formal annual appraisal of the service manager that meets Education Council requirements. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure regular review and analysis of accidents are undertaken to inform hazard management</p>
</li>
<li>develop collaborative understanding and use of self review and evaluation to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>
<p>further develop positive guidance procedures that support young children's developing social competencies within the context of this service, to promote consistency of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of this review, the service has provided additional evidence that shows the development of a form to regularly analyse accidents.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Castle Kids Nursery will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>15 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
