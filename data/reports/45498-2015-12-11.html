</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Flying Turtles Preschool is located in Pukekohe and provides full day care and education for up to 50 children from four to six years old. The centre is one of three operated by the owner. The other two centres which are nearby cater for younger children. As a group, the centres have made strong links with the community, and teachers have established positive relationships with families who often transition their children between the centres.</p><p>The owner administers the service and employs a centre manager to oversee the teaching practices in all three centres. They work with the supervisor of each centre to form the management team. At Flying Turtles, most teachers are fully registered and have been in the centre since it opened in 2010. They have recently reviewed the centre philosophy and confirmed their commitment to prepare children for lifelong learning.</p><p>The centre was first reviewed in 2012. At that time ERO identified the quality of learning experiences, the environment and caring relationships as strengths of the service. Teachers supported learning well and children were highly engaged in play. These strengths continue to be features of the programme and teachers have implemented their plan to improve self-review. They continue to develop their skills in te reo and knowledge of tikanga Māori.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic, independent learners. They quickly connect with teachers and friends on arrival and promptly engage in areas of interest. Children work well in collaborative groups often sustaining their play for prolonged periods. They confidently participate in interactive experiences on the mat and capably talk about their learning. Children benefit from literacy and numeracy experiences that are integrated in playful contexts and encourage them to write and use letters and numbers for real purposes. Opportunities children have to engage in ongoing projects, research and inquiry provide them with sound preparation for school.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations that children will be independent learners. They trust children to make choices and investigate their own creative ideas. There are also good examples of teachers supporting children's learning with open questions and prompts for further exploration. Teachers value children's contributions, often documenting their narratives and brainstorming with them to develop projects.</p><p>Teachers develop rich, interesting programmes that include many excursions, specialist activities such as swimming and dancing and celebrations of cultural events. Older children participate in more formalised literacy learning opportunities as part of a broad, play based programme.</p><p>Teachers are currently reviewing their planning to focus more on children's individualised learning interests. This initiative should enable teachers to strengthen links between learning stories and enhance their assessment of each child’s progress. The programme reflects aspects of biculturalism through resources, displays, use of waiata and some integrated te reo Māori.</p><p>Managers and teachers have established a very attractive and accessible learning environment. Good quality resources and physical play equipment invite children to engage in challenging tasks and work cooperatively with others. Spacious play areas support meaningful learning and enable children to develop imaginative scenarios that foster their thinking, language development and social skills.</p><p>Parents speak highly of the centre. They emphasise the quality of the programme, their relationships with teachers and the opportunities for their children to become independent. They also appreciate how well their children are prepared for school. Families are kept very well informed about centre events and their children’s learning, and are consulted during reviews of policy and practices. Parents are increasingly using digital tools to access and comment on records of their children's learning and to communicate with teachers.</p><p>The owner is an experienced manager who leads an effective management team. A clear strategic plan underpins annual operations and teachers’ appraisal goals. Self-review processes are sound and are focused on positive outcomes for children. Managers have a strong commitment to developing staff through ongoing professional development and by distributing leadership opportunities. Leaders continue to forge relationships with the community and actively engage with many schools to enhance the quality of transitions for children. Managers have attended training to improve the effectiveness of the centre appraisal process and procedures for endorsing teachers’ practising certificates. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders acknowledge that next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to enhance teachers’ use of te reo Māori and their understanding of tikanga as it pertains to their centre and the local area</li>
<li>refining teacher appraisal processes to strengthen evidence for meeting the practising teachers criteria, and establishing an appraisal policy.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Flying Turtles Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices centre managers should ensure arrangements for sleeping or resting children meet licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Flying Turtles Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 December 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
