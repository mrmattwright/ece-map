</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Palmerston North is a joint partnership between Lollipops Educare Ltd and the licensee. It is part of a wider network of similar services. This centre provides an education and care programme for fifty children from birth to five years of age. The centre offers five all-day sessions in purpose-built premises designed to suit three different age groups. Dedicated sleep rooms ensure that play does not have to be interrupted.</p><p>The centre director and supervisor have been in their positions since 2010. They work collaboratively to provide effective centre management and professional leadership for nine educators. These include two team leaders and, at the time of this review, four being mentored for registration. They are all supported by the national support manager who provides feedback, advice and guidance, particularly on teaching and learning and curriculum. Staff use standard company systems and polices. Planning and decision-making are local to meet centre needs and characteristics. The supervisor provides targeted and responsive staff professional support, especially for new and trainee staff and team leaders.</p><p>The philosophy focuses on respectful relationships between educators and whƒÅnau, and between educators and children. The service places emphasis on providing healthy meals for children. Recent self review has focused on developing the natural outdoor environment. The majority of families have an association with the nearby Linton Army Camp. It is important to this centre that they offer a secure environment for children where parents may be temporarily absent.</p><p>This was one of two Palmerston North based Lollipops Education and Care Services reviewed at this time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders show a strong commitment to the centre vision, philosophy and annual priorities.</p><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in a culturally inclusive environment. Primary caregivers assist infants and toddlers to gain a sense of security. Self management and independent decision-making are encouraged and evident. Children are treated as competent learners.</p><p>Educators actively promote positive behaviours through their calm, caring and respectful interactions with children. Children are friendly and confident when interacting with adults.</p><p>Transitions between rooms are well-considered. These are determined by the child's readiness, and in consultation with families/whƒÅnau. Tuakana teina relationships are apparent as children show care for one another, especially when they meet together as a whole centre.</p><p>Purpose-built environments are vibrant and inviting for children learning through play. The use of plants and natural materials promotes investigation and reflects the centre philosophy and values of sustainability. Pictures and photographs displayed at child level allow revisiting and reinforcement of learning through conversation. Children‚Äôs creative work is respectfully displayed and reflects the current programme.</p><p>Room-based curriculum design is clear and visible in wall displays. It builds on children‚Äôs interests and the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Opportunities to develop literacy and numeracy are well integrated into play. Older children are consulted in the planning process.</p><p>Excursions into the wider community enrich children‚Äôs experiences and extend current interests. A special feature of children‚Äôs learning is the introduction and use of sign language across the centre. This increases opportunities for communication with non-verbal children.</p><p>Learning stories in children‚Äôs portfolio books show continuity in learning and demonstrate children‚Äôs progress in a range of contexts. These identify children‚Äôs participation in the programme, capture significant moments and special events, and record their interests and learning. They are especially valued by older children. High quality assessment and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning informs parents and teachers of children‚Äôs development as learners.</p><p>A high level of commitment to supporting bicultural practice is evident. Bicultural perspectives and values are evident in the environment and daily routines. A next step is to continue supporting all staff to develop their confidence and capability in te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>The staff bring diverse skills, knowledge and cultural perspectives to supporting children from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities. They contribute to a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>Effective leadership and supervision supports and extends ongoing improvement. Leaders focus on raising the quality of education and care through regular self review of programmes and practices. A culture of reflection, inquiry and responsiveness underpins continuing improvement. The supervisor sets high expectations for practices in the centre. Centre-wide reviews and smaller scale action planned reviews effectively provide strategies for monitoring, maintaining and improving outcomes for children. ERO affirms the need for centre leaders to model and sustain evaluative self review.</p><p>A welcoming atmosphere and strong communication strengthen partnership with parents and whƒÅnau. Parents have opportunities for useful exchange of information through evaluations of learning and parent/educator interviews. Parents are surveyed for their feedback as part of the centre review process.</p><p>All educators have good access to responsive and targeted professional learning and development opportunities. These are closely aligned to the centre‚Äôs vision, philosophy and annual priorities. Emergent leadership is strong in this organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A planned appraisal process provided by the organisation is in place. It demonstrates good educator reflection and constructive feedback on performance from multiple sources. The process should be strengthened as a tool for improving individual capability and performance against centre expectations.</p><p>A strengthened appraisal process should incorporate the following components:</p><ul>
<li>linking performance from one year to the next</li>
<li>individual goals being more specific and measurable</li>
<li>reflecting and evaluating the progress against set goals</li>
<li>observations and feedback conversations being better documented.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Palmerston North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Palmerston North will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>6 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
