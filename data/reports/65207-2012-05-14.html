<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Granity/Ngakawau Playcentre is one of nine playcentres that are supported by the Buller Westland Playcentre Association. The playcentre is open for three sessions each week and is located at Granity School.</p><p>The parent cooperative actively support the team leader in the day-to-day operation of the playcentre.</p><p>The association provides useful policy direction and management services. Office holders, along with fieldworkers, provide professional advice and support to centres to develop and promote the benefits of parent-led early childhood services.</p><p>The playcentre has made good progress with the recommendations since the previous March 2008 ERO review.</p><p>Team leaders foster an inclusive and supportive culture. The programme reflects the playcentre philosophy well.</p><p>Other positive features include:</p><ul>
<li>children who have a strong sense of belonging</li>
<li>children who are confident to make their own choices in the programme</li>
<li>adults who effectively support and extend children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the on-going focus on improving the use of te reo and tikanga Maori across the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The playcentre is well managed and led. It receives a good level of support from the association.</p><p>The team leaders and parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next areas for development are to extend programme planning, and improve aspects of self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Granity/Ngakawau Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atGranity/Ngakawau Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The playcentre&rsquo;s philosophy recognises parents as children&rsquo;s first educators. Team leaders and parents aim to celebrate diversity and like to acknowledge the playcentre&rsquo;s role in partnership with tangata whenua. The curriculum emphasises the values of &lsquo;aroha, respect, integrity, flexibility, endeavour and generosity&rsquo;.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Programme</h4><p>Children benefit from the wide variety of opportunities for play experiences indoors and outdoors. Team members are very responsive to children&rsquo;s learning interests and skilfully support and extend children&rsquo;s play. They make good use of questioning to build on children&rsquo;s thinking.</p><p>On the day of the review many children were well engaged in their interests for sustained periods of time. Adults encouraged children&rsquo;s independence.</p><p>The programme provides an appropriate focus on developing children&rsquo;s social skills and fostering biculturalism. ERO observed te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori being used in ways that are meaningful to children and families. Links with the local school help to support a successful transition to school for children and families.</p><h4>Interactions</h4><p>Positive and supportive relationships between adults and children foster children&rsquo;s well-being and sense of belonging. Children generally play well with and alongside others. Adults are responsive to meeting the needs of children. Most adults are actively involved in children&rsquo;s play. ERO observed adults working well together and communicating effectively.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p>The play areas provide children with a wide range of opportunities to explore and develop their interests. There is a good range of accessible resources, including natural resources to support children. Children were observed sharing and enjoying books and using them to find out information. Attractive and informative wall displays clearly identify children&rsquo;s current interests and involvement in the programme. The team leader, in particular, makes good use of children&rsquo;s assessment to inform what happens in the programme.</p><h4>Leadership and management</h4><p>Several leadership and management practices are helping to enhance the quality of care and education for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the way the team leader focuses on promoting ongoing centre improvement</li>
<li>the operational framework provided by the Association</li>
<li>the extent to which parents are encouraged and supported to take part in the training available through the playcentre</li>
<li>the recent increase in opportunities for adults to formally reflect on activities and children&rsquo;s learning as a regular part of the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Programme planning, evaluation and self review</h4><p>The playcentre team leaders and parents have identified and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to build on existing programme planning and evaluation practices and extend aspects of self review.</p><p>To help bring about ongoing improvements in planning and evaluation:</p><ul>
<li>group programme planning should identify more clearly the learning focuses and the teaching approaches they might be used</li>
<li>better use should be made of the daily programme notes, observations and assessments to clarify the goals and intended outcomes of planned programmes</li>
<li>programme evaluations need to link back to intended learning outcomes and the teaching approaches being fostered.</li>
</ul><p>To enhance self review, team leaders and parents:</p><ul>
<li>should extend the scope of self review to include reviews that focus more on the quality of teaching and learning</li>
<li>further utilise approaches such as parent surveys to evaluate how well the playcentre reflects its philosophy.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Granity/Ngakawau Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ul>
<li>contact the Ministry of Education to clarify what assessment and management of risks documentation is required when the centre undertakes an excursion or outing.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance. In order to address these, centre managers must:</p><ol>
<li>ensure that external doors, fences and gates of the premises where children are attending are designed to ensure that children are not able to leave the premises without the knowledge of adults providing education and care.&nbsp;(13) Premises and Facilities criteria Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</li>
<li>ensure that records of all outings and excursions include an assessment and management of risks.&nbsp;(17) Health and Safety criteria Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</li>

The playcentre is open for three sessions each week and is located at Granity School.</p><p>The parent cooperative actively support the team leader in the day-to-day operation of the playcentre.</p><p>The association provides useful policy direction and management services. Office holders, along with fieldworkers, provide professional advice and support to centres to develop and promote the benefits of parent-led early childhood services.</p><p>The playcentre has made good progress with the recommendations since the previous March 2008 ERO review.</p><p>Team leaders foster an inclusive and supportive culture. The programme reflects the playcentre philosophy well.</p><p>Other positive features include:</p><ul>
<li>children who have a strong sense of belonging</li>
<li>children who are confident to make their own choices in the programme</li>
<li>adults who effectively support and extend children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the on-going focus on improving the use of te reo and tikanga Maori across the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The playcentre is well managed and led. It receives a good level of support from the association.</p><p>The team leaders and parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next areas for development are to extend programme planning, and improve aspects of self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p></html>
