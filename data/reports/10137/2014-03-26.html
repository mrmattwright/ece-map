</table><p>Akoteu To‚Äôo Lelei needs support to develop the quality of the curriculum and the effectiveness of centre management and governance.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu To‚Äôo Lelei is a Tongan immersion early childhood centre. Its philosophy places an emphasis on promoting Tongan language and culture.</p><p>The centre is associated with and located by the Tongan Methodist Church in Northcote. It is governed by a board of trustees that includes a parent representative. The centre has been licensed for up to 35 children over the age of two.</p><p>The head teacher, who was appointed in 2012, leads a staff of two other provisionally registered teachers. Teachers have recently accessed professional support to develop strategic planning and appraisal systems.</p><p>Many of the areas for further improvement identified in the centre‚Äôs 2010 ERO report have not been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Akoteu To‚Äôo Lelei provides a basic curriculum that should now be enhanced to have a greater focus on offering children sufficient challenge in their learning.</p><p>Teachers support children to learn through play. Children have access to resources and the outdoor learning environment. They participate in routines in a calm and settled environment.</p><p>Children enjoy positive, respectful relationships with adults and with each other. Children are valued and have a strong sense of belonging. The centre‚Äôs learning environment celebrates Tongan culture. Most children speak fluently in the Tongan language and teachers are beginning to include te reo MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>Teachers keep records of children‚Äôs progress and parents can access this information. More focused leadership is needed to help teachers embed new practices and make ongoing improvements to planning processes and the programme for children.</p><p>There is not yet a sound understanding in the service of how to undertake robust and useful self review. The service needs to develop an ongoing cycle of self review to help monitor how well it is meeting legislative requirements and delivering quality in children‚Äôs learning. Effective self review will help teachers to make informed decisions and identify priorities for development.</p><p>The head teacher has accessed professional development on appraisal and strategic planning. However the centre is yet to develop a strategic vision. It would be beneficial for long-term planning to focus on improving learning outcomes for children. Strategies to improve the sustainability of the centre also need to be addressed urgently. Self review processes should be used to monitor and share progress towards strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers discussed the following priorities for development.</p><p>To help children to be more actively engaged as learners, teachers need to increase the level of challenge and complexity in the programme. Teachers should participate in professional learning that focuses on:</p><ul>
<li>the development and documentation of good quality learning outcomes in teachers' planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>the promotion of children‚Äôs thinking, expression and creativity</li>
<li>the use of open ended questions to challenge and interest children</li>
<li>ways to increase the range of resources available to children</li>
<li>the support provided for children‚Äôs transition to school, based on good practice aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Trustees and the centre manager should strengthen management and governance practices by ensuring that:</p><ul>
<li>effective strategic and financial management sustains the centre‚Äôs viability</li>
<li>the centre‚Äôs strategic plan focuses on outcomes for children's learning</li>
<li>appraisal processes include use of the registered teachers‚Äô criteria and that the head teacher‚Äôs appraiser is experienced in curriculum matters</li>
<li>regular management meetings are held and minutes and actions are documented.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to develop effective self review. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing documented processes and guidelines for self review that include using indicators to help gauge the extent to which goals have been met</li>
<li>reviewing the centre‚Äôs philosophy and the effectiveness of the curriculum programme against the strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu To'o Lelei completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum management and health and safety. To meet legal requirements the service must ensure that:</p><p>1. all non registered staff are regularly police vetted¬†<em>[Education Act 1983, 5.319]</em></p><p>2. an on-going process of self-review is implemented to improve the quality of education and care for children¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> (GMA6)]</p><p>3. teaching practices are based on current research about best practice in early childhood education¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> (GMA6)].</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu To'o Lelei will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
