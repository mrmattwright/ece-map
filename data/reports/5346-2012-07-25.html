<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Churton Park Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children are independent learners who make choices about where and with whom to play. A wide range of high-quality resources and materials supports their play, learning and creativity. There is a strong emphasis on early literacy learning and numeracy. The programme and environment celebrates and integrates M&#257;ori culture meaningfully fostering children&rsquo;s understanding and appreciation of the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Teachers participate in daily discussion to reflect on, and respond to, children&rsquo;s interests. Regular visits to local schools assist them in their transition to primary school.</p><p>Children are confident, outgoing, clearly articulate their ideas and initiate conversation. Teachers are responsive, nurturing and promptly give praise. They celebrate diversity and are inclusive of children&rsquo;s differing needs. Children&rsquo;s developing social competence is fostered.</p><p>Continual upgrades of the building, grounds and equipment ensures attractive surroundings for children&rsquo;s play and learning and workspace for staff. The indoor environment is attractive and well resourced. The outdoors invites and provides physical challenge.</p><p>The kindergarten community is active and events are well supported. Family members contribute to the programme through sharing their expertise and aspects of their culture. Teachers communicate well and work collaboratively with families to benefit children&rsquo;s well-being.</p><p>Areas of teachers&rsquo; practice require strengthening to better support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers continue to develop their understanding and practice in self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Churton Park Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atChurton Park Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
<li>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</li>
<li>association management and support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO report recommended that teachers further refine assessment, planning and evaluation practice and strengthen the programme of learning and self review. Teachers have worked to improve these areas.</p><p>In 2009 a veranda extension was added to the building to enable physical play opportunities in all weather conditions. The kindergarten operating hours were reorganised in 2011. Older children enrol for either three full days or for five mornings a week. The younger ones attend two morning sessions each week. Parent helpers and a support teacher enhance the child-to-adult ratios.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Bicultural practice </strong></p><p>The programme and environment celebrates and integrates M&#257;ori culture meaningfully. In collaboration with wh&#257;nau, teachers have worked to develop their understandings and increase the bicultural content in the programme. Children are familiar with a range of waiata and know the protocols and their roles in p&#333;whiri. They are developing a good understanding and appreciation of the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p><strong>Programme </strong></p><p>Children are independent learners who choose where and with whom to play. Family members contribute to the programme through sharing their expertise and aspects of their culture. There is a strong emphasis on early literacy learning and numeracy. Teachers participate in daily discussion to reflect on, and respond to, children&rsquo;s interests.</p><p><strong>Assessment </strong></p><p>Children&rsquo;s individual portfolios are highly visual and focus on their developing skills and relationships. Learning dispositions are increasingly recognised. Family contributions are valued and learning stories increasingly record the two-way communication between them and teachers. Children demonstrate ownership of their portfolio and enjoy looking through the entries and discussing them with their peers and adults.</p><p><strong>Interactions </strong></p><p>Children are friendly, outgoing, clearly articulate their ideas and initiate conversation. They confidently seek adults out for company and support. Teachers are responsive, nurturing and promptly give praise when children persevere at tasks. Children&rsquo;s developing social competence is fostered. Teachers celebrate diversity and are inclusive of children&rsquo;s differing needs. Staff communicate well and work collaboratively with families to support children&rsquo;s well-being.</p><p><strong>Environment</strong></p><p>A wide range of high-quality resources and materials supports children&rsquo;s play, interests and creativity. The print-rich environment promotes children&rsquo;s literacy learning. The sloping terrain is effectively used to make good provision for physical challenge and dexterity. Regular upgrades of the building, grounds and equipment ensures attractive surroundings for children&rsquo;s play and workspace for staff.</p><p><strong>Self review </strong></p><p>Teachers continue to develop their understanding and practice in self review. Spontaneous review is regular and used as tool for improvement. The outcomes for children are evaluated and reflected on.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><strong>Supporting children&rsquo;s learning</strong></p><p>Areas of teachers&rsquo; practice require strengthening to better support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to deepen the analysis of narrative observations to capture the significance for the child rather than identifying the generic values inherent in activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using opportunities to extend thinking, promote language, provide challenge and participate in sustained conversations with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focusing and building on the children&rsquo;s interests and strengths rather than on skill development and needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Self review </strong></p><p>Teachers should continue to develop their understanding and use of robust, planned self review to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the learning programme and their teaching practice.</p><h3>Association management and support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Churton Park Kindergarten completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-churton-park-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Churton Park Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Churton Park Kindergarten.</p><p>Churton Park Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children are independent learners who make choices about where and with whom to play. A wide range of high-quality resources and materials supports their play, learning and creativity. There is a strong emphasis on early literacy learning and numeracy. The programme and environment celebrates and integrates M&#257;ori culture meaningfully fostering children&rsquo;s understanding and appreciation of the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Teachers participate in daily discussion to reflect on, and respond to, children&rsquo;s interests. Regular visits to local schools assist them in their transition to primary school.</p><p>Children are confident, outgoing, clearly articulate their ideas and initiate conversation. Teachers are responsive, nurturing and promptly give praise. They celebrate diversity and are inclusive of children&rsquo;s differing needs. Children&rsquo;s developing social competence is fostered.</p><p>Continual upgrades of the building, grounds and equipment ensures attractive surroundings for children&rsquo;s play and learning and workspace for staff. The indoor environment is attractive and well resourced. The outdoors invites and provides physical challenge.</p><p>The kindergarten community is active and events are well supported. Family members contribute to the programme through sharing their expertise and aspects of their culture. Teachers communicate well and work collaboratively with families to benefit children&rsquo;s well-being.</p><p>Areas of teachers&rsquo; practice require strengthening to better support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers continue to develop their understanding and practice in self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
