</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Ponsonby is situated in a converted house in a residential area of Ponsonby. The BestStart Education and Care organisation provides the overarching structure and support for governance and management. A longstanding centre manager and two acting head teachers work closely with a BestStart Management team. All teachers are qualified and permanent.</p><p>This service is licensed for up to 41 children, with a maximum of 12 aged under two years. Families have diverse cultural backgrounds. The ground floor is organised into areas for infants and toddlers and for those aged two to four years. A downstairs area is assigned to children aged over four, who also have free access to an outside play space. Other children use this space at selected times.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted that the centre's curriculum was well designed with a strong focus on wellbeing, high quality relationships and a settled environment. Planning, assessment, evaluation and strategic planning were identified as areas for further development. Improved access to the outdoor space for younger children was also suggested. The centre continues to work on these next steps, along with reviewing the quality of the learning environment, and the programme for supporting children as they transition to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Caring and trusting relationships between children, and with teachers, reflect a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers are affirming, nurturing and warm. An inclusive atmosphere and a visible commitment to endorsing the culture, language and identity of each family is evident in programme, environment and practice. Te reo MƒÅori is naturally integrated into the programme through conversation, waiata and karakia.</p><p>Children are engaged, happy and confident to explore the environment. Their interests and preferences guide their play, and they also learn through established care routines, which are respectfully and appropriately managed. Teachers promote literacy, mathematics, science and creative activities through the programme. Resources and materials are purposefully placed to encourage children's exploration and independence. Regular visits to a nearby park provide children with greater space and opportunity for learning. Managers continue to review the overall layout of the centre to ensure that children have equitable access to outdoor play.</p><p>Portfolios and interactive wall displays allow children to create and rearrange photos, pictures, words, and numbers and to revisit their past learning experiences. Teachers document children's key interests and activities in portfolios, which identify significant moments of learning for individuals and groups of children. In these documents, some teachers identify ways that they can support and extend learning in purposeful ways. This good practice could be extended for greater consistency in assessment, planning and teaching.</p><p>Families receive good information about the ways that children learn, in relation to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre has initiated a primary caregiver approach that supports teachers to build strong, trusting relationships with infants and young toddlers and their families. The centre plans to create further ways to engage meaningfully with parents about children's learning and care. This development includes teachers supporting the growing numbers of children and their families who speak languages other than English at home.</p><p>Strategic goals are focused on improving centre operations and the curriculum. BestStart provides appropriate professional development. Managers value self review, and have identified key areas for improvement. Regular staff meetings highlight information about children's interests, strengths and dispositions for learning. Managers encourage teachers to use this information to review the effectiveness of teaching and to share good practices.</p><p>Self review could be enhanced by the use of clear indicators of effective practice to measure the impact of teaching practices on children's learning. The centre should also now prioritise a formal review of the quality of the programme and suitability of the environment in the downstairs area, to improve and extend teaching and learning for older children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager has identified the need to strengthen teaching consistency and capability. BestStart managers also agree that next steps for this service include reviewing and improving:</p><ul>
<li>the preschool environment and programme</li>
<li>the consistency and quality of teachers' interactions with children</li>
<li>assessment, so that teachers plan deliberate teaching strategies in the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Ponsonby completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Ponsonby will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
