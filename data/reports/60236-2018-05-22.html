</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cloud Kids Educare is located in Masterton and provides education and care for children aged up to five years. It is licensed for 30 children with provision for eight children up to two years old. Of the 26 children enrolled, 15 identify as MƒÅori and two as Pacific.</p><p>Cloud Kids Educare is part of the Masterton Family Education Support Centre that offers parent education and social work support for families and whƒÅnau. A management committee oversees the overall operation of the centre. At the end of 2017, the centre's supervisor left and the centre manager took over responsibility for the early childhood programme.</p><p>The Cloud Kids' philosophy focuses on providing a safe, nurturing, learning environment where children and their families develop a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Many children are transported to and from home in the centre van, enabling them to participate in early childhood education.</p><p>The July 2015 ERO report identified areas of practice requiring further development. These included: continuing to develop assessment, planning and evaluation; improving teaching and learning through the development of appraisal and self-review processes; aligning systems and processes to better guide centre operations; and continuing to review ways to support children's independence, including access to toilet facilities. These remain areas for strengthening.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have a clear, inclusive vision that is underpinned by shared values and beliefs and a commitment to New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Aligning and strengthening links between the philosophy, strategic plan and curriculum should be the focus of the centre's planned review. This should support the team to better assess, plan and evaluate teaching and learning.</p><p>Teachers know the children well. Resources are deliberately arranged to encourage choice, exploration and creativity. Children experience challenge and are supported to negotiate, take turns and think of others. A calm, slow pace allows children space and time to lead their learning. Consistently implemented, predictable routines promote children's sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers are aware of and include children's interests and parents' aspirations when they plan the curriculum. The local and wider community is used as a context for learning. Children are provided with literacy experiences that allow them to listen to, speak and play with language in a variety of ways. Children aged up to two years are appropriately integrated into the centre's mixed-age programme. Those with additional needs are well supported with external support accessed as necessary.</p><p>Bicultural practices are increasingly evident. Teachers with expertise actively support their colleagues to use te reo MƒÅori appropriately.</p><p>Teachers' approach to assessment, planning and evaluation for learning continues to require development. Profile books are a useful record. Teachers should consider ways to extend children's thinking through providing links to existing understandings, purposefully promoting new learning and assessing the impact of these programmes. Providing teachers with high quality professional learning opportunities linked to curriculum implementation, assessment, planning and internal evaluation should be a priority for the service.</p><p>Parents are invited to take an active role in their child's learning. Their views are sought. Leaders recognise that further work needs to be undertaken to promote families' full participation and partnership in their children's learning.</p><p>Systems and processes at management level need strengthening to become sustainable. Regular documented review of the centre's strategic direction, practices, policies and implementation of appraisal is urgently required. The understanding and use of internal evaluation to improve practice and outcomes for children requires considerable development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To support sustainability of practice and improve outcomes for children management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give priority to development of leadership and teacher capability to improve curriculum planning, assessment and systematic evaluation of effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen, align and implement key systems and processes at all levels to support operation and improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen partnerships with families and whƒÅnau to support and encourage them to actively participate in their child's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cloud Kids Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to frequency and documentation of evacuation drills, risk assessment for excursions and management of medication.</p><p>Centre management should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emergency drills are implemented three monthly and appropriately recorded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment and management of risks is undertaken prior to children leaving the premises on an excursion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medication administration records are fully documented.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>[<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS8, HS17, HS 28]</em></p><p>To improve practice the centre should ensure that policies and procedures are regularly reviewed.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cloud Kids Educare will be within two years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>22 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
