</table><p>Everest Learning Ltd¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Everest Learning Ltd provides home-based education and services across Auckland, for children up to six years of age. There are currently 64 children enrolled, most of whom are in the care of Oranga Tamariki. Approximately half of the children enrolled are MƒÅori, and another 30 percent have Pacific heritages.</p><p>Caregivers (kaitiaki) provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. Children in the care of Oranga Tamariki live in the same home as their kaitiaki. The owner/director is responsible for service operations, and is one of four visiting teachers (kaiako) who are qualified and registered. Kaiako regularly visit kaitiaki and support them to plan educational programmes for children. Three of the kaiako have been appointed in the past year.</p><p>The service's philosophy is based on a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and respect for te ao MƒÅori. The owner and kaiako work with many social agencies to support and advocate for children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the service, which was established in 2017.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's wellbeing and education are at the heart of the service's operations. Learning records show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children experience caring, respectful relationships with kaitiaki</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>infants are very well supported to develop a sense of belonging, often in their new home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children have good opportunities to participate in community outings and playgroups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum experiences include daily household activities that are based on play interests and the ideas of older children and kaitiaki.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Kaiako documents demonstrate that they work skilfully with kaitiaki, and where possible with families, to plan for and provide programmes for children. Individual learning plans are based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and include what kaitiaki know about each child. Kaiako write monthly records that explain children's learning well. Some kaitiaki record their observations of children, and are beginning to recognise the learning that happens in play. Use of an online tool and social media is helping kaiako to share information with kaitiaki and families.</p><p>Kaiako are learning more about te ao MƒÅori to improve their provision for tamariki MƒÅori. Evaluating the impact of this focus on outcomes for MƒÅori children could be useful. Kaiako could also access resources such as the Ministry of Education's <em>Pasifika Education Plan</em> and <em>TapasƒÅ, the cultural competencies framework for Pacific learners</em>. This might support them to work with kaitiaki to plan and assess programmes that recognise the languages and cultures of Pacific children.</p><p>The service is managed well. A policy framework guides service operations. Good systems are in place to ensure health and safety requirements are being met. Well-documented teacher appraisal and internal evaluation processes show how kaiako think carefully about ways to improve systems and their own practice.</p><p>Purposeful, reciprocal networking with social agencies and a commitment to being strong advocates for children and families, are features of the service. The owner is working with the new kaiako team to build shared understandings about current and future priorities. It could be timely to review the service's philosophy in consultation with kaitiaki and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>kaiako recording how they work with and guide improved kaitiaki practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving curriculum planning, assessment and evaluation systems, including playgroup records, and how individual planning and assessment affirms and responds to children's languages and cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and evaluating improvement-focused annual and long-term plans.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Everest Learning Ltd completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the owner needs to provide information to parents and kaitiaki about the amount and use of Ministry of Education funding received by the service, including equity and advantage funding.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>3 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
