</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tawa Montessori Preschool is a stand-alone, private early learning service which provides education and care for up to 24 children from two to six years of age. There is a focus on the centre reflecting and celebrating its diversity, and promoting communication and partnership with parents and whānau.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, ownership of the service has changed. The new owner manages operations. The head teacher and assistant head teacher were appointed to leadership positions in 2016. Three of the four teachers are registered. Two teachers hold Montessori qualifications.</p><p>The curriculum and philosophy are underpinned by the principles of the Montessori approach and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The mission statement 'to nurture the child's hand, heart and mind' is evident in teaching and children’s learning.</p><p>The April 2014 ERO report identified that teachers needed to further develop assessment, planning and the appraisal process. Progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy learning through play. They explore, discover, and challenge themselves as they care for the gardens, plants and animals in the spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>Warm and respectful interactions between peers and teachers contribute to the calm and peaceful tone of the learning environment. Children show confidence and a sense of wellbeing as they take part in daily activities. Many engage in purposeful learning for sustained periods.</p><p>Teaching and learning focuses appropriately on Montessori values and materials to support children's emerging interests. Ongoing opportunities to build children's understanding of the natural world, science and the arts are woven throughout the programme. There is a strong focus on literacy and mathematics and the building of life skills.</p><p>Assessment and planning continue to develop. Teachers integrate Montessori learning priorities with <em>Te Whāriki</em> learning outcomes. Information about children's interests is gathered through teacher observations and used to inform decisions about children's learning goals. Children's portfolios include learning stories showing participation and progress in using the Montessori materials, emerging interests and strengths. Group stories are shared in newsletters to parents.</p><p>The teaching team plans to carry out a review of assessment practice. Consideration should be given to reviewing the balance between the Montessori approach and the outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> and of teachers' roles in the assessment process.</p><p>Understanding of te ao Māori is promoted through teacher use of te reo Māori with children, which include papatuanuku, waiata, tikanga, kupu Māori, artefacts, stories and celebration of Matariki. Teachers' attendance at te reo Māori professional learning and development is a reflection of their commitment to improve their practice.</p><p>Families' and whānau input and feedback is regularly sought and valued to support decisions about the learning programme and operation. Resources are made available for children and their parents to support the transition to primary school. Teachers write reports for children to support their continuity of learning.</p><p>ERO and teachers agree that areas for further development should include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>seek ways to effectively share individuals' learning with new entrant teachers</li>
<li>strengthen strategies teachers use to support children's emerging ideas and interests</li>
<li>develop partnerships with parents and whānau</li>
<li>build te ao Māori into the curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>A revised approach to review has been recently implemented providing a useful framework to support internal evaluation. Continuing to embed the process and support team members understanding and use of internal evaluation should support ongoing improvement.</p><p>A new process for appraising teachers is in place. Leaders need to apply the revised process with focused observations of teaching practice followed up by constructive feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation found that further emphasis should be placed on sustainable and high quality outcomes for children in decisions about the development of teaching and learning. Centre leaders acknowledge that continued development is required in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tawa Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tawa Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>13 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
