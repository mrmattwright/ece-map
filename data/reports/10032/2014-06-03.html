</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Marne Road Community Kindy provides good quality education and care for children over two years of age. Although most children are either MƒÅori or PƒÅkehƒÅ/NZ European, centre staff cater well for an increasingly diverse community. The centre runs from an attractively renovated villa in a suburban street in Papakura.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report, there is a new teaching team that includes a centre manager and head teacher. The manager looks after the centre‚Äôs daily operations and administration, and the head teacher leads curriculum development.</p><p>Most teachers are fully registered and qualified. The centre continues to be governed by the Kidicorp Organisation. This organisation continues to provide good professional support for teachers and leaders.</p><p>Teachers continually improve learning programmes for children. They have also reviewed the centre‚Äôs philosophy. The centre‚Äôs philosophy promotes opportunities for children to lead their own learning and explore their interests. It also highlights the importance of oral language, including the use of children‚Äôs first or home languages.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified many strengths, including skilful teaching and learning practices, and teachers respecting children as capable, competent learners. It noted that teachers valued biculturalism and promoted meaningful partnerships with whƒÅnau. The report suggested that managers and teachers continue to promote and extend children‚Äôs play, and increasingly evaluate the quality of the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers at Marne Rd Community Kindy provide learning programmes that value children‚Äôs identity, culture and language and their emerging interests. As a result, children engage in meaningful play. They are confident, articulate and sustain their play for periods of time. High levels of social interaction and cooperative play are evident between children. They also work well together in small groups. They engage in interesting and imaginative conversations. They share equipment, take turns and show respect for each other when playing or working in groups.</p><p>Teachers create stimulating mat times for children. These group times are well paced and encourage children to contribute. Teachers introduce a variety of activities to acknowledge and address the specific interests and cultural backgrounds of children.</p><p>Teachers interact well with all children and challenge them to think, solve problems and negotiate with each other. Learning activities are well supported to help children achieve success. Teachers are strengthening the bicultural content of the curriculum and are trialling a project approach to stimulate children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs programme makes clear links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and continues to provide good quality learning opportunities for children. Children develop early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play.</p><p>Managers provide good support for the new team and have systems in place for children and staff wellbeing. Self review is used to evaluate the effectiveness of centre practices and is gradually bringing about improved learning outcomes for children. Leaders are considering how they can raise the quality of self review so that it is more meaningful and includes multiple voices.</p><p>Positive parent and whƒÅnau relationships are evident in the programme. Parents are encouraged to contribute and participate in the learning programme. The centre team are developing strategies to strengthen relationships with the increasingly ethnically diverse group of parents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers identify some next steps that include further:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning, assessment and the evaluation of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>extending children's learning in the programme</li>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy so that it reflects ‚ÄòThe Treaty of Waitangi‚Äô</li>
<li>implementing self-review and strategic and annual planning systems that are inclusive of teachers and families and promote ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Marne Rd Community Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified area of non-compliance relating to centre management. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that there is a space for adults working at the service to use for breaks, meet parents and colleagues in private.</p><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF9].</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Marne Rd Community Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>3 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
