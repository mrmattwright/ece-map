</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Henderson, situated in West Auckland, provides education and care for up to 71 children, including 25 children under two years of age. Three rooms cater for children's different ages and requirements. There is a separate room for babies and infants. The centre is owned and operated by the Lollipops Educare Group. Policies and the management framework of this organisation guide staff in their work.</p><p>Positive, inclusive interactions are fostered by respectful relationships between teachers and children. The contributions of a culturally diverse community of children, teachers and parents supports an inclusive centre culture. The centre's philosophy and practice is influenced by Reggio Emilia and bicultural principles.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report identified that strengthening self review, programme planning, assessment and evaluation would contribute to more positive learning outcomes for children. Consistency among staff in supporting children's social development was another area for development.</p><p>The newly appointed centre director and staff have successfully addressed these areas. They use self review effectively to evaluate and make improvements to their practice and aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in the centre are curious about their world and enjoy the areas of play that teachers organise for them. Teachers ably support children‚Äôs development by affirming their identity and building on their ideas. They skilfully respond to children‚Äôs interests in a variety of contexts. These positive relationships contribute to children‚Äôs confidence as socially competent learners. The programme provides opportunities for children to follow their inquiries and revisit their play.</p><p>Provision for children less than two years of age is well considered and nurturing. Teachers are sensitive to children‚Äôs preferences and requirements. They interact with infants and toddlers in a calm, caring manner.</p><p>Children and parents are warmly welcomed by staff and quickly settle to their routines. Displays of children‚Äôs different languages and experiences reflect responsive teaching. The centre's indoor and outdoor environments include wooden and recycled resources that support children‚Äôs interest in nature and understandings about ecological sustainability. These aspects of the curriculum contribute to the children‚Äôs sense of belonging to the centre, and connection with each other and their teachers.</p><p>Very good relationships with parents/whƒÅnau are evident. Teachers incorporate their aspirations for their children in programme planning. This process has been enhanced by teachers focusing on children's learning dispositions. Parents/whƒÅnau have responded positively to this form of planning and assessment by providing more information and feedback about their children‚Äôs progress.</p><p>The centre's unhurried curriculum promotes literacy and science in the programme. Children confidently share with other children and adults their ideas and nature of their play. Teachers encourage children to use their home language to support their capabilities, including their ability to learn English or te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre has a strong commitment to biculturalism and in embracing diversity. The 14 MƒÅori children on the roll are well supported in their learning. As a result of in-depth review and professional development, bicultural practices are increasingly evident in the centre‚Äôs programme. Teachers use and promote te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Children‚Äôs diverse and special learning needs are catered for well. The centre‚Äôs inclusive approaches and use of the expertise of external agencies support children‚Äôs particular requirements effectively.</p><p>Lollipops Educare Group's guidelines for monitoring and promoting centre improvement have been used by teachers to enhance self review. Centre operations are now guided by clear future planning and a shared vision. During 2015, teachers formed a shared philosophy that reflects the particular nature of the centre and the community it serves. Teachers are responding positively to the collaborative nature of the centre director's leadership and confidently contribute to centre direction.</p><p>Very good quality internal evaluation increasingly informs planning and ongoing centre improvement. Teachers have identified that they would like to strengthen ways they evaluate the impact of their teaching practice on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and Lollipops Educare management agree that teachers could explore ways of increasing opportunities for child-initiated play. Teachers continue to explore new ways to respond to and support children's learning interests and dispositions.</p><p>Such a development would contribute to teachers' ability to highlight and share children‚Äôs progress through their individual records of learning. The valuable information from these rich descriptions of learning over time will enhance partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau that are focused on children's learning.</p><p>The centre is making good progress towards meeting requirements of The Education Council, the teachers' registration and regulatory body and teachers are becoming more confident with the process. Appraisal evidence collected by teachers to show how well they are meeting expected goals will enhance the growing professionalism of staff.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Henderson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Henderson will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
