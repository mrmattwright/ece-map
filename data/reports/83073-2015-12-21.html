</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gladstone Pre-School provides all-day education and care for 63 children up to school age. Children play and learn in two houses, each with its own playground. One house is for children under about two and a half, and the other is for the older children.</p><p>The two houses used to have their own licences but they were combined in 2013. This has enabled the teachers to work more flexibly. Senior teachers lead the teams of teachers in each house. Nearly all of the teachers are qualified.</p><p>The owner/director also operates another centre in Invercargill. She oversees the running of both centres. The director and teachers have made some progress on the recommendations of the 2012 ERO report, but most still require further work.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The children benefit from warm and trusting relationships with their teachers. The children play in a settled way and are very familiar with the daily routines. Parents are welcomed at the centre and feel comfortable to spend time there with their children.</p><p>The teachers are responsive to children’s emotional and care needs. ERO observed conversations between teachers and children that supported their language development and extended their thinking and problem-solving skills. It would be useful for teachers to review the quality of their interactions with children after defining what good interactions look like.</p><p>The teachers in the younger children’s house provide a calm and settled environment. This enhances the sense of security and emotional wellbeing of the children in their care. Infants and toddlers also have many opportunities to explore and make decisions. Equipment is arranged so they can reach it for themselves, they can choose what area to play in, and the teachers offer them many different sensory experiences. The teachers have a well-organised system for transitions so children can move smoothly from one house to the other.</p><p>Teachers and children use waiata, karakia, and some te reo Māori in the course of the day. The annual Polyfest provides an incentive for learning more te reo Māori. In the best examples, the language and culture of Māori children are affirmed in the stories in children’s profile books. The leaders and teachers are working to increase their knowledge and confidence with te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>The children have many worthwhile learning experiences at the centre. The group plans stem from children’s interests and have a focus on further learning. Wall displays make the learning visible for parents. The teachers regularly collect information from parents about their wishes for their children and use this to guide the individual plans. The teachers share their knowledge about children’s interests and learning. Individual planning would be stronger if teachers were more specific about the learning goals and the teaching strategies they will use.</p><p>The leaders and teachers are not yet completely clear about what are the key learning priorities for children in this centre. They should work this out in partnership with parents. When this is done, teachers will be able to be more purposeful in the programme they provide.</p><p>The director has developed a strategic plan that identifies three relevant priorities for the development of the centre. These are bicultural practices, sustainable practices, and building leadership. She has yet to develop an action plan to show how the strategic goals will be achieved across the two centres. An action plan will also help when monitoring progress.</p><p>The director manages the administrative component of the services. She regularly updates policies, keeps up to date with new information, and meets regularly with her senior leaders. It would be helpful to focus these meetings more on leadership matters and on progressing the strategic goals.</p><p>The director is receiving useful external guidance to help build her leadership. Leadership support should be continued and extended to the other centre leaders as well. The director has not yet developed clear expectations for her leadership team and standards for teaching practice. She must establish reporting systems that will assure her that expectations and compliance requirements are being met.</p><p>The director and centre leaders are working to strengthen appraisal processes. There is a new system in place this year that encourages teachers to reflect on their practice and regularly gather relevant evidence. The leaders need to continue to embed and strengthen appraisal practices and ensure they include observations in the process.</p><p>There are some useful self-review processes in place leading to improved practices. The leaders recognise the need to be more evaluative and make better use of indicators in self review.</p><h3>Key next steps</h3><p>The director should:</p><ul>
<li>access external professional support to develop the leadership capacity within the service</li>
<li>establish clear expectations for the senior-leadership team and for teaching practice</li>
<li>implement systems to ensure expectations and compliance requirements are being met.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>in consultation with parents, identify the key learning priorities for children attending the centre</li>
<li>strengthen systems for individual planning</li>
<li>implement a planned approach to bicultural development</li>
<li>build their understanding of self review, including use of indicators</li>
<li>embed and strengthen the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gladstone Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gladstone Pre-School will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>21 December 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
