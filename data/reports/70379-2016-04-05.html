</table><p>Kaiapoi Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaiapoi Preschool is a well-established, small preschool. The owner works on site as the centre manager. The experienced and qualified leaders and teachers have worked together at the centre, for many years. The individual skills of teachers are highly valued and well used.</p><p>The centre has a high ratio of teachers to small numbers of children aged from two to six years old. Teachers plan regular one-on-one sessions with children to help develop individual strengths and capabilities.</p><p>The centre is part of the local Katote Learning Cluster of schools, and early childhood centres. These relationships promote professional networks and provide targeted professional development to support the learning of children in their community from early childhood to school.</p><p>The positive aspects from the previous ERO report in December 2012 have been maintained and some areas identified for development have been addressed. This includes the development of bicultural perspectives in centre documentation. Self-review and evaluative practices remain areas to strengthen.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is highly evident in teacher practices and centre documentation. It is underpinned by shared values and beliefs of the teachers and learning community. It places a strong emphasis on developing positive, inclusive and responsive relationships with children and families to support children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed at the centre. Home and centre partnerships actively encourage parent involvement in their children’s learning and in the life of the centre. A parent group works together to raise funds for additional resourcing and social events for families.</p><p>The child-centred curriculum is based on Te Whāriki, the Early Childhood Curriculum and promotes the interests, skills and capabilities of each child. Literacy, numeracy, music, health and physical activity are a strong focus of the programme and are well integrated into play and learning activities.</p><p>Teachers encourage children’s confidence, independence, and involvement in making decisions about their learning. Children are well supported to take responsibility to care for others, and the environment. They have good opportunities to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices. Purposeful links with the community enhance the curriculum offered to children.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. An increasing level of commitment to bicultural perspectives is evident through documentation that recognises and guides culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children’s learning through informative, well-written learning stories that capture the child’s interests and significant learning. Many parents contribute to their children’s books, sharing special events and the learning that is happening at home.</p><p>Children are well supported to make a positive transition to school. The programme provides a specific focus on transition to support children to become confident learners. Teachers and parents work together to share information with the school so that the school staff know about the child's learning and their family.</p><p>Well organised management systems support the effective operation of the service. Leaders and teachers work well together to reflect on practices. They have a strong, shared commitment to teaching and learning that contributes to positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and ERO agree, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop new strategic priorities, action planning and manageable curriculum self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen self review of programme planning and teaching practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4><b>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</b></h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaiapoi Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>5 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"></a></h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><p style="display: inline !important;"> </p>
