</table><p>Geraldine Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Geraldine Kindergarten is a standalone kindergarten association governed by a board of trustees. The kindergarten has effective links with its local and wider community and makes good use of these to extend children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>A feature of the kindergarten‚Äôs curriculum and philosophy is the emphasis given to developing children‚Äôs skills for learning. In 2012, the kindergarten received an international award for a programme that teaches children and encourages inquiry and independent learning. The head teacher and teachers are developing a framework for this programme that acknowledges New¬†Zealand‚Äôs unique bicultural setting.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated in meaningful ways in the programme and practices.</p><p>Teachers are effectively responding to the increasing numbers of children and families from different cultures. They identify ways to nurture children‚Äôs first languages and are extending their skills to teach English.</p><p>The board is focused on ensuring the kindergarten provides a high-quality service for children and their families. A general manager has a key role in the kindergarten‚Äôs daily administration, including oversight of health and safety systems. The kindergarten works closely with Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association by contracting the services of an education service manager to appraise the head teacher and provide other professional support for the kindergarten throughout the year.</p><p>Partnerships with whƒÅnau are actively encouraged. Parents are consulted regularly and kept well-informed about their children‚Äôs learning. Parents‚Äô views are valued and acted on.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The child-centred curriculum:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>responds effectively to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and capabilities by providing relevant, authentic learning experiences (Nohonga tahitanga) for children within and beyond the kindergarten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gives well-considered emphasis to developing children‚Äôs positive attitudes and learning characteristics (dispositions and habits of mind)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responds appropriately to the high proportion of boys currently attending by providing additional challenges and increased physical activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>values and recognises the language, culture and identity of all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promotes and makes regular use of children‚Äôs views and ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Recent changes to the way teachers plan and assess children‚Äôs learning are having a positive impact on children's learning. Teachers, children and parents have a shared role in identifying learning goals and progress. Learning profiles clearly identify children‚Äôs ongoing learning and show how teachers plan to extend learning for individuals and groups. Children‚Äôs enthusiasm for learning and their understanding of their own learning are captured well in learning stories.</p><p>Whanaungatanga and manaakitanga are strongly reflected in the positive, caring and supportive relationships and interactions between teachers and children and among children.</p><p>Teachers regularly encourage children to be active participants in their own learning through questioning, experimenting and solving problems. Teachers organise and manage the learning environment in ways that motivate children to set their own challenges and make their own discoveries. Children‚Äôs literacy and mathematical learning is made interesting and meaningful. Teachers display children‚Äôs learning experiences so that these can be revisited and shared.</p><p>The experienced and highly skilled head teacher effectively promotes a culture of teamwork and shared decision making. Considerable focus is given to extending teachers‚Äô knowledge and use of effective practices. The head teacher and teachers work together well to achieve the kindergarten‚Äôs vision and goals. Leadership is fostered amongst all teachers. Teachers' individual strengths and interests are used to benefit children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers make good use of resources and research to support self review. A number of curriculum reviews have led to deeper understandings about the best ways to keep the focus of learning on each child and their family. Regular reflection is helping teachers to evaluate how well their practices are supporting children‚Äôs learning and to make changes where necessary to achieve better outcomes.</p><p>The head teacher uses appraisal effectively to recognise teachers‚Äô good practice and identify any areas for further development. Well-targeted professional development is having a positive impact on the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The board of trustees is committed to achieving the vision and goals for the kindergarten with appropriate actions and resources. This is evident in the way the board:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identifies priorities and goals for continual improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledges the importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensures that teachers have high-quality learning and administration support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uses self review for improvement and accountability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognises the importance of good communication in establishing strong family and community links to support the kindergarten‚Äôs ongoing development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps identified by the kindergarten and ERO build on the many existing good practices and recent initiatives to achieve sustainability over time.</p><p>These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the consistent use of the kindergarten‚Äôs high-quality planning, assessment and evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the board‚Äôs review of its effectiveness by making more use of job descriptions, goals and targets.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Geraldine Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Geraldine Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>20 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
