<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waipuna Preschool Centre is a privately owned centre in Mt Wellington, Auckland. It provides an all day service for up to 29 children, including up to 10 children under the age of 2 years. The children have diverse cultural and social backgrounds. A significant number have M&#257;ori heritage. Some children require additional support to learn English as a second language and to have their learning and personal needs met.</p><p>The current two owners, one of whom is the licensee, have owned the centre for the past six years. Both owners are involved in the centre on a daily basis. They form part of a stable teaching team, which includes five qualified teachers, four of whom are registered with the NZ Teachers Council.</p><p>This report, and the 2010 ERO report, acknowledges the very good quality of education and care provided in the centre.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The focus of the centre philosophy, teaching and management practices is for all children to be socially competent and confident learners. Children&rsquo;s decisions and opinions are respected. They are trusted to be leaders of their own learning. They engage happily in the many varied and stimulating learning experiences that the centre provides.</p><p>The owners, teachers and staff value the partnership they have with parents and wh&#257;nau. These relationships enable them to know each child well so that they can provide appropriate care and learning opportunities. The use of a software programme, introduced in 2012, is increasing parent and wh&#257;nau access to information about their children&rsquo;s learning at the centre.</p><p>Equity is an important principle that underpins the way the centre is managed. Particular care and attention is given to babies and toddlers so that they experience a warm and nurturing environment that supports their learning and development. Children with special needs and abilities are well catered for and have positive learning experiences. Centre activities and outings are designed, and additional funding well used, so that all children can participate fully in the programme.</p><p>Acknowledging and celebrating children&rsquo;s cultural identity is a centre priority. Parents, wh&#257;nau and staff are encouraged to share their languages and cultures. Teachers are especially appreciative of the contributions of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Children are well served by the high quality of the centre&rsquo;s curriculum and teaching practice.</p><ul>
<li>Teachers have affectionate and responsive relationships with children and take collective responsibility for the care and education of each child.</li>
<li>Teachers give an appropriate emphasis to enabling children to develop their oral language. They skilfully integrate literacy, numeracy and science learning into children&rsquo;s play.</li>
<li>The curriculum is based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. This curriculum, the centre philosophy, and children&rsquo;s individual and group interests form the basis of programme planning, assessment and evaluation.</li>
<li>The learning environment is well resourced and thoughtfully prepared to support children&rsquo;s learning. The provision of an extensive variety of everyday and recycled materials supports and extends children&rsquo;s imaginative play.</li>
</ul><p>The centre is well managed and well led. Teachers are encouraged and supported to continually increase their teaching knowledge and improve their practice. Clearly delegated responsibilities provide teachers with leadership opportunities. Centre administration is efficient and effective.</p><p>The overall quality of centre self review has improved considerably since the 2010 ERO report through good use of external expertise and resources. A strong culture of self review focuses on promoting positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO affirms the following areas for improvement identified through centre self review:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to review and improve teaching practice</li>
<li>extending the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to benefit the children&rsquo;s learning, teaching practice and the centre&rsquo;s partnership with parents</li>
<li>continuing to evaluate and upgrade resources.</li>
</ul><p>ERO suggests that consideration be given to helping teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>use open-ended questions to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning</li>
<li>align the teaching of literacy, especially for the older children, more closely to current good practices in early childhood education</li>
<li>know about and use strategies for teaching M&#257;ori children and for strengthening partnerships with wh&#257;nau to support that learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waipuna Preschool Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
