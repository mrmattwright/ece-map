</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ko Te Aroha is a community based centre that provides education and care for 30 children from six months old to school age. Based in Masterton east, the centre is committed to being a hub for the community. The current roll includes MƒÅori, Pacific, and PƒÅkehƒÅ learners.</p><p>Whakawhanaungatanga, the relationships based philosophy, is central to the centre‚Äôs ways of being, doing and knowing.</p><p>A parent educator programme has been in place for four years. These parent educators learn alongside teachers, growing and sharing parenting knowledge as well as working with their children.</p><p>The centre is governed by a trust board, and has a long-serving chairperson. Core priorities for the board are to build parent membership to work alongside appointed trustees, extend the range of services offered, and grow trustees‚Äô knowledge of governance. The lead educator provides professional leadership to the well-established teaching team.</p><p>There has been positive progress in addressing the areas for development and review since the February 2013 ERO report. The areas of strength identified continue to be evident. Teachers continue to embed assessment, planning, appraisal and self-review practices.</p><p>Management and trustees encourage and support teacher involvement in ongoing professional learning and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children respond positively to teachers‚Äô view of them as capable and competent learners. Teachers express high expectations for children‚Äôs learning and behaviour. Children engage in activities and play experiences confidently. They enjoy the company of others and older children show care for younger children. Flexible unhurried routines allow children to make choices and be involved in their play for periods of time. Children‚Äôs wellbeing is nurtured.</p><p>Teachers skilfully settle children into the centre. They recognise the importance of building trusting relationships and supporting children‚Äôs social learning. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori naturally in their interactions with children and others. They affirm learners‚Äô language, culture and identity.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs and their families are well supported by caring teachers.</p><p>Teachers use a range of teaching practices that sensitively and respectfully respond to children‚Äôs needs and interests. Teachers positively encourage children‚Äôs interest and involvement in literacy and numeracy experiences.</p><p>Parents are active decision makers in setting learning goals for their children. Teachers value their contributions and the knowledge that families share about their children. Parent educators play an important role in the life of the centre.</p><p>Assessment processes are well understood by teachers and parent educators. Learning journeys show the broad curriculum children experience and provide a record of their learning and development. Teachers are seeking to extend their understanding of <em>Te Whatu P≈çkeka</em>, the assessment exemplars for MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô understanding of self review has improved. They have been supported externally to build practice, and are now leading their own reviews. A sound framework is now in place to guide these inquiries. Current reviews should be useful in supporting decisions around assessment processes at the point of transition to school, and with infant and toddler practices. Building teachers' capability in internal evaluation, to determine how well centre practices enhance children's learning, is an agreed next step.</p><p>The 2015 - 2018 strategic plan has a clear focus on extending community partnerships, and the provision of high quality education and care for children. An agreed next step is further developing the annual actions to show how the board intends to meet its strategic goals. This includes developing processes to show ongoing progress and how well goals are met. The plan should also signal how the board intends to achieve its vision of increasing parent trustee representation.</p><p>There is a sound process for appraising teachers that focuses on building their practice. It includes opportunities for regular observation, discussions, and reflections that align to the Practising Teacher Criteria. The board chair is aware that some development is needed to leaders‚Äô documentation to show more clearly how the framework is based on the criteria.</p><p>Leadership is improvement focused. There is a well-considered approach to change. The experienced lead educator is supporting a strong reflective culture, and promoting shared responsibility for leading across the centre. She provides effective leadership and makes good use of teachers‚Äô strengths to contribute to centre programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The lead educator and trustees have identified areas for continued improvement. Priorities include further developing</p><ul>
<li>Self-review processes</li>
<li>annual planning</li>
<li>processes and access to external training to support trustees with their governance role.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ko Te Aroha completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, appraisal of leaders needs to be based on the Practicing Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ko Te Aroha will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 January 2016</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
