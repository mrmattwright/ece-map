</table><p>Kimihia Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kimihia Early Learning Centre is administrated by the Kimihia Learning Trust. Trustees and centre management work closely together to support positive outcomes for children and families from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Some of the families enrolled are young parents who are continuing their secondary education at Kimihia Parents' College. The early learning centre is next door to the college.</p><p>In 2014, the service became a community centre, extending the early childhood education service to all families in the local community. The centre is focused on providing quality care and education for infants, toddlers and young children from birth-to-five years old.</p><p>The experienced leaders and qualified teachers have been at the centre for many years and have strong links to the community and support agencies. Some teachers have additional qualifications in children's health. Teachers have a strong focus on promoting children's physical and emotional wellbeing. The centre has spacious indoor and outdoor areas, and provides nutritious meals for children.</p><p>The positive practices evident in the previous September 2012 ERO review have continued to be sustained and built on. Leaders and teachers work with other ECE centres and schools, as part of the Linwood Community Cluster, to support the needs of children and families in the community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy reflects the priorities of the centre and its community, and are very evident in teacher practices. The child-centred curriculum is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum, and promotes children's wellbeing and learning. Teachers actively foster respectful relationships, the holistic development of children and the inclusion of family and community.</p><p>Families and children are warmly welcomed and well supported to develop a sense of belonging at the centre. Leaders and teachers work closely with parents to support them in their parenting role. The diverse range of skills and expertise of teachers are valued and well used. Transitions into the centre and between areas are flexible and personalised to the needs of the child and family.</p><p>The language, culture and identity of each child and family is valued. Leaders and teachers are committed to extending their understandings of MƒÅori and Pacific culture and practices.</p><p>Teachers build trusting relationships and foster children's confidence and wellbeing. They make good use of interactions to foster children's independence and social skills.</p><p>The environment is thoughtfully presented to inspire children's curiosity and exploration. The use of the natural materials and real-life learning experiences promote their interests and capabilities. Oral language, literacy, music and creativity are integrated in meaningful ways for children.</p><p>Children under two years old are well supported by consistent, caring teachers in a separate purpose built area. Children benefit from well-paced individualised routines, respectful interactions and a predictable and calm environment. Teachers work closely with parents to support consistent responses to the individual needs and interests of children.</p><p>Parents are well informed of children‚Äôs interests and learning through one-on-one conversations with teachers, informative wall displays and individualised learning stories.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. The leadership team works effectively with teachers to promote positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Centre management systems are efficient and well organised. Strategic planning clearly identifies centre priorities and promotes ongoing improvement. Leaders and teachers are reflective and make good use of self review, external expertise and professional development to build capability and sustainable practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen some management processes. This includes evaluating the impact self review and embedding new appraisal systems</li>
<li>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation documentation. This includes creating clear guidelines that reflect centre expectations, consistently focusing on planning and evaluating teaching strategies and making parent aspirations clearer.</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommend that the service make MƒÅori perspectives more evident in all aspects of centre operation and documentation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kimihia Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kimihia Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>23 March 2016¬†</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

</div><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
