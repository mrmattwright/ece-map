</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Dudes Childcare Centre is located in the Auckland residential suburb of Mt Albert. The privately owned centre, based in a converted house, was purchased by a new licensee/manager in 2012.</p><p>The new manager, an experienced and registered early childhood teacher, has made significant improvements. The manager has worked closely with the Ministry of Education to transition the centre to the 2008 ECE regulations. Considerable renovation and upgrading has taken place and the manager expects to fully meet the new licensing requirements within a few weeks.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 23 children aged two to five years. Most of the children on the roll attend the full day programme. However, there are flexible options and sessions available to meet the needs of families. The new owner has appointed new staff and implemented new personnel management systems. Three of the five teachers are fully qualified and two are in training.</p><p>The learning programme reflects the diverse range of cultures of the children and their families. A new position of programme supervisor has been created to guide teacher planning and evaluation. ERO‚Äôs previous report recommended improvements in the quality of the service. These matters are now being addressed as part of the overall changes made by the new owner and manager.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre promotes positive learning outcomes for children. All aspects of centre management and programme planning have been reviewed over the past twelve months. The new manager has consulted staff about raising the quality of the services and has acted on the feedback received.</p><p>Teachers engage positively with children and encourage their questions and inquiry. Children settle quickly on arrival. They have a clear sense of belonging and look forward to their time at the centre. Teachers know the children well and respect their cultural backgrounds and languages.</p><p>Children have increased choices in both indoor and outdoor play. They are benefitting from the reorganisation of equipment and the attractive ways that teachers arrange the learning environment to reflect children‚Äôs current learning interests.</p><p>Children are gaining confidence to play more spontaneously and creatively. Teachers notice and record children‚Äôs interests and share their observations at planning meetings. Teachers understand their role in supporting children‚Äôs learning and are becoming more skilled in responding to children‚Äôs interests and extending their play.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are welcome in the centre. The manager invites parents‚Äô comments and feedback, particularly when children have special learning needs. Information for parents is well displayed and children‚Äôs learning portfolios are readily available. Parents support the centre and special events organised by staff are well attended.</p><p>The centre manager is a considerate employer. Facilities for staff use have improved and there is now designated non-contact and planning time. New appraisal systems are being introduced that encourage teachers to reflect on their practice and develop professionally.</p><p>The new manager is committed to improving centre operation. Management policies have been updated and the centre philosophy is being currently evaluated. The manager provides good leadership and has the capability for sustaining improvements.</p><p>Staff are encouraged to evaluate the learning programme and actively contribute to self review. Feedback from staff about priorities for improvement has resulted in major improvements to the outdoor areas and the inclusion of authentic MƒÅori bicultural perspectives. New strategic planning systems are guiding future developments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager has priorities for ongoing centre improvement. ERO agrees that further emphasis on strengthening self review is very likely to sustain current good practice and result in ongoing improvement. ERO and the centre manager agree that the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>completing the centre philosophy review so that agreed good practices can be used by staff to evaluate the programme</li>
<li>continuing to develop systems for supporting children‚Äôs transitions into early childhood and on to school</li>
<li>incorporating the Registered Teacher Criteria into the revised appraisal systems so that staff performance can be attested in relation to teacher registration requirements</li>
<li>continuing to improve teacher observations so that children‚Äôs developments can be clearly and simply shared with parents and used to inform teacher planning</li>
<li>continuing to redesign the interior space to increase teachers‚Äô engagement with a wide range of children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Dudes Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Dudes Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>6 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
