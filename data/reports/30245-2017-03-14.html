</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whaihanga Early Learning Centre is located on the grounds of Knighton Normal School in the suburb of Hillcrest in Hamilton City. It is licensed to provide full-day education and care for children from six months to school age. The centre's roll of 42, includes 22 Māori and children from a variety of different ethnic backgrounds. It operates a mixed-age programme that promotes a strong family-like atmosphere supported by tuakana/teina relationships among children.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the CNI Early Education Services Trust (CNIEEST) which continues to contract Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT) to provide professional support for programme delivery, policy, administration and personnel management.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in January 2014, a new centre manager has been appointed and there have been several changes in the teaching team. The areas of good performance identified in the previous ERO report continue to be evident at the centre. Good progress has been made in addressing the areas for development about strengthening assessment practice and integrating the language, culture and identity of children within the programme.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is underpinned by the concepts of whanaungatanga, aroha, toanga o paptūānuku and whaihangatanga.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from participating in a rich and broad programme that reflects the centre’s philosophy and responds to their emerging interests. Well-managed flexible routine times support children's involvement in sustained, uninterrupted play. The implementation of a 'key teacher' system effectively supports children's sense of wellbeing, and promotes responsive relationships with whānau. Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>high-quality literacy and mathematics learning opportunities for children that are naturally integrated through play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the inclusion of science learning and a demonstrated commitment to environmental sustainability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>real-life learning experiences that reflect home environments and whānau aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the recognition of each child's language culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children's opportunities to explore and experience physical challenge are supported by regularly accessing the local school's environment and playing fields.</p><p>Children with special learning needs are well provided for within an inclusive environment. The centre manager accesses appropriate external expertise to support teachers and whānau to respond effectively in meeting the education and care requirements of these children.</p><p>There are high levels of trust among teachers, whānau and children. Whānau are increasingly involved in centre operations and are well supported by centre staff. Sharing the rationale and positive impact of the centre's approaches to important aspects of the programme with the local school is likely to strengthen key partnerships for learning.</p><p>Attractively presented individual portfolios that are also accessible for whānau in digital format provide parents with a comprehensive record of children’s involvement in the programme. They effectively identify learning and development over time. Teachers make good use of this assessment information to extend children's interests and learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from playing and learning with and alongside their older whānau members and peers. Their care needs are well met, and teachers work closely with whānau to reflect home priorities.</p><p>Māori children’s language, culture and identity are effectively recognised and celebrated by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' increasing use of te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manaakitanga interactions with and among children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the incorporation of te ao Māori in the centre's environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders recognise the importance of establishing a relationship with the neighbouring Kirikiriroa Marae to further promote the centre's commitment to incorporating New Zealand's bicultural heritage.</p><p>Teachers work well together to respond to the education and care needs of children. They have responsive and caring relationships with children and whānau. Teachers use a wide range of strategies that promote children's thinking and problem solving, which support the development of social competencies. They thoughtfully present and refresh the environment to provoke children’s interests and extend learning. Responsive teaching contributes to children's development as secure, confident, communicators who are able to play and learn alongside others.</p><p>The centre manager provides knowledgeable and well-informed leadership. She is highly respected by teachers and whānau, and models effective teaching practice. A distributed leadership model supports a learning culture among the teaching team and empowers teachers to share their strengths and expertise for the benefit of children. Comprehensive and well-established self-review processes support ongoing centre development. Collaborative leadership approaches are effectively building teacher capability to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><p>CNIKT provides effective governance for the centre. A well-developed policy framework guides centre operations. Experienced association professional leaders are supportive of the centre manager and provide useful feedback to the teaching staff about the effectiveness of centre operations. CNIKT provides extensive professional learning and development opportunities for teachers. A comprehensive teacher appraisal process meets the requirements of the Education Council and supports teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their practices. This system could be further strengthened by more regular documented observations of teaching practice. Comprehensive governance systems support leaders and teachers to promote positive outcomes for children and whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for the centre manager and teachers, is to further strengthen learning partnerships with whānau and other groups in the local community.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whaihanga Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whaihanga Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>14 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
