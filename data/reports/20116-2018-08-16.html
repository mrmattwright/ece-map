</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Naval Community Daycare - Calliope House located in Devonport, Auckland, provides good quality education and care for 50 children from two years of age up five years of age. The centre operates in conjunction with nearby Tamariki House, which provides for babies and toddlers. Both centres operate under the Naval Community Childcare Centres Association, an incorporated Society and Charitable Entity, providing Early Childhood Education and Care to children of NZDF Personnel working at the Devonport Naval Base and on Naval Ships.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is underpinned by creating an environment that encourages courageous play, respect and care. Working in partnership with whƒÅnau and celebrating the Navy as a way of life is central to the core values for the centre. Teaching is guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre management team that runs the day-to-day operation of the centre is comprised of an experienced registered head teacher and an office administrator. They are supported by a team of dedicated staff.</p><p>Good practices identified in the 2015 ERO evaluation report have been strengthened and sustained. Key recommendations included formalising programme planning, strengthening evaluation and assessment practices, and reviewing the effectiveness of the appraisal system. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>Extensive plans are underway to upgrade and rebuild the outdoor environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, happy and demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. The centre is an inclusive "community hub" for Navy parents. WhƒÅnau who spoke to ERO value the nurturing, respectful relationships that their children experience.</p><p>A significant feature of Naval Community Daycare - Calliope House, is the effective way the centre embraces the essence of Haere K≈çtui (weaving and combining the essential strands of individual commitment and contribution with a sense of collective focus and responsibility) through the connections to the wider navy community on land and at sea.</p><p>Children benefit from thoughtful transitions through and between the centres and on to school. Children with additional learning needs are well supported, including with transition processes. External support is provided when required.</p><p>Children are able to make choices about how and where they play. They are engaged and readily sustain their play. Children learn in mixed age groups, and for part of the day, they learn in four age related groups. Teachers make links to the children‚Äôs home experiences that build on their prior knowledge and strengths. There are some good examples of teachers successfully using questioning to extend children‚Äôs thinking.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children to support and promote their development. Parent aspirations are valued and used to inform programme planning. Teachers integrate topic investigations and children's interests into programmes and learning activities to support children‚Äôs engagement and learning.</p><p>Children have easy access throughout the centre and to the spacious, well presented outdoor play areas. The outdoor areas are designed to provide experiences that help children develop physically, emotionally and intellectually. Centre managers have plans to review the inside learning environment and resources to ensure that they offer the same level of intellectual and emotional challenges as the outdoor areas.</p><p>Staff have strengthened their bicultural practices through kapa haka, waiata, te reo MƒÅori, group activities and festive celebrations. The positive impact of their increasing knowledge of tikanga MƒÅori is evident in the depth of bicultural practices in the centre.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning stories are well used by families. Parents are able to take advantage of the digital technology that gives them daily access to information about their children‚Äôs learning and enables them to provide feedback. Good work has been done to celebrate MƒÅori children's identity. Teachers could now consider ways to increase the visibility of children's other languages and cultures in their individual learning portfolios.</p><p>Teachers are collegial and work collaboratively. They are encouraged and supported by a mentor and the head teacher to be reflective practitioners. Appraisal documents focus on teaching as inquiry. This has contributed to a robust performance management system. Well selected professional development promotes and guides teachers' practice and increased capability.</p><p>Governance and management is efficient and effective. There are clear and well established guidelines and the purpose of internal evaluation to promote ongoing improvement is well understood. Effective systems, policies and procedures are consistently implemented and regularly monitored to guide centre practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>align strategic and annual plans and further develop indicators that can be used to gauge how well the centre is progressing over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote teaching strategies that deepen children's thinking to support complexity in their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the inside learning environment and resources with a view to ensuring that they reflect the centre vision and philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Naval Community Daycare - Calliope House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Naval Community Daycare - Calliope House will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>16 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
