<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>MiniMARC Childcare Centre is reasonably well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>MiniMARC is a not-for-profit childcare centre providing education and care for children of parents who work at the Mt Albert Research Centre. The centre is situated in the grounds of the Research Centre and enjoys close links with parents from Plant and Food Research and Environmental Science Research. It is managed by a governance committee of parents and staff.</p>
<p>Children between the ages of six months and five years attend the centre. Many have developed close relationships with the other children and the older children enjoy talking together.</p>
<p>Planning is well underway to develop another centre on site. The new centre will cater for a similar age range, and will enable the service to meet more of parents&rsquo; needs for their children. The development of the new centre has been facilitated by the provision of more land on the site of the existing centre.</p>
<p>MiniMARC has a good reporting history with ERO and continues to focus on providing well for children. The majority of teachers hold relevant qualifications. They are reflective about their work and eager to implement current teaching strategies and philosophical approaches.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are able to make choices about their activities and are able to play without interruption for most of the day. Although they have a separate space, younger children are confident to choose where they play. Their physical needs are well met through responsive routines. Most children fit easily and happily into the centre and enjoy their day.</p>
<p>Mutually respectful relationships between teachers and parents are well developed. Teachers promote an open-door policy and encourage parents to visit when possible. Several mothers return to the centre several times a day to feed their infants. Parents are comfortable and relaxed in the centre.</p>
<p>Teachers have established a relationship with a local marae and visit with children twice each year. Children are familiar with waiata and are able to respond appropriately to instructions and phrases in te reo M&#257;ori. Resources include some with New Zealand and M&#257;ori themes and all children are gaining a sense of the bicultural heritage of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Teachers have recently undertaken professional development to help them improve assessment and planning practices. Teachers are experimenting with new ways of recording what they notice about children&rsquo;s play and sharing this information to guide their planning so that they meet children&rsquo;s interests. They are finding these new strategies effective in informing their practice and building their knowledge about children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>The recent loss of a number of older children from the centre has lowered the average age of the children attending. With this in mind, teachers should now rethink their strategy of waiting for children to start conversations. The curriculum framework requires teachers to engage children in meaningful, positive interactions to enhance their learning and to nurture reciprocal relationships.</p>
<p>Parents are decision makers on the governance committee. Regular updates about all aspects of centre management enable them to work efficiently for the good of their children. Strategic planning towards the development of the new building has been thorough. Policy review by the committee is regular and consultative.</p>
<p>Transitions into the centre are supportive and are positive events for children. Teachers visit children&rsquo;s homes before and after they join the centre, learning more about children&rsquo;s home backgrounds. These visits enable teachers to consider ways of reflecting children&rsquo;s interests in their choice of resources and activities.</p>
<p>Teaching leadership in the centre is largely reliant on the head teacher. Teachers share and discuss new knowledge about current practices in early childhood education and it now would be useful to find ways of building their capacity as professional practitioners. Managers agree with ERO that it would be advantageous to:</p>
<ul><li>take a more systematic approach to providing whole-centre professional development based on findings from self review and appraisal</li>
<li>encourage teachers to develop a shared philosophy of teaching and learning</li>
<li>provide opportunities for teachers to take a more proactive role in leadership</li>
<li>review how well the centre meets the 2008 early childhood regulations and the principles, aims and goals of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>The governance committee should also revisit their strategic planning, which has focused recently on the new building. Members should now develop a strategic direction to guide all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s future in relation to finances, property, personnel and resources.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of MiniMARC Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
