</table><p>Leap Ahead Early Childhood Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leap Ahead Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned and operated service in the rural township of Methven. It runs all-day sessions for a licensed maximum of 41 children, including up to 14 children aged under two. Children enrolled at the centre represent the ethnic diversity of the Methven community.</p><p>The owner and a manager have oversight of all aspects of governance and management. All teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The centre's philosophy, influenced by Te Whariki, the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum, has a focus on 'capable, confident children who can communicate, learn and work with others'.</p><p>Centre leaders have made very good progress in addressing most of the areas for further development identified in ERO's June 2016 report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in two inviting and 'stress free' learning rooms. Teachers interact in a calm and friendly manner with children. Learning relationships with parents are valued, and the daily timetable has been structured to ensure that teachers have adequate time to talk with families. The environment is embraced as the 'third teacher', and children have easy access to a variety of indoor and outdoor activities with varying degrees of challenge.</p><p>A thoughtful transition process assists younger children to settle at the centre and move between rooms. Children with additional needs are well supported. The transition to school process is well informed and reflects the close connections the centre has with local schools and the other learning centre in the community.</p><p>The curriculum is thoughtfully constructed and responds well to children's needs, including health and wellbeing, and interests. Through effective modelling and guiding, the centre manager has developed consistency of practice in the way teachers plan and document children's learning. To ensure that there is appropriate curriculum coverage, the centre manager analyses learning stories to monitor the range of outcomes addressed, teaching strategies used and children's progress. She provides effective feedback to teachers about the quality of their planning and practice based on this analysis. Parent aspirations are captured and inform planning, which is highly visible in both of the teaching rooms.</p><p>The use of te reo and home languages, as part of everyday learning experiences, is developing. Intentional strategies for MƒÅori children, and promoting language, culture and identity for other children, are areas for further development.</p><p>The centre leaders are improvement-focused. This focus is underpinned by a clearly articulated vision, effective strategic planning and useful internal evaluation practices which align with strategic goals and directions. Systems and processes are well understood, organised and implemented. Teachers are effectively supported by the manager to improve their practice, with an emphasis on promoting positive outcomes for children. Professional learning opportunities are linked to strategic planning and teacher needs, providing further opportunities to develop capability and practices that support children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To ensure that planning and learning experiences identify and promote language, culture and identity for all, particularly for MƒÅori children and children from other cultures, centre leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>select specific teaching strategies to promote te reo, tikanga and te ao MƒÅori and the language, culture and identity of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explore approaches to effectively consult with all families and ensure that a range of voices inform centre policy and practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leap Ahead Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified two areas of non-compliance:</p><ul>
<li>the service provider must ensure that teacher appraisals comply with Teaching Council requirements for two formal documented observations of teacher practice annually and an annual summary document which provides sufficient evidence for the registration process <br><em>[Licensing criterion for Early childhood and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></li>
<li>
<p>risk management for all excursions needs to be documented, accurate and include information about teacher ratios. The centre improved this process while ERO was onsite.<br> <em>[Licensing criterion for Early childhood and Care Centres 2008, HS12]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>13 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
