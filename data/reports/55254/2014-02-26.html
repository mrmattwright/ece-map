</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Village Kids Childcare Centre Napier provides all day education and care for 97 children, including 30 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review, 142 children are enrolled, and 42% are MƒÅori. Four teaching teams and specific spaces cater for different age groups.</p><p>The service is one of three privately owned centres operated by Village Kids in Hawke‚Äôs Bay.</p><p>There is a strong focus on building positive and responsive relationships with families and whƒÅnau. Consistent support is provided for children with additional learning needs. Transitions between rooms and on to school are a well managed priority.</p><p>Many staff have worked at the centre for a long period of time, including the centre manager. Two of the four head teachers have recently changed age levels and one is new to the role.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of the three Village Kids early childhood centres. These centres are associated with the Village Kids home-based care network, afterschool care programmes and play groups.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy provides clear expectations for how staff will work together to support children, families and whƒÅnau. There is a commitment to providing age specific care routines and resources. Parent aspirations are sought, and responded to, for infants and older children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported and enjoy an environment that caters well for their emerging interests. Younger children‚Äôs developing communication skills are actively encouraged and supported by good staff team work. There is a focus on providing nurturing and responsive care routines. Older children are involved in more sustained play and conversations with staff. Children enjoy cooperative play and friendships that contribute to a settled and calm centre environment.</p><p>The bicultural programme is at an early stage of development. The annual plan identifies that teachers need to develop their use of te reo MƒÅori and embed tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Profiles are attractive records of children‚Äôs ongoing learning and development. Daily planning focuses on noticing children‚Äôs interests and providing matching resources. Teachers should continue to strengthen the responsiveness of planning for individuals and the range of strategies to extend learning. This should include evaluating the effectiveness of teaching strategies.</p><p>There has been noticeable progress in developing more in-depth self review. Staff lead reviews that involve research and result in changes to centre practices. The transition-to-school review has contributed to a consistent focus on literacy and numeracy teaching and supporting resources. Teacher appraisal processes are becoming more thorough. The centre director, manager and head teachers should continue to strengthen the implementation of self review and staff appraisal to support ongoing improvement in the quality of teaching and professional leadership.</p><p>Village Kids management and owners continue to provide a robust policy and procedures framework, underpinned by a useful annual plan. It is timely to fine tune the goals in the strategic plan so that direction is more responsive to the specific needs of the centre. Planned property redevelopments reflect management‚Äôs commitment to providing children with spacious, free-flowing, age-appropriate learning environments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, staff and ERO agree on the following as key next steps:</p><ul>
<li>review and develop a centre-wide philosophy to establish a shared understanding and consistency of expectations for high quality education and care</li>
<li>further develop assessment and planning and evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching in extending individual learning</li>
<li>strengthen the bicultural programme, including teachers' use of te reo MƒÅori, culturally responsive practices and specific strategies to support success for MƒÅori children, as MƒÅori</li>
<li>strengthen professional leadership to support high quality teaching</li>
<li>continue to strengthen and embed understanding and use of self review and staff appraisal to support high quality teaching practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Village Kids Childcare Centre Napier completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Village Kids Childcare Centre Napier will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>26 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
