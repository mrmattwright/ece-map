</table><p>Panda Home Care is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pandas Home Care is a privately-owned, home-based early childhood care and education service that opened in 2015. It caters for a diverse range of cultures, including a large number of Chinese families throughout the Canterbury region.</p><p>The owner and an administrator work as interpreters for the Chinese educators and families that use the service. They work closely with two qualified and registered early childhood teachers, known as coordinators.</p><p>The manager, administrator and coordinators support the provision of care and education for infants, toddlers and young children in the child's own home with an educator. Care arrangements can also be made in the home of an educator. The home-based service offers families consistent, personalised caregiving for their children within a small group setting for up to four children, including a maximum of two children under two years of age.</p><p>The manager and coordinators have regularly reviewed the service philosophy to ensure it reflects their shared values, and provides a focus on inclusive, positive and respectful environments for children.</p><p>This is the first ERO review and report for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The manager, administrator and coordinators foster positive and inclusive relationships with children and families, and with educators. They model care and respect for one another and for their diverse learning community. The home language, culture and identity of children and families is highly valued and celebrated.</p><p>Coordinators promote the dual heritage of New Zealand. They work closely with educators to provide a bicultural curriculum for all children in ways that are respectful of the MƒÅori culture.</p><p>Coordinators use a wide range of strategies to ensure that parents are well informed and educators are effectively supported to provide for the wellbeing and learning of children. Targeted workshops and purposeful excursions are inclusive of educators, children, families and community.</p><p>Educators have ongoing professional advice and guidance from coordinators to help them understand and implement Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum, in ways that are meaningful for children. Coordinators and educators work together to document the interesting experiences provided to promote children's interests, strengths and capabilities.</p><p>The reflective and responsive leadership team have clear expectations for the provision of a quality service. They work collaboratively to develop useful systems and processes to guide the effective operation of the service and to provide quality assurance. The service priorities and associated goals align closely to the philosophy and to professional development. Coordinators are making increasingly good use of internal review that is focused on continuous improvement and results in considered changes to practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, coordinators and ERO agree that the key next steps for the service are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop appraisal processes for the manager and administration staff</li>
<li>further develop appraisal and attestation processes for coordinators and performance management systems for educators</li>
<li>explicitly focus on learning intentions and outcomes for children in assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>extend strategic planning to include annual actions to meet key service priorities and to evaluate the impact on outcomes for children</li>
<li>further develop coordinator visit records to better reflect the level of support provided.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pandas Home Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The service has a range of well-developed formal and informal systems for managing health and safety requirements. In order to improve current practice the service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>all educators hold a current first-aid certificate prior to caring for children</li>
<li>service excursions include risk management processes and parent authorisation of ratios.</li>
</ul><p>During the on-site stage of the review ERO gave emphasis to ensuring all aspects of the provision for sleeping children are followed.</p><p>Since the on-site stage of the review the service has updated the child protection policy, the first aid requirement procedure, the event plan and risk analysis process, and the hazard identification record sheet. A cyber safety procedure has also been developed.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pandas Home Care will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>18 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
