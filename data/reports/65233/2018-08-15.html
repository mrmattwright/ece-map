</table><p>Babyspace Ltd is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Babyspace Ltd is a privately-owned and operated centre located in Richmond, Nelson. It is licensed to offer full-day care and education for 18 children, including 17 children aged under two years. The owner, who is also a registered ECE teacher, is responsible for the day-to-day governance and management of the centre. She is supported by an assistant supervisor and two other senior experienced teachers with allocated responsibilities.</p><p>A high proportion of staff are trained and registered teachers. Staffing has remained very consistent over the last ten years.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is informed by Te WhƒÅriki and Te Tiritri o Waitangi principles and the Pikler philosophy. Emphasis is placed on supporting children to form secure relationships with a primary caregiver and to develop at their own pace.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review the owner has engaged external support to develop the appraisal system and to refine strategic planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have created a caring environment for children and their families. It is characterised by teachers who respond very effectively and respectfully to children's needs and interests and who incorporate whƒÅnau aspirations into planning and teaching. Teachers use a range of communication strategies to ensure that parents and family are informed and engaged in their children's learning. Transitions into the centre are well managed and tailored to the needs of individual children and their families. Staffing is thoughtfully managed to ensure that primary caregivers build relationships with children and their families, know children well, and are able to provide continuity and consistency of routines. These practices create a positive environment for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The curriculum is designed and implemented to engage infants, toddlers and young children. Teachers thoughtfully organise and use the centre's resources to promote children's freedom of movement, challenge, curiosity, creativity and self-management. They work alongside children, responding to emerging interests as well as offering suggestions to challenge and extend learning without unnecessary intervention. Teachers use language intelligently to empower children, to extend thinking, to encourage children to describe their feelings and to promote curiosity and confidence. The deliberate use of natural materials, reading resources that reflect te ao MƒÅori, and the use of te reo reflect the centre's value of bicultural practices and support the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor spaces are well designed to offer a very good range of activity and learning opportunities. They include areas for children to spend time quietly as well as to mix with other children. Landscaping makes the area attractive and interesting as well as providing physical challenge. There is a very good range of equipment available for children. An area is allocated for a garden and children are involved in growing produce which is shared with whƒÅnau.</p><p>Leadership is distributed and professional learning is valued. Teachers have opportunities to develop leadership skills and take responsibility for aspects of teaching and learning. Mentoring, feedback and discussion assists information sharing and professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Internal evaluation is an area that requires further development. The centre has adopted a useful framework for internal evaluation. It is timely for leaders to develop a professional learning plan that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extends teachers' knowledge and understanding about each phase of this evaluation framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develops the critical and evaluative thinking required to identify and document the impact of teaching strategies on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leadership capability to implement sustainable professional learning could be extended by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers with areas of responsibility to develop skills in implementing professional learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing action plans that clearly identify the expectations of professional learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the impact of these plans to identify the impact of professional learning in terms of sustainable practices and improved outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Babyspace Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Babyspace Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>15 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
