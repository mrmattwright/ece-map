</table><p>BestStart Welcome Bay¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Welcome Bay is situated in Welcome Bay, Tauranga and is licensed for 50 children, including 14 children up to the age of two years. At the time of this review, 57 children were enrolled and 19 are MƒÅori. There has been a small decline in the centre roll since the January 2016 ERO report. The purpose-built centre provides all-day education and care in two age-based rooms.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that 'each child is respected and empowered as a unique individual'. Teachers recognise that all children learn at their own pace and through many different avenues, including play, first-hand experiences, modelling, imitation and interactions with adults and the environment.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the centre has had a name change from TopKids Welcome Bay Rd, to BestStart Welcome Bay. The development of a new leadership structure has included the appointment of a new centre manager and assistant manager. A professional service manager and business manager provide support for the centre.</p><p>This service is operated by BestStart, a charitable organisation owned by the Wright Family Foundation. Since the previous ERO report, a new chief executive officer has been appointed. Regional and local professional service and business managers oversee the Central North Island BestStart centres. Their vision is to work with families, whƒÅnau, teacher and communities to enable children to achieve their learning potential.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of 15 in the BestStart organisation.</p><p>The centre belongs to the Tauranga Peninsula KƒÅhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The importance of children learning through play is recognised and valued by teachers. Reference to children's individual development goals is strengthening teachers' planning and assessment practices to support learning. Curriculum areas of play are well resourced. Teachers foster children's independence, social skills and respond to their interests. Centre managers express a continued focus on promoting children's emotional competency in the programme. ERO's evaluation affirms this ongoing priority.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported in an inclusive environment. Teachers know and respond to their specific needs. Plans and strategies are developed with whƒÅnau, parents and external agencies. Successful transitions are individualised and well supported by effective partnerships between families and teachers. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions into and within the service.</p><p>Teacher are attentive and respond to the needs and rhythms of children up to two years of age. Relationships are respectful and responsive. Children easily access an environment that is well resourced and encourages their exploration.</p><p>The new leadership team, in supporting the new teaching team, provides clear direction for the centre. They are developing shared expectations for the education and care of children. Ongoing review is leading to evidence-based decisions. Professional learning development supports teachers' growth and development. Building teacher capability and strengthening the partnership with parents and whƒÅnau contributes to positive outcomes for children across the centre. Leaders have established reciprocal and meaningful links with NgƒÅi Te Rangi iwi to support success for MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Strong systems and processes guide centre operation. Internal evaluation is improvement focused and includes ongoing consultation with families and whƒÅnau. There is clear alignment between regional strategic direction and centre annual plans. The appraisal process assists teachers to inquire into and strengthen their practice. This process is supported by regular and ongoing coaching and mentoring. Several initiatives to remove barriers to education and support children's wellness, promotes equity in learning opportunities. The organisation's philosophy, vision and goals promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen in-depth learning conversations and open-ended questioning to extend children‚Äôs thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build on the use and understanding of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori within the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Welcome Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>31 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
