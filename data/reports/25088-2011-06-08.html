<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Akoteu Falemaama Pre-school is affiliated to the Tongan Methodist Church. Since ERO‚Äôs first review of the centre in 2008, a licence change has allowed the centre to cater for an additional 20 children. The successful promotion of the centre in the church and the local community has resulted in these additional spaces being readily filled.</p><p>The promotion of Tongan language and culture and the Christian character of the centre are clearly evident. There is a positive tone in the centre, with children and adults interacting happily. Children develop and learn through good opportunities to engage in play of their choice. Some flexibility within daily routines caters for individual preferences.</p><p>Centre managers continue to implement good management practices and centre development based on self review. Their regular consideration of the mission and vision for the centre results in thorough strategic planning that is enacted through annual plans. The implementation of more collaborative processes of self review would now allow staff and parents a greater contribution to centre development.</p><p>Management have successfully focused on increasing the number of staff qualified in early childhood education and encouraging these staff to attain even higher education qualifications. Managers have now turned their focus to supporting those staff in training or about to undertake training. In order to provide clarity and transparency, managers should now clearly define and document all personnel roles within the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Akoteu Falemaama Pre-school was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAkoteu Falemaama Pre-school.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>In 2008, ERO reviewed the centre for the first time. The 2008 ERO report acknowledged that children were confident learners who were settled and engaged in the programme. Adults‚Äô interactions with children were warm and respectful, and there was a high level of use of Tongan language. ERO also commented on the strong leadership in the centre and the effective management practices that had been established.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Positive outcomes for children.</em> Children continue to be confident participators in the programme. Long periods for sustained play support their learning and engagement. Children are familiar with daily routines and older children have some opportunities to be leaders at these times. Staff are caring and responsive as they work at children‚Äôs level and become involved in play.</p><p><em>Tongan language and culture.</em> Routines, resources and teaching practices reflect the centre‚Äôs vision to promote and maintain Tongan language and culture. Staff generally use Tongan language as they talk with children and each other. A specific policy on language use could now provide more clarity about the expected level of Tongan language.</p><p><em>Physical environment.</em> Children have easy access to a good selection of equipment, activities and resources. A recent focus on enhancing resources and creating an attractive environment has been successful. Wall space is well used to display children‚Äôs creative art, photographs and records of their learning. The Tongan character of the preschool and New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage are prominent in the environment.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Programme improvement.</em> The supervisor and staff should improve some aspects of the programme and their practices in order to enhance outcomes for children. They could:</p><ul>
<li>develop children‚Äôs creativity by minimising the use of templates and worksheets;</li>
<li>continue to integrate opportunities for literacy and numeracy learning through play; and</li>
<li>consider changing meal-time routines in light of roll growth and the size of the dining area.</li>
</ul><p><em>Increasing transparency.</em> Centre management should continue to develop management practices that meet the principle of partnership outlined in the centre‚Äôs charter. To achieve this they need to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify and document roles and responsibilities and job descriptions for all personnel in the centre;</li>
<li>implement more consultative and collaborative self-review practices;</li>
<li>review and rationalise the centre‚Äôs policy base in preparation for relicensing under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations; and</li>
<li>extend the complaints policy to incorporate general complaints and include the Ministry of Education as the final step.</li>
</ul><p><em>Staff appraisal.</em> The performance appraisal process for staff could be further developed. Specific goals about supporting and extending children‚Äôs learning could be specified and effective feedback given to teachers about areas for development. Input from an experienced early childhood centre manager could provide a valuable contribution to the supervisor‚Äôs appraisal.</p><p><em>Programme management.</em> Some good assessment practices are evident but the programme remains teacher driven and activity based. Planning should be based on individual children‚Äôs current and emerging interests. It would be useful to use planned professional development during 2011 to increase staff skills in programme planning, and to develop programme management processes that reflect a change of emphasis.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau, particularly when the child and whƒÅnau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>A small number of MƒÅori children attend the centre.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Centre practices help to ensure that MƒÅori parents/whƒÅnau feel welcome. On enrolment, aspirations for their child‚Äôs learning are sought and staff ensure they are familiar with the iwi affiliations of whƒÅnau. Ongoing discussions with MƒÅori parents help staff to identify ways to reflect language and culture in the programme and whƒÅnau have shared resources to support centre staff. As a result, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are naturally included in the programme and resources are reflective of both the traditional and modern MƒÅori worlds.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Akoteu Falemaama Pre-school completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ul>
<li>use the hazard identification process to better effect; and</li>
<li>ensure staff model healthy eating practices for children.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance. In order to address these, centre managers must:</p><ol>
<li>ensure that entrance gates and doors are always shut so that children are unable to leave the centre without the knowledge of a staff member, Source: <em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 1998 R17 (4), R24 (l)]</em></li>
<li>urgently renew the safe fall beneath the climbing structure and ensure that climbing equipment placed on grass does not exceed 1 metre in height,¬†<em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 1998 R17 (1), R24 (1a),(4)].</em></li>
</ol><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that managers should:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>define and document roles and responsibilities for all centre personnel; and</p>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-akoteu-falemaama-pre-school" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Akoteu Falemaama Pre-school</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office‚Äôs latest report on Akoteu Falemaama Pre-school.</p><p>Akoteu Falemaama Pre-school is affiliated to the Tongan Methodist Church. Since ERO‚Äôs first review of the centre in 2008, a licence change has allowed the centre to cater for an additional 20 children. The successful promotion of the centre in the church and the local community has resulted in these additional spaces being readily filled.</p><p>The promotion of Tongan language and culture and the Christian character of the centre are clearly evident. There is a positive tone in the centre, with children and adults interacting happily. Children develop and learn through good opportunities to engage in play of their choice. Some flexibility within daily routines caters for individual preferences.</p><p>Centre managers continue to implement good management practices and centre development based on self review. Their regular consideration of the mission and vision for the centre results in thorough strategic planning that is enacted through annual plans. The implementation of more collaborative processes of self review would now allow staff and parents a greater contribution to centre development.</p><p>Management have successfully focused on increasing the number of staff qualified in early childhood education and encouraging these staff to attain even higher education qualifications. Managers have now turned their focus to supporting those staff in training or about to undertake training. In order to provide clarity and transparency, managers should now clearly define and document all personnel roles within the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre‚Äôs self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> ‚Äì including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> ‚Äì other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> ‚Äì This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> ‚Äì assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
