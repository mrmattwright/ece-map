</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pā Harakeke Kōhungahunga is located in Opotiki. The roll consists of predominantly Māori children that whakapapa to Whakatōhea. The centre operates under an all day licence, currently finishing at 2.30 pm. The He Kakano area caters for children under two years of age and the Puawai area caters for children over two years of age. There is an emphasis on employing qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The centre is owned and governed by the Whakatōhea Māori Trust Board who represent the iwi. The Trust also owns Te Aria Toka early childhood centre. The Trust’s vision is <em>Ko te kai hoki i waiaua</em> (the food bowl of the Waiaua River). The Trust’s education philosophy is <em>Ma te tamaiti e paihere nga ahuatanga o te ao tawhito nga ahuatanga o tenei ao</em> (the child is the link between the past and the future, fostering an emphasis on knowledge of their ancestry, with learning focused on what the children and their whānau bring with them to the centre).</p><p>The centre has been under new ownership and management since the beginning of 2013. There is a new leadership team supported by both new and continuing staff. The centre works closely with staff from Te Aria Toka to support centre development and there have been a number of staff transfers between the centres during this year.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>High-quality interactions are evident throughout the programme. Teachers know children and their parents and whānau well. There is a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships with parents, grandparents and the wider community. Teachers continually respond to children’s individual learning and development needs. They emphasise positive guidance and establish respectful relationships with children. They use open questions to challenge children’s thinking and encourage them to solve problems.</p><p>Learning environments in both areas are attractive, well resourced and educationally stimulating. Children’s work is celebrated and their learning is made visible in colourful wall displays. Spacious outdoor play areas provide many opportunities for physical challenges, social play and gardening. Te reo and tikanga Māori, literacy and mathematics learning are effectively integrated within the programme and environment. Mihimihi, pepeha and karakia are a strong and prominent feature. There is also a strong focus on whanaungatanga and incorporating parents’ aspirations in the programme. Topics of interest in Puawai include excursions into the local community. Babies in He Kakano enjoy a secure and supportive emotional environment where they receive respectful, nurturing care that incorporates a wide range of activities. There is a settled, calm and positive tone throughout the centre.</p><p>Teachers use their strengths to implement a varied curriculum, based on children’s observed interests and some community-based topics. Collective planning enables teachers to extend children’s learning. Staff have developed positive relationships with local schools and actively support children to transition comfortably to new entrant classrooms. Centre leaders have identified that a next step is to more deliberately incorporate Ngāti Whakatōhea tikanga and place names into the programme. </p><p>Assessment practices capture children’s learning and record the breadth of their participation in the programme. Centre leaders recognise the need to record strategies which extend children’s learning and to demonstrate their progress over time.</p><p>The centre manager provides strong and enthusiastic leadership. With team leaders and teachers she is building a centre-wide culture and management systems, which promote positive outcomes for children. The Trust provides active support for the centre and generous funding for resources and professional development. It also provides sound strategic direction that includes increasing community participation in early childhood education.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre manager agree that priorities for further development are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop an annual plan that is aligned to the strategic objectives of the trust and provides direction for further development of teaching and learning in the centre</li>
<li>continue the development of performance management systems, including staff appraisal</li>
<li>establish a framework for self review, focused on positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pa Harakeke Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pa Harakeke Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>16 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
