</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tots on the Rock provides education and care for children and families from the local Waiheke community. It is licenSed for 35 children, including 10 children up to two years of age. It operates from a purpose-built facility close to the main shopping area. Most children are Pākehā, with small numbers of Māori children and some children from other cultural backgrounds. Staff include teachers of Argentinian and Māori heritage who willingly share their cultural and language backgrounds with children and their families.</p><p>The centre's organisation and resources cater very well for children. Babies and toddlers have separate indoor and outdoor play areas. They have regular contact with older siblings and other children during the day. All children are provided with healthy and nutritious meals and snacks. The owners have extended the outside deck, doubling the outdoor space for children. The outside areas are well covered and provide all-weather play opportunities.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes inclusive and collaborative approaches with whānau, and celebrates the bicultural status of Aotearoa New Zealand. It also promotes respectful and nurturing practices with children and incorporates environmental sustainability within the daily programme.</p><p>The centre continues to be owned and operated as a family business. The owners manage the daily running of the centre while the centre manager, an experienced early childhood educator, leads the teaching team. An experienced and qualified team of teachers lead the programmes for babies and toddlers and older children. They are well supported by a mix of qualified and unqualified teachers.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report was the first for this centre. It noted the positive and affirming interactions between teachers and children and the good quality learning programmes. The owners, manager and teachers have used ERO's external evaluation well, and have made good progress with all of the next steps identified in the 2014 report.</p><p>Since 2014, leaders and teachers have undertaken professional learning and support to improve practices at all levels of the centre, and to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides high quality learning environments for children. Children are warmly welcomed by teachers at the start of the day are content and well settled. Older children are free to choose from varied activities in the indoor and outdoor areas and have good access to resources and equipment they need for their play and learning. They play collaboratively together, or individually as they prefer. Children are kind to each other and enjoy opportunities to play and learn with younger children. They experience positive interactions with their teachers.</p><p>Parents are comfortable in the centre. They appreciate the inclusive and community-focused approaches of the owners and staff, and value how well staff communicate with them about their children's care and learning. As a result of these and other good practices, children and their families have a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Children benefit from a high quality programme. Teachers' relaxed and flexible approach provides children with good opportunities for uninterrupted play, and with the time and space required for them to problem solve and think critically. The unhurried pace supports children to work in their own way. Teachers recognise and plan well for the role they play in enhancing children's learning outcomes.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are particularly well served in the centre. Teachers promote respectful caregiving practices with babies and toddlers, following routines established at home. They also maintain good communication with parents. Younger children experience affectionate and nurturing approaches, including opportunities to explore independently alongside older children.</p><p>Teaching practices are sound. Teachers value and have good knowledge of children's individual interests, strengths and characteristics. Children's learning stories are used to plan for individual learning opportunities. Teachers skilfully use the 'notice, recognise and respond' approach to promote children's emerging and longer term interests. They encourage a curriculum that integrates literacy, numeracy and life science, and provideS children with ample opportunities for messy and imaginative play.</p><p>In line with the centre philosophy, teachers are continually designing learning programmes based around biculturalism and sustainability. Older children especially enjoy frequent trips out of the centre. Here they have good opportunities to connect with the local community and to contribute as kaitiaki to the Waiheke environment.</p><p>The owners and centre manager work collaboratively to promote positive professional leadership for the teaching team. The owner's commitment to improvement includes the ongoing employment of a specialist early childhood facilitator to support and guide management practices and systems. This is helping to build teacher and leadership capability, and contributes to promoting sustainable practices and relational trust throughout the centre.</p><p>Strategic planning and self-review are well understood, and meaningfully aligned to teachers' appraisals and professional learning. The appraisal process encourages teachers to inquire into and critique their professional practice. This reflective process includes a continual focus on improving teachers' bicultural practice and ensuring positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that a useful next step would be to extend teachers' and leaders' evaluation of the role that the teacher plays in promoting children's learning. This would link well to the centre's self-identified next step of enhancing leadership opportunities throughout the centre, and strengthening sustainable practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tots on the Rock completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Tots on the Rock will be in four years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>7 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
