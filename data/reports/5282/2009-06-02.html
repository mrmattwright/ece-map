<a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Onekawa Kindergarten is one of fifteen reviewed under the umbrella organisation of the Napier Kindergarten Association (the association).&nbsp; The association provides clear policies and procedures for centre management and teaching practice.&nbsp; The kindergarten offers education and care for five morning and three afternoon sessions, for up to sixty children over two years of age.&nbsp; The kindergarten has recently diversified its hours of operation in consultation with the community.&nbsp; This report should be read in conjunction with the association report.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers&rsquo; commitment to developing wider community partnerships is reflected in the centre philosophy.&nbsp; Staff recognise that positive relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau assist them to support children in their learning.&nbsp; Relationships with families are warm and affirming.&nbsp; Teachers have a clear vision for the centre.&nbsp; They successfully engage parents in their children&rsquo;s learning through one-to-one conversations, newsletters, planning boards and profiles.&nbsp; Parents share valuable information with teachers about their children.&nbsp; Teachers and children have meaningful conversations about family life and the wider world.</p>
<p class="ReportText">High quality, systematic self review forms the basis for teachers&rsquo; decisions about children&rsquo;s education and care at the kindergarten.&nbsp; Robust self review leads to ongoing improvements to teaching practice and children&rsquo;s learning outcomes.&nbsp; Children engage in meaningful learning experiences directly related to their interests.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers successfully use a variety of assessment methods to evaluate children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; Teachers observe, discuss and, based on emergent interest, plan for individual and groups of children.&nbsp; Opportunities for children to plan for their learning through a project approach are available.&nbsp; Children work individually with teachers to set their goals and understand their learning outcomes.&nbsp; Wh&#257;nau are involved in initial and subsequent stages, and contribute their voice to learning stories.&nbsp; Teachers support children as they develop their ideas over extended periods of time.&nbsp; Profiles document children&rsquo;s different interests and skill development.&nbsp; Children and their families value these records of learning and development.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The head teacher provides inclusive, collaborative, professional leadership.&nbsp; Teachers work effectively as a team to provide programmes for children.&nbsp; Staff are responsive to professional learning and demonstrate a commitment to improving the environment and providing enhanced learning outcomes for children.&nbsp; Teachers work collegially for the benefit of children and their parents.</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<a id="3-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of Onekawa Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atOnekawa Kindergarten.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3 class="ReportText">The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The March 2006 ERO report identified the need for teachers to further extend and provide for children&rsquo;s opportunities to develop knowledge and understanding of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.&nbsp; Centre staff sought external guidance and support to develop further knowledge in this area.&nbsp; Teachers are confident that their planned professional development will continue to build their ability to further use te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Self review<br> High quality self review underpins decisions teachers make about children&rsquo;s education and care.&nbsp; Teachers evaluate the effectiveness of what they do to improve outcomes for children.&nbsp; Staff respond to shifts in emphasis generated by children in large group learning.&nbsp; They regularly review curriculum areas, policies and procedures, children&rsquo;s areas of interest and parent/wh&#257;nau communication and involvement. &nbsp;Teachers have successfully reviewed their practice in promoting te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.&nbsp; They have increased the use of te reo M&#257;ori, waiata, culturally significant artefacts, and books and puzzles.&nbsp; Children and their families experience enhanced learning opportunities through improved provision for teaching and learning.</li>
<li>Literacy, numeracy and science<br> Teachers provide opportunities for children to incorporate numeracy and science language in their learning.&nbsp; Books, writing materials, science equipment and the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) provide a sound base for children to develop their knowledge of literacy, numeracy and science concepts in meaningful ways.&nbsp; Children prepared and maintained a garden and worm farm as part of their environment studies.&nbsp; Through individual exploration and group sessions children enhance their literacy, numeracy and science skills in the context of play.</li>
<li>Use of ICT<br> Teachers support children to make effective use of ICT.&nbsp; This use includes support for children&rsquo;s investigations and slide shows to share learning with their parents.&nbsp; Children initiate their own use of ICT. &nbsp;They are familiar with using laptops, an electronic microscope, a digital camera and a data projector to revisit their work.&nbsp; Children use ICT to extend the exploration of their interests.</li>
<li>Self-directed learning<br> Children lead their learning.&nbsp; Adults follow and support children in their chosen areas of interest.&nbsp; The project approach allows children to set their goals and understand what they will be learning.&nbsp; Children can work on their projects for an extended period of time, one to one with a teacher.&nbsp; Teachers give feedback to children constantly, helping them to understand their learning outcomes.&nbsp; Children develop as confident, creative, self-motivated learners.</li>
<li>Children&rsquo;s profiles<br> Teachers effectively assess through observations and regular discussion, and record children&rsquo;s learning in profiles.&nbsp; The information contained in these profiles is meaningful and relevant, with direct links to Te Wh&#257;riki.&nbsp; Profiles clearly reflect the different interests and skills of individual children over time.&nbsp; Additional data in the form of annotated photographs, and child and parent voice, contribute valuable information and provides a clear record of children&rsquo;s learning and development.&nbsp; Children revisit prior learning through profiles and enjoy sharing their progress with parents and wh&#257;nau.</li>
<li>Children&rsquo;s self assessment<br> Children effectively evaluate their individual and group learning in summary comments related to learning stories and art work.&nbsp; Teachers work hard to record oral assessments so that children learn how to reflect on their own learning.&nbsp; Group interests are reflected in learning books that include examples of children&rsquo;s reflection of their own learning.&nbsp; Through participation in assessment children develop as competent communicators.</li>
<li>Caring interactions<br> Teachers interact with children in caring, respectful and affirming ways.&nbsp; They listen and respond to children&rsquo;s conversations and accept their contributions.&nbsp; The high adult-to-child ratio provides many opportunities for children to experience extended conversations with teachers.&nbsp; Children interact easily with teachers and peers and approach adults confidently.&nbsp; Teachers model strategies to assist children to problem solve, and negotiate differences when they arise.&nbsp; Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</li>
<li>Parent partnerships<br> Teachers value the input of children and their families through focusing on their inclusion in the life of the kindergarten.&nbsp; Teachers get to know of parental aspirations for their children on enrolment.&nbsp; Staff continue to keep parents informed about the learning programme, using displays, newsletters and individual discussion.&nbsp; Recent changes in centre operations reflect parent and wh&#257;nau preferences, and are the result of planned consultation with the community.&nbsp; An active committee supports the kindergarten in resourcing and planning for further developments.&nbsp; Families and staff have a close working relationship that benefits children.</li>
<li>Learning environment<br> The enjoyment teachers demonstrate in working with children at the centre contributes to a positive environment conducive to learning.&nbsp; The atmosphere is calm and purposeful.&nbsp; The environment is well organised and high quality resources are thoughtfully prepared to prompt children&rsquo;s curiosity as they explore their interests.&nbsp; Displays reflect children&rsquo;s learning and interests, and staff provide visual information that children can use in their learning.&nbsp; Spacious play areas offer a variety of centres of interest, and places where children can work independently or in groups.&nbsp; The flow between the indoor and outdoor areas allows children to enjoy uninterrupted play.</li>
<li>Team work<br> The head teacher provides inclusive and affirming leadership of the centre.&nbsp; She is consultative, and with her team has a clear vision for the direction of the centre.&nbsp; Teachers work effectively together, drawing on their strengths and professional knowledge.&nbsp; They respond positively to professional learning and focus on providing the best possible learning environment for children to achieve to their potential.&nbsp; A teacher aide provides practical support during sessions.&nbsp; Staff model constructive relationships for parents and children.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area for improvement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing review<br> To maintain and extend good practice, staff should, through ongoing review, continue to determine the extent to which children use ICT and assessment to support their learning.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-areas-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Areas of National Interest</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports.&nbsp; This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>M&#257;ori Children</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children and focuses on the potential of M&#257;ori children to develop as competent and capable learners.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consultation with wh&#257;nau<br> Centre staff have effective processes for identifying and responding to the aspirations and expectations of parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.&nbsp; Parent and wh&#257;nau hopes and expectations for the care and education of their children are discussed on enrolment.&nbsp; Teachers take every opportunity to ensure learning experiences respond to the aspirations of parents of M&#257;ori children.</li>
<li>Culturally valuing<br> The centre&rsquo;s environment strongly reflects te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori, with taonga, learning stories and other resources that affirm the culture and language of M&#257;ori children and their families.&nbsp; A feature of the centre is the importance placed on respecting and enhancing the culture and language of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau.&nbsp; Teachers value and enjoy learning about M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s whakapapa and experiences they bring to learning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Assessment of learning<br> Teachers successfully use M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s cultural context as the basis for assessments of their learning.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s profiles contain learning stories that incorporate their wh&#257;nau activities and celebrations.&nbsp; The profiles provide important links with home and wh&#257;nau, and demonstrate the value teachers place on M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s culture in learning.</li>
<li>Parent involvement<br> Teachers actively work with parents of M&#257;ori children to enhance learning partnerships.&nbsp; Parents&rsquo; knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is valued as part of the learning programme.&nbsp; Teachers see parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children as an important and integral resource.&nbsp; Children benefit from responsive and reciprocal relationships evident between home and kindergarten.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the licensee and staff of Onekawa Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s investigations did not identify any areas of concern.</p>
<a id="6-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Recommendations</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO and the centre management agreed that:</p>
<p class="Recommendation">6.1 teachers, through their existing robust review processes and knowledge of children&rsquo;s interests, continue to refine and enhance centre practices in partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
