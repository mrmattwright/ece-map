</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leamington Playcentre is an early childhood service run by a parent cooperative and operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA). It is situated in the western area of Cambridge in well-established, attractive and spacious grounds. The centre runs three sessions a week for children from birth to school age, and hosts the Supporting Parents Alongside Children Education (SPACE) programme for a further two days a week.</p><p>The playcentre is licensed for 30 children with a maximum of 15 under two years of age. The current roll is 13 and 5 who are Māori. A number of new families have enrolled in the playcentre since the Roto-o-Rangi playcentre ceased operating. A strategic priority for the playcentre is to increase the number of children and families enrolled.</p><p>Centre leadership is provided by a president, treasurer and secretary, all of whom are parents. The WPA's Centre Support Worker (CSW) visits the centre on a regular basis, and provides valued support for the work of parents as they coordinate the programme for children and manage playcentre operations.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the WPA continue to provide effective governance, strategic direction, management support and adult education programmes for the centre. This support and training is underpinned by the WPA philosophy 'Whānau tupu ngātahi - families growing together'.</p><p>The association’s strategic commitment to te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident in its bicultural leadership model. High value is placed on productive partnerships with Māori whānau, and funding is made available for related professional development. The association’s commitment to <em>Ka Hikitia</em> has resulted in clear expectations for continuing to build members’ understanding, confidence and competence in te ao Māori.</p><p>The playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO and effectively responded to areas for development identified in the 2013 report:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>adding richness and complexity to the programme by strengthening the use of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporation of te reo and tikanga Māori in all aspects of the programme and resources.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This review was part of a cluster of 8 playcentre reviews in the Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau are made to feel welcome as valued members of a family-based community. They both enjoy warm, affirming and supportive relationships in the playcentre, where manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are highly evident. Children are encouraged to initiate their own play and follow their interests. They have ongoing access to a wide range of high quality resources in both the indoor and outdoor play areas, and this promotes extended periods of uninterrupted play.</p><p>Children benefit from a broad range of learning experiences. The outdoor play areas include extensive native bush plantings and mature trees that invite exploration and provide many opportunities to learn about the natural world. There are many opportunities for problem solving and physical challenges that promote risk-taking in a safe environment. Positive attitudes to physical activity are continually promoted. Children are encouraged to initiate artistic, dramatic and creative play. Early mathematical language and concepts are supported through manipulative activities such as puzzles, cooking and sand-pit play.</p><p>A feature of the playcentre is the high ratio of involved whānau committed to sharing early childhood experiences with their children. This ensures children enjoy high quality interactions, which includes rich oral language and the sharing of stories. The use of te reo and tikanga Māori practices was evident. Adults take a communal approach to responding to the physical and emotional needs of all children. They are responsive to individual needs and rhythms of children especially babies and toddlers who are able to play and explore alongside their whānau.</p><p>Adults are encouraged to participate in the playcentre education programme, which empowers them to be well-informed, first educators of their children. They encourage and model healthy eating and nutrition for children. A recent initiative is for adults to record their observations of individual children on wall displays. A current self-review focus is to document children's development in a meaningful way in individual learning stories. This supports new parents to identify and plan for their children's learning. Adults recognise the potential to further enhance learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Leadership of the programme and operations is shared by the whānau cooperative. This provides a rich variety of challenging and worthwhile experiences for the adults involved, who receive both encouragement and professional support from the association. Leaders promote and model healthy nutrition and positive attitudes to physical activity, which reflects an holistic approach to wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The CSW and centre members recognise that strengthening the processes for the planning and evaluation of sessions should further enhance learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre members acknowledge that continuing to promote the benefits of this cooperative early childhood service in the community is likely to attract and retain new members and contribute to the centre's viability and sustainability.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leamington Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, the WPA should strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the appraisal process to meet required standards.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Leamington Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>10 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are: </p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education </li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
