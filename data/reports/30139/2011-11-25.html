<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Footsteps Education Limited is a national home-based education and care provider with networks of various sizes throughout the country. The service employs regional leaders and visiting teachers to provide support for children and caregivers.</p><p>Some of the common features of the service include:</p><ul>
<li>the wide variety of care arrangements in place for children</li>
<li>the large numbers of children (up to 50%) that are in the care of social agencies</li>
<li>the significant number of enrolled children in some networks who are M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p>Footsteps Education has links with agencies involved with the families and the children in their care. This includes the Child Youth and Family Service. Many children attend other early childhood education (ECE) services in their local community.</p><p>There is a national leadership structure and an extensive range of documents to support the delivery of their services. Communication and professional development involves the wide use of information and communication technologies.</p><p>This network covers Christchurch, North and South Canterbury and the Central Otago regions. In the Christchurch area children, families, caregivers and teachers have been managing the impact of earthquakes.</p><p>Particular strengths of this network include:</p><ul>
<li>the way teachers support caregivers to build on children&rsquo;s interests to extend their learning and development</li>
<li>the use of effective teaching practices and the range of resources to support children and caregivers, including well-documented assessments</li>
<li>the overall quality of relationships and interactions between teachers, children and caregivers.</li>
</ul><p>The most significant areas for review and development include:</p><ul>
<li>refining aspects of assessment practices</li>
<li>building on initiatives to support parents and caregivers</li>
<li>extending aspects of self review and improving environmental safety.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Footsteps Education Ltd was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the network to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the network (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Footsteps Education Ltd.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The services provided by Footsteps Education staff focus on monthly visits to children and their caregivers. These visits incorporate discussions with, and feedback from, caregivers, and interactions with children. Further contact happens through telephone conversations between visits.</p><p>Detailed and well-presented assessments are completed and then sent to caregivers following the visit. These assessments include suggestions about resources and ideas to guide the child&rsquo;s future learning.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Programme</h4><p>Children&rsquo;s individual programmes successfully build on their interests and day-to-day experiences. Teachers make good use of their interactions with children, discussions with caregivers and the documents caregivers complete to determine how best to support caregivers and children.</p><p>Significant recent initiatives in Footsteps are supporting teachers to extend their ability to incorporate aspects of biculturalism into their practices and children&rsquo;s programmes.</p><h4>Teaching practices</h4><p>ERO observed most teachers using a variety of effective teaching strategies. For example, they:</p><ul>
<li>maintained a strong focus on supporting children&rsquo;s learning and development when working with them and their caregivers</li>
<li>modelled ways of interacting with children and using resources to extend their ideas and interests</li>
<li>helped caregivers to understand the significance of actions and activities in building on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><h4>Assessment</h4><p>Regular assessments help teachers and caregivers notice and recognise children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers put significant time and effort into children&rsquo;s learning journal entries which are attractive, informative and well presented. Children enjoy looking at their learning journals and were observed referring back to these during the on-site stage of the review.</p><h4>Relationships and interactions</h4><p>The overall quality of relationships and interactions between teachers, children and caregivers is good.</p><p>Features of the interactions and relationships evident during review visits include:</p><ul>
<li>caregivers who were responsive and affirming of children</li>
<li>the way teachers were supportive and respectful of children and children&rsquo;s eagerness to interact with them</li>
<li>teachers who had supportive and responsive relationships with caregivers</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; sensitivity to the complex situations of some children and their families.</li>
</ul><h4>Resources</h4><p>Children benefit from the strong focus that teachers place on providing a wide range of resources that help to build on their interests. Teachers use these well to add to resources caregivers already provide to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Teachers encourage caregivers to use the immediate environment and learning experiences available in the wider community.</p><h4>Community links</h4><p>Teachers and regional leaders are extending links with other agencies and organisations to support them in their work and those they work with. This is particularly evident in the efforts to establish effective working relationships with children&rsquo;s social workers.</p><h4>Management</h4><h4>Operational Framework</h4><p>Footsteps Education has an extensive range of policies, guidelines and procedures that help to clarify expectations and promote consistency in the way the service operates.</p><p>Staff benefit from the opportunities they have for professional development and support. Teachers get regular feedback from regional leaders. Appraisal practices are well established. Staff use a variety of ways of sharing ideas, including at regional and national meetings.</p><h3>Areas for review and development</h3><h4>Refining aspects of assessment practices</h4><p>The quality and usefulness of assessments could be enhanced through:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to increase the input of caregivers, and parents in contributing to and undertaking children&rsquo;s assessments</li>
<li>building on the good links already established with some ECE services that children attend to provide continuity in their learning</li>
<li>providing clearer links between children&rsquo;s past and current learning</li>
<li>making sure that the next steps in children&rsquo;s assessment records focus more clearly on learning.</li>
</ul><h4>Building on self review</h4><p>National leaders have developed an ongoing programme of self review. This has a strong focus on evaluating Footsteps Education guidelines, policies and procedures.</p><p>The next step is to build on this programme and place greater focus on evaluating:</p><ul>
<li>the impact of its services on children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>the quality of the educational programmes</li>
<li>the effectiveness of support for parents and guardians</li>
<li>the quality of working relationships with others involved with children and their families such as other agencies and ECE services that children attend.</li>
</ul><h4>Extending support</h4><p>Regional leaders and teachers have identified areas where their support for parents, caregivers and children could be extended. The next steps for the service are to implement and build on planned initiatives to further support children, caregivers and parents.</p><p>These steps also include the development of training modules for caregivers and identifying and informing caregivers about community-based professional development opportunities.</p><h4>Environmental safety</h4><p>ERO observed significant variation in the nature and quality of the environments children were provided with and caregivers work in. Some environments had better provisions for ensuring children&rsquo;s safety than others. Priority needs to be given to addressing the areas outlined as actions in the Management Assurance on Legal Requirements section of this report.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p>As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>Footsteps Education philosophy focuses on meeting the needs of all children, but in particular those children and families who face significant challenges. There is a commitment from teachers and staff to ensure that they are inclusive and welcoming. Teachers have a range of ways they communicate and share information with parents and caregivers about children.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Relationships and links with agencies</h4><p>Footsteps Education has established some useful relationships with agencies in the community who are able to support the service with children who have moderate to severe special needs. This includes links with education services and social agencies. Where appropriate, children&rsquo;s progress, and achievements are shared between Footsteps staff and other people with key responsibilities for children.</p><h4>Support initiatives</h4><p>Footsteps Education has good processes in place that support them in transitioning of children and families into the service. A formal initial visit provides useful information for caregivers and teachers that helps them to meet children&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>Additional support and visits are also available to children and families during the transition into the service if required.</p><p>In several instances, Footsteps Education managers report that they have funded extra support for children with significant learning and behavioural needs to help them successfully transition to school.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Footsteps Education Ltd completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>The Centre Management Assurance Statement completed by the Footsteps Education licensee and director indicated that health and safety obligations were being met across the networks.</p><p>Footsteps has a range of documents and procedures that focus on meeting the health and safety requirements outlined in the Home-Based Care Order 1992.</p><p>During the review, ERO identified some health and safety issues in most homes that were non-compliant with the Home-Based Care Order.</p><p>In order to address these, the licensee must ensure that:</p><p>4.1. every swimming pool capable of holding water on the premises where children are receiving home-based care must be secured against entry by children in the manner prescribed by the Fencing of Swimming Pools Act 1987&nbsp;<em>(31) Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992</em></p><p>4.2. hazards to the safety of the children in the premises where the children are receiving home-based care are corrected, repaired, removed, or made inaccessible to children&nbsp;<em>(4) Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992</em></p><p>4.3. furniture and resources in the premises where the children are receiving home-based care are secure so that they cannot cause damage during an earthquake (The premises must have adequate safeguards against earthquake.)&nbsp;<em>(15) Education (Home-Based Care) Order1992</em></p><p>4.4. each premises where the children are receiving home-based care must have a written plan for the evacuation and education and care of children in emergencies&nbsp;<em>(28) Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992</em></p><p>4.5. details of medicine (whether prescription or non-prescription) given to the child, of the days and times when it was given, and on whose authority and by whom it was given must be recorded&nbsp;<em>(35(g)) Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992</em></p><p>4.6.outdoor doors, fences and gates of the premises where children are receiving home-based care must be so provided and maintained that children cannot leave the premises without the caregiver&rsquo;s help.&nbsp;<em>(30) Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992</em></p><p>Teachers with regional leader support have been responsive in working towards addressing these concerns.</p><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO, in consultation with the Footsteps licensee and regional leaders, developed the following recommendations. That:</p><p>5.1 the licensee, regional leaders and teachers extend monitoring systems and provisions for minimising the risks to children and ensuring their safety5.2 regional leaders and teachers strengthen aspects of assessment practices5.3 the licensee, regional leaders and teachers improve self-review practices in ways that help them to better evaluate the quality of services and outcomes for children.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-footsteps-education-ltd" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Footsteps Education Ltd</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Footsteps Education Ltd.</p><p>Footsteps Education Limited is a national home-based education and care provider with networks of various sizes throughout the country. The service employs regional leaders and visiting teachers to provide support for children and caregivers.</p><p>Some of the common features of the service include:</p><ul>
<li>the wide variety of care arrangements in place for children</li>
<li>the large numbers of children (up to 50%) that are in the care of social agencies</li>
<li>the significant number of enrolled children in some networks who are M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p>Footsteps Education has links with agencies involved with the families and the children in their care. This includes the Child Youth and Family Service. Many children attend other early childhood education (ECE) services in their local community.</p><p>There is a national leadership structure and an extensive range of documents to support the delivery of their services. Communication and professional development involves the wide use of information and communication technologies.</p><p>This network covers Christchurch, North and South Canterbury and the Central Otago regions. In the Christchurch area children, families, caregivers and teachers have been managing the impact of earthquakes.</p><p>Particular strengths of this network include:</p><ul>
<li>the way teachers support caregivers to build on children&rsquo;s interests to extend their learning and development</li>
<li>the use of effective teaching practices and the range of resources to support children and caregivers, including well-documented assessments</li>
<li>the overall quality of relationships and interactions between teachers, children and caregivers.</li>
</ul><p>The most significant areas for review and development include:</p><ul>
<li>refining aspects of assessment practices</li>
<li>building on initiatives to support parents and caregivers</li>
<li>extending aspects of self review and improving environmental safety.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
