</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>TopKids Dey Street, formerly known as Kids to Five on Dey Street, is located in Hamilton East. The centre is licensed for 70 children including 20 who are up to two years old. At the time of this review there were 82 children on the roll, of whom 27 identified as Māori. The centre caters for increasing numbers of children from multicultural backgrounds. Children play and learn in three age-based play areas. All areas offer free-flow indoor and outdoor play as well as opportunities for children to visit other areas when they wish to do so.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, the centre's staffing has remained stable. Many positive practices identified in the 2014 ERO report have been maintained and enhanced, and there has been a strong focus on addressing identified development areas. Teachers have engaged in internal and external professional development opportunities to improve assessment and bicultural practices. They have also increased their knowledge and understanding of teaching practices that engage boys in learning. Improvements to indoor and outdoor play areas have resulted in welcoming learning environments where children can readily learn through play.</p><p>The centre's philosophy values positive relationships with its community. There is also an emphasis on valuing what children already know and bring to their learning and play. The centre's well-established, family-like culture encourages parents/whānau to participate in the programme and to attend regular centre events and activities.</p><p>The centre is one of over 200 education and care services operated throughout New Zealand under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Limited (BestStart), formerly known as Kidicorp (NZ) Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from high-quality sensitive, respectful and responsive relationships with and between teachers, parents and the community. Teachers value children's choices and readily tune into their play and working theories, developing their oral language skills and sustaining engagement. Many activities within the learning environment are co-constructed between children and adults. Intentional teaching promotes a suitable balance between child and teacher-led learning. Children’s routines and individual preferences are respected. They play and learn in a calm, settled atmosphere. Children are confident and competent learners.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively and effectively to extend individual children’s recognised interests to ensure that learning is meaningful and enjoyable. Kaupapa and te reo Māori, literacy, mathematics, science, music and creative skills are well integrated into the programme. Appropriate 'be school ready' practices are fostered at each age level. Transitions into the centre, between age-based play areas, and to school are sensitively managed according to the needs of individual children and their families. Maori children experience whanaungatanga and success.</p><p>Stimulating and attractively presented learning environments encourage children's thinking, wondering and creativity. Careful consideration of play activities, in consultation with children, results in maximised use of space and resources that continually increase the complexity of learning. Wall displays make learning visible and reinforce literacy and mathematics concepts. Well-chosen, natural, open-ended resources, are readily accessible in all play areas. Spacious well-designed outdoor areas maximise opportunities for physical challenge, construction, social play and exploration of the living world. The environment enhances children's sense of ownership and belonging at the centre.</p><p>High quality education and care for infants and toddlers is warm and nurturing. This reflects the centre’s recognition of the importance of attachment between adults and very young children. A high teacher to child ratio, and full-time, qualified teachers contribute to consistent care and understanding of children’s individual needs, rhythms and routines. Teachers maximise learning opportunities within flexible care routines, and maintain a calm, slow pace in which younger children have space and time to lead their learning. Parents have daily opportunities to communicate and discuss matters relating to their children. Infants and toddlers have many opportunities to become capable communicators and explorers.</p><p>High quality assessment practices reflect teachers' reflective and collaborative focus on this aspect of their professional practice. Children's portfolios deliberately include an innovative range of narratives that demonstrate the increasing complexity of their learning, and also capture individual personalities and memorable moments. Assessments, which increasingly include bicultural perspectives, are regularly analysed to assist teachers in understanding and strengthening children’s learning pathways. Sharing profile entries digitally with parents enhances the seamlessness of the home-centre partnership. Parents and whānau are able to immediately comment on children’s new learning and development. Children have easy access to their profiles so that they can revisit and discuss their learning experiences. These practices enhance their identity as successful learners.</p><p>The centre manager has established a culture in which all children are valued and affirmed, and staff are continually encouraged to develop their leadership capacity. A high level of relational trust is conducive to professional dialogue, negotiation, problem solving and critical reflection. Leaders are committed to a robust appraisal process that includes frequent discussions about progress in relation to personal goals. Teachers' inquiries focus on improving learning progress for groups of Māori and Pacific children along with others who have diverse needs. Leaders demonstrate high levels of professional knowledge and respond positively to constructive feedback. Self-review processes follow BestStart guidelines and result in continuous improvement in outcomes for children.</p><p>BestStart provides strong direction and guidance for centre leaders and staff. The business manager and professional services manager give helpful advice through regular formal and informal reviews of this centre. They effectively communicate and model commitment to developing and sustaining high quality practices. BestStart has a strong emphasis on employing qualified and professionally capable teachers and provides targeted professional development opportunities to improve teaching and leadership skills.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre recognises, and ERO agrees, that next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embed cultural values throughout planning, teaching, assessment and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review how the aspirations of whānau, children's understanding of their learning, and teachers' professional knowledge contribute to programme planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Dey Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Dey Street will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato / Bay of Plenty</p><p>19 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
