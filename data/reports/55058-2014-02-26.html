</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Port Ahuriri Playcentre is located in inner city Napier, close to Napier Port. The centre offers supervised group sessions two mornings per week for a maximum of 23 children, including 13 children up to two years of age.</p><p>The playcentre roll has decreased significantly since the October 2010 ERO report. As a result, a relatively low number of parents are in training. At the time of this review several newly enrolled families were in attendance.</p><p>The playcentre has had a good reporting history with ERO. However, this 2013 evaluation finds there are significant areas for development in order to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 reviews in the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association (the association).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The association should ensure that the playcentre receives support appropriate to its needs.</p><p>Children are warmly welcomed into the playcentre and show a sense of belonging. They are secure and confident to explore the learning environment. An appropriate range of freely available equipment and resources supports their independence.</p><p>The centre philosophy, of adults supporting child-initiated play, is not being well met through the programme and interactions. Adults frequently miss opportunities to build on children‚Äôs interests and help them sustain their play. Expectations of playcentre membership should be made clear to all parents so that children‚Äôs learning is consistently supported.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum requires strengthening. Adults use te reo MƒÅori during routines, such as karakia before morning tea, and occasionally during the session. Resources acknowledge te ao MƒÅori. These aspects and the commitment by all parents involved in the playcentre should be further developed.</p><p>Children‚Äôs strengths, interests and learning are not consistently supported. Links between assessment, planning and evaluation need to be more effectively identified. This was an area for development in the previous ERO report. Adults record interests that are emerging for some individuals and for groups of children. There is some reflection on learning and ways this can be extended. This process requires strengthening, and implementing consistently, to assist adults to respond purposefully to individual children‚Äôs interests and needs.</p><p>Self review is not yet well developed. There is a cycle of policy review led by the association. Spontaneous reviews involve adult discussion and reflection. However, there is limited evidence and information gathered to help make decisions or to review changes made. Playcentre members need support to understand how self review can be used to improve the quality of programmes for children.</p><p>Policies and procedures relating to children‚Äôs safety and wellbeing are not well used. The playcentre should seek support from the association to ensure that policies guiding practice are followed consistently. During the review, ERO identified significant hazards to children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>lack of adequate supervision of children</li>
<li>children‚Äôs access to dangerous resources and hazardously stored equipment</li>
<li>inadequate practices and record keeping relating to children sleeping, accident recording and excursions</li>
<li>inappropriate fire evacuation and earthquake practices.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the association needs to meet its accountability in relation to employment of staff in this playcentre by putting systems in place to ensure all personnel who are required to be, are police vetted and regularly appraised.</p><p>There is a lack of professional leadership to support necessary improvements to the quality of education and care for children. The present level of support from the association is not sufficient to address the issues identified in this report. ERO recommends that the playcentre association undertakes an in-depth analysis of these issues in order to target appropriate support to the members of Port Ahuriri Playcentre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Port Ahuriri Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:.assessment, planning and evaluation</p><ul>
<li>children's physical safety, including supervision, hazards and regular evacuation practices</li>
<li>suitable human resource management practices including a system of regular appraisal and that those who are required to be, are police vetted (association)</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>governance and leadership (includes the association).</li>

ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Port Ahuriri Playcentre will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>26 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
