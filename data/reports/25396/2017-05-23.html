</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rosebank Early Childhood Centre is located on the grounds of Rosebank School. The centre license has been extended, providing a Samoan bilingual context for 38 children, including up to six under two years of age. The children who attend the service are predominantly of Samoan heritage. Children arrive with varying ability to speak Samoan and many progress to the school's Samoan bilingual unit when they reach school age.</p><p>The management committee employs three qualified teachers and two unqualified staff. The teaching team now includes a new supervisor appointed in 2016 and some new staff. The centre manager/licensee is very experienced in Pacific early childhood education. She has had a key role in establishing the service.</p><p>The 2015 ERO review identified a need to improve governance and management processes through strategic planning, internal evaluation and distributed responsibility. Non-compliance was also identified related to personnel and financial management, the quality of teaching and learning, and aspects of record keeping and hazard management.</p><p>The management committee includes parents, a community member and a teacher from the school's Samoan bilingual unit. The committee meets regularly to discuss governance and management matters. They have made progress in most areas for development noted in the 2015 ERO report.</p><p>The manager/licensee agrees that further ongoing external support will be necessary to build a shared understanding of effective practice, and strengthen centre sustainability. This review has identified new areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and provision for children's safety.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and energetic. They experience opportunities for co-operative and mixed age play. Children are curious to explore their surroundings and many play happily at table-top activities with and alongside staff.</p><p>Teachers should ensure that the programme and learning environment support children's choices each day in all areas of play, including physical activity, messy play and outdoor play. Teachers should improve provision for uninterrupted, sustained play and opportunities for children to experience challenging and complex play that encourages their thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Many children demonstrate an understanding of and ability to use Samoan language in formal ways such as through lotu and pese. The learning environment is strongly reflective of Samoan language and culture. The youngest children frequently hear adults modelling Samoan language through their conversations, songs and interactions. These strategies align well to the centre philosophy and help support children's sense of identity. A next step for teachers could be to evaluate how well children's Samoan language is developing in their conversations as they play.</p><p>Children in the youngest age group receive nurturing care. The premises have been extended to provide a combined play and sleep area for the children up to two years of age. The supervisor agrees that it would be beneficial for teachers to have external professional development specifically for the infant and toddler age group. This should assist staff to strengthen their support for children's individual learning and development.</p><p>Professional development in curriculum and internal evaluation is not yet having a sufficient impact on teachers' practice to improve outcomes for children. Teachers are learning to be more responsive to children's individual interests and dispositions through an emergent curriculum. Leaders have improved systems for curriculum documentation. Curriculum records show some examples of teachers' practice where evaluation is beginning to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The manager has worked alongside external professional support to respond to the 2015 ERO report. The developments she has led include:</p><ul>
<li>documenting and aligning internal evaluation guidelines to a Samoan <em>tofa manino</em> framework and philosophy, <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and ERO's resource, <em>He Pou Tātaki</em></li>
<li>internal professional development in self review</li>
<li>implementing new systems and processes for personnel management and appraisal, and modelling critical reflection for staff</li>
<li>implementing systems for, and reporting to the management committee in relation to, financial management, strategic and annual plans and policy review</li>
<li>extending the centre license numbers</li>
<li>networking with and accessing external professional expertise.</li>
</ul><p>The manager/licensee should continue to implement a cycle of ongoing improvement and policy review.</p><p>The centre manager/licensee has participated in professional development to gain understanding of the new requirements of the Education Council. As a result of this work some good progress is evident in the area of teacher appraisal.</p><p>The next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>undertake professional development to strengthen the evaluative requirements of the appraisal process</li>
<li>document professional development and improve evidence of how they are meeting the Practicing Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the priorities to improve outcomes for children and centre sustainability include ongoing external professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>implement a full policy framework that reflects current licensing and legal requirements</li>
<li>embed an emergent curriculum and teaching and learning practices that are consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em> and current research</li>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation and reflective practice</li>
<li>collaboratively review the centre philosophy and reflect on what it means for teachers' practice and the centre environment</li>
<li>develop teacher leadership and a team culture of shared understanding and responsibility.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rosebank Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><p>ERO found areas of non-compliance in the service related to curriculum and health and safety:</p><ul>
<li>provide a curriculum that is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em></li>
<li>document and implement three monthly evacuation drills</li>
<li>update centre policies to reflect the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em> and for excursions and travel in motor vehicles</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1,HS 8,18,31.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rosebank Early Childhood Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Steffan Brough<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>23 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
