</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikato Montessori Early Education Centre is a privately owned service situated at Tamahere east of Hamilton. The centre is licensed for 60 children over two years of age. At the time of this ERO review there were 47 children enrolled at the centre of whom six identify as MƒÅori. Twenty three children are from Asian families.</p><p>Children learn in two mixed-age classrooms. A covered verandah with gardens is available for all-weather activities. Further outdoor areas are provided for physical activity at designated times throughout the day. Since the centre opened in 2006, governance and management personnel have remained the same.</p><p>The centre continues to strongly promote the Montessori philosophy and curriculum, which fosters children's self-management, curiosity and understanding of their community and wider world. Teachers at this centre are qualified and trained in both the Montessori and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from respectful, responsive interactions and relationships with teachers. Teachers know children and families well and use positive guidance strategies to foster children's self-management and independence. Written and oral language skills along with mathematics concepts are developed in a variety of equipment-based ways. Tuakana teina relationships are deliberately encouraged. Older children play well with younger children and support their learning. Children engage in a wide range of sustained, self-selected learning experiences.</p><p>Routines are well established. These provide structure for the programme and support children in developing a sense of wellbeing and belonging. Parents and families support their children in developing individual pepeha that recognise family and cultural backgrounds. Children are taught waiata and have access to bicultural resources. Transition into the centre and to the adjacent school is smoothly facilitated, according to the needs of children and their families.</p><p>Attractive, spacious indoor environments reflect the kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy. A wide variety of readily accessed resources are appropriate for the range of age groups. The shared verandah area provides space for painting, gardening, carpentry and other practical activities. Children are able to make choices about their use of indoor and outdoor equipment. A calm, settled tone is evident throughout the centre.</p><p>Planning is informed by children‚Äôs strengths, capabilities and preferences for learning. Presentations of learning in children's portfolios show that children engage with increasingly sophisticated equipment, including natural resources, as they develop new knowledge and skills. Children‚Äôs success is regularly monitored by all teachers. Records of learning are shared with parents through formal six-monthly interviews. Children have opportunities to revisit and discuss their learning through continual access to a range of materials and resources.</p><p>The head of school maintains a strong focus on implementing the Montessori philosophy and its links with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Leaders and teachers create a warm welcoming culture where parents/whƒÅnau feel valued. Teachers have engaged in professional development including presentations about the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Planned and spontaneous reviews have focussed on strengthening policies, teacher induction, portfolio documentation, and the outdoor area. The annual plan is well aligned to strategic goals and regularly reviewed. Leaders have established a good system for staff appraisal, which is focused on teachers' reflections about their practice and meeting regulatory requirements. Teachers appreciate the professional staff culture underpinned by clear expectations for curriculum, planning and delivery, centre operations and positive outcomes for learners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In accordance with the recently revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> statement, managers and teachers should now review and revise:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment planning and evaluation to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>how children‚Äôs dispositions and social development are extended over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural and multicultural references that show how children's culture, language and identity are valued</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review processes so that they include contributions from parents and children to enhance the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikato Montessori Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waikato Montessori Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>1 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
