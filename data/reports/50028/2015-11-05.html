</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Rawhiti Kindergarten is part of the Te Ra Waldorf School community in Raumati South. The centre offers early childhood education within a Waldorf Steiner context.</p><p>The kindergarten caters for up to 50 children of mixed ages in three separate classrooms. Children share an outdoor space. Three experienced teachers with both Waldorf and national training work alongside teaching assistants.</p><p>Most of the children who attend this kindergarten go on to schooling at the Raumati School site under the same governance and management structure. The school and its kindergartens in Raumati and Paekakariki are members of the New Zealand Federation of Rudolf Steiner Waldorf Schools.</p><p>Key aspects of the clearly evident and enacted philosophy include, children learning best through direct experience, and in self-initiated and self-directed play. Other elements include strong rhythm, repetition, and engaging the child‚Äôs natural inclination for imitation, allowing their potential to unfold.</p><p>There have been some recent gains in addressing the areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO report. These have included teachers growing their understanding of te ao MƒÅori and strengthening of the bicultural perspective in the curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs interactions are positive, respectful, and unhurried. Teachers implement a range of practices that foster children‚Äôs learning. Self reliance is promoted. Children are responsive to their peers and collaborate well with each other. Sustained play and high levels of engagement are evident. Transition is purposefully managed.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau share information in a variety of ways that assist teachers to know about children. Teachers gather a range of data that show children‚Äôs progress over time. This is discussed as a staff and wider faculty to support children‚Äôs holistic development.</p><p>Children‚Äôs oral language is well supported and purposefully promoted. Teachers promote high levels of child-initiated play. Continuity of education and care enables teachers to know children and their families well. The physical environment stimulates creativity, imagination, curiosity, and discovery. Eurhythmy, as part of the curriculum, provides a way of fostering children‚Äôs language learning.</p><p>Self review is occurring at teacher, kindergarten and organisational level. A culture of reflection is evident. The recently developed evaluation form is in the early stages of being used by teachers to support them to know about the effectiveness of the programme in promoting positive outcomes.</p><p>ERO and staff agree that some aspects of self review need to be grown. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further development of the process</li>
<li>deeper analysis of information gathered</li>
<li>showing how review improves outcomes for children and teaching practices.</li>
</ul><p>The 2015 - 2017 strategic plan aligns to the school‚Äôs core values. It outlines direction, and identifies the priorities and annual actions the school believes will enhance student learning. Further developing the annual plan goals to more clearly focus on the quality of provision and outcomes for children is a next step. This includes regular monitoring of the actions to show progress.</p><p>ERO affirms the intent to inquire into and review the role of kindergarten coordinator. This should assist in shared understanding of roles and responsibilities and foster an emphasis on leadership for teaching and learning. Formalising information sharing between the school board and kindergarten should help trustees know more clearly about the quality of education and care.</p><p>Teachers have access to professional development opportunities that align to teacher and schoolwide goals. The appraisal process continues to need further development. This should include stronger, more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and focus on outcomes for children. More regular and targeted feedback about teaching practice, and wider use of targeted observation should further support teacher development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and staff agree that the following areas should be further developed:</p><ul>
<li>self-review processes</li>
<li>annual planning goals and formal reporting to the trust board</li>
<li>review and inquiry into the role of the kindergarten coordinator</li>
<li>the appraisal process for teachers and assistants.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Rawhiti Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, in particular ensuring that all staff are part of a regular appraisal process.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Rawhiti Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>5 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
