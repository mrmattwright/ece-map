</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Campus Corner Early Learning Centre provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is affiliated to the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology (NMIT) in central Nelson. There is a requirement that at least 50% of the roll are children of NMIT students and staff. The centre also welcomes children and their families from the wider community.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board that includes parent and staff representatives. A head teacher manages the centre on a daily basis. The majority of staff are fully trained and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre is organised in two areas. One space is for infants and toddlers up to the age of two and the other for young children. Each area has its own outdoor play space. There is a senior teacher in each area responsible for ensuring the daily programme is well implemented.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teachers have successfully developed a shared philosophy about the ways of working with children to effectively support their learning and development. This philosophy is highly evident in practices throughout the centre.</p><p>Positive relationships and respectful interactions are evident across the centre, including between adults and children, and among children.</p><p>Infants, toddlers and young children benefit from the emphasis teachers place on:</p><ul>
<li>supporting their emotional and physical wellbeing and sense of belonging</li>
<li>providing a child-centred curriculum with a strong focus on opportunities for children to be independent and make choices in their play</li>
<li>ensuring routines are calm, unhurried and well used as learning opportunities</li>
<li>making sure there are times when children can experience sufficient periods of uninterrupted play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers' records show they know individual children well. They notice significant learning for children and recognise possible learning opportunities.</p><p>Teachers interact with infants, toddlers and young children in ways that effectively promote their learning. They:</p><ul>
<li>listen carefully and respond promptly to children’s cues and preferences</li>
<li>make considered decisions about their involvement in children's play, encouraging children to problem solve for themselves</li>
<li>give children opportunities to demonstrate and build on their competence</li>
<li>help children develop the skills to play and interact successfully with others.</li>
</ul><p>Children's curiosity and exploration is supported by the purposeful way teachers present the environment. They regularly involve children in caring for the environment. A strong emphasis is placed on children being able to use natural materials, everyday things and resources that can be used in many ways within their play. Children’s learning experiences are also extended through regular excursions into the local community, such as visits to local schools, and visitors to the centre.</p><p>Teachers are making increasing use of resources to support their understandings of Māori values and concepts and help them to teach in culturally responsive ways. They have identified that this is an area they want to continue to strengthen.</p><p>There are a range of practices that effectively involve parents in the everyday life of the centre. This includes parent representation at board level, use of parent skills and strengths in the daily programme to extend the learning experiences for children. There are many opportunities for parents to contribute their views through regular questionnaires.</p><p>Useful centre priorities have been developed in a collaborative way amongst the teachers and the board. The teachers are currently focused on recognising multicultural perspectives in the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and focused on improvement. They make good use of individual and self review to improve practices and outcomes for children. Self review is well aligned to appraisal goals. </p><p>Staff have a collaborative approach to teaching and learning. Centre leaders make good use of teacher strengths to support improvement. This provides ongoing opportunities to build on teachers' leadership capabilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing systems to monitor and evaluate strategic planning</li>
<li>strengthening the process of whole centre planned self review</li>
<li>reviewing the effectiveness of planning and assessment documentation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The centre has not yet aligned its policies and procedures to the Vulnerable Children’s Act. It is aware of its obligations and is in the early stages of doing this.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Campus Corner Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>12 April 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
