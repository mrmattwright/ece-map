</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Russell Street Nursery provides specialised care and learning for as many as 25 children up to two years of age. Parents bring children to this central-city service from the wider Dunedin area. Next door is a second centre run by the same association for children over two years of age. About a quarter of the children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>There have been some staff changes since the last ERO review. At the time of the review there were five fully-trained teachers and two in training. The ratio of teacher to child is often as low as 1 to 3 to ensure there are plenty of opportunities for one-to-one interactions to benefit individual children. Centre leaders work well with teachers to maintain a shared philosophy and set of beliefs about providing care and learning for very young children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy can be seen in action. Teachers are caring and nurturing. They focus on free movement for children and provide opportunities for children to explore at their own pace. Care is taken to provide for and support children appropriately for their ages and stages. Children play in a calm, settled, unhurried environment.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing the areas for review and development identified in the 2011 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five centres managed by the Dunedin Community Childcare Association (DCCA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme for children is very responsive to children‚Äôs interests, preferences and strengths. Teachers organise the environment so that children have easy access to both indoor and outdoor spaces. These areas are well resourced and encourage exploration. Each child is supported by a ‚Äòkey teacher‚Äô, with a second teacher to step in when required. The ‚Äòkey teacher‚Äô places a high priority on each child in her care, knowing the child and the family well, and caring for and supporting the child‚Äôs learning closely.</p><p>Children‚Äôs wishes and preferences can be seen in the ways teachers show they are responsive to each child‚Äôs interests and needs. Teachers have respectful, collaborative relationships with each other, and with parents and whƒÅnau. They have purposeful, respectful interactions with children.¬†</p><p>Children play alongside and interact with each other positively. Older children nurture and interact well with younger children in their play.¬†</p><p>Teachers know the children very well and are responsive to their verbal and non-verbal cues. They:</p><ul>
<li>have positive, caring and affirming relationships with children</li>
<li>work effectively together to support children when they need extra care</li>
<li>ensure routines are responsive and sensitive to the child‚Äôs needs</li>
<li>make good use of opportunities to develop children‚Äôs vocabulary, knowledge, skills, and awareness of the world.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers record how children‚Äôs language is supported and is developing. They take care to reflect the bicultural heritage of New Zealand and ensure there are opportunities for children to hear and use te reo MƒÅori. There is awareness of tikanga MƒÅori within the centre. Teachers invite input from MƒÅori whƒÅnau and they are reviewing the effectiveness of this way of gathering and responding to the wishes of parents of MƒÅori children.¬†</p><p>Teachers‚Äô transition practices are well considered to support children effectively within the centre and as they move to the next centre. Teachers spoke knowledgeably to ERO about the learning opportunities provided to support children‚Äôs early mathematics learning and gave specific examples of how these are included in everyday activities.</p><p>The profile books that record children‚Äôs learning show that children receive a wide range of experiences within the centre and beyond. The recent introduction of an on-line portfolio system is giving families greater opportunity to be involved in their children‚Äôs learning. Special family events are included in learning programmes to help families feel well involved in the life of the centre.¬†</p><p>Centre leaders model and promote a shared understanding of the centre‚Äôs philosophy with a focus on children, their unique identity and potential. Leaders have a collaborative, high-trust way of working with the teaching team. They purposefully:</p><ul>
<li>build the capacity of leadership with the teaching team</li>
<li>encourage the ongoing development of all staff</li>
<li>support new teachers in training</li>
<li>strategically choose new staff who will fit into the team culture of care.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers need to improve the way their records of learning for all children regularly show over time how children are progressing in relation to their identified goals. Teachers should clearly record:</p><ul>
<li>how they have given ongoing support in the development of the identified goal</li>
<li>the impact of specific teaching strategies on children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team would benefit from better documentation of the centre‚Äôs expectations for each aspect of teaching. This would confirm that they have shared and agreed understandings. It would also provide a sound basis for effective review of how well they are implementing these expectations.</p><p>A further next step is to strengthen self review to ensure review is against the documented, agreed expectations, with useful indicators of good practice. This would ensure self-review practices confirm what is going well and identify any areas needing improvement. The teaching team should then plan how to bring about improvements and embed them in the revised expectations of good practice.</p><p>Teachers have identified that they want to use the new portfolio system to gather greater input from parents about children‚Äôs learning and teachers‚Äô curriculum decisions.</p><h3>Governance and Management</h3><p>The DCCA is governed by an executive committee and managed by a newly appointed director. The experienced and supportive executive:</p><ul>
<li>has a strong commitment to teaching and learning</li>
<li>has developed policies to guide practices within the centres</li>
<li>seek the views of parents and staff</li>
<li>is more purposefully appraising their teaching staff, in particular against the registered teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>Head teachers appreciate the regular meeting they have as a group with the director.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the association has developed a useful framework for self review. The association management need to ensure its practices and those of the centres are following the guidelines. Better implementation of the guidelines should lead to more effective identification of what is going well and what needs further development. Findings from self review should be an integral part of planning.</p><p>The executive committee has developed four aspirational strategic goals. The associated annual plan could be improved by setting out how each goal is to be specifically achieved. The association recognises the need for each centre to develop annual plans that align with the association‚Äôs priorities. More detailed plans would provide a useful basis for head teachers and the director to write their reports against and for the executive committee to monitor progress against.¬†</p><p>The board needs to clarify the roles of the association management and leadership, including the director's responsibilities. This should help the achievement of the strategic plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Russell Street Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the early childhood leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>develop written procedures to guide the results of police vetting and the management of related risks</li>
<li>improve its practices for the assessment and management of risk for all excursions.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Russell Street Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>9 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
