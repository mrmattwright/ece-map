</table><p>Hoon Hay Community Preschool is 'very well placed' to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hoon Hay Community Preschool is a community-based service that provides all day care for children aged from birth to five years of age. It operates in a Christchurch City Council-owned building and is managed by a teacher and parent committee.</p><p>Children up to two years of age have a separate indoor area which is organised in a way that allows them to easily interact with all the teachers and older children.</p><p>The Ministry of Education has provided additional funding to ensure that low teacher-child ratios can be maintained. The long-serving teachers are all fully qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is based on providing quality care while meeting and respecting the needs of the community. The philosophy and centre vision are clearly evident throughout all aspects of the centre operations.</p><p>The teaching staff have addressed the recommendations outlined in the 2012 ERO report. This includes strengthening aspects of assessment and the ways teachers reflect on the impact of their teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>All children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. They experience respectful, caring and nurturing relationships with teachers. Cooperative relationships are strongly evident and encouraged between children and adults.</p><p>Children have choice in the programme. They are supported to express their ideas and have involvement in some decision making. Children are provided with an interesting range of learning activities and have easy access to a wide variety of resources.</p><p>Teachers engage in one-to-one responsive interactions with children, especially with infants and toddlers. They are actively involved in children‚Äôs self-initiated play activities. Routines are flexible and adapted to meet children‚Äôs individual needs. Teachers work closely together to share information that supports children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Children are well supported as they transition into, within and beyond the centre. Teachers work closely with families and external support agencies to meet the specific needs of individual children, as needed. They have built strong relationships with local schools to help children‚Äôs transitions.</p><p>Teachers value and use parents‚Äô knowledge and skills. They are continuing to build respectful and responsive relationships with MƒÅori whƒÅnau. Some parents of MƒÅori children offer teachers valuable support and guidance in the use of te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>The teaching team is highly collaborative and improvement focused. Teachers are given time to critically reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices. They set appropriate goals for improvement. These are regularly monitored and used to support teachers‚Äô learning and future direction.</p><p>The supervisor makes good use of individual teacher strengths and is building a culture of shared leadership. The teaching team has effective systems in place to monitor children‚Äôs wellbeing and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The supervisor and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to:</p><ul>
<li>review the appraisal system</li>
<li>update the current strategic plan.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers and leaders have also identified that they should further develop the good practices in place to support MƒÅori children to experience success as MƒÅori. They need to ensure that the value and respect they have for different cultures is more visible within the environment.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hoon Hay Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hoon Hay Community Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>26 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
