</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edubase In-Home Care has its head office in Tauranga and provides governance and management oversight for two home-based care networks in the Bay of Plenty. 46902 is a standard-funded network of nine untrained educators, licensed for 80 children, including up to 40 under two years old. At the time of this review 34 children, including 12 MƒÅori, were enrolled. Educators provide in-home care for up to four children at any one time in Tauranga, Rotorua, Whakatane, Opotiki and surrounding districts. The service operates alongside a sister, quality-funded network.</p><p>The service provider is the manager who has professional leadership responsibilities. A director oversees financial and business matters supported by administrative staff. Qualified early childhood teachers, known as coordinators, visit educators in their homes. They offer educational support and mentoring and undertake health and safety checks. Children attend playgroups with educators, take planned excursions into the wider community and participate in social and special events together.</p><p>The service philosophy aims to provide quality home environments, small group sizes and a responsive curriculum underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em></p><p>Edubase In-Home Care was first licensed in 2015. In November 2016 it merged with another home-based care service. The Ministry of Education issued a full licence in June 2017. This is the first ERO review for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a programme that is responsive to their diverse individual cultures, strengths and interests. They participate in meaningful, real-life experiences in homes alongside educators and their peers. Educators make good use of local parks, places of interest, and visiting with other educators. This is assisting children to develop an understanding of their local and wider communities. Children benefit from participating in a wide variety of programmes such as gymnastics, music groups and library programmes. Transitions into educator homes and on to local schools are well managed. Children are developing early concepts of literacy, numeracy and natural science which are meaningfully integrated into their play.</p><p>MƒÅori children are affirmed in their culture. They benefit from educators with connections to local iwi who value and integrate their knowledge of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into care and learning. Educators are able to access a bilingual playgroup that integrates kapa haka for children. Coordinators are building their knowledge about culturally responsive practices that assist MƒÅori children to be confident in their culture. Educators and coordinators continue to seek ways to promote the success and potential of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Educators and coordinators document children's learning in individual portfolios. These documents are shared with families and whƒÅnau through digital portfolios. Parents are able to contribute their views using this initiative. Children‚Äôs social skills are encouraged through opportunities for small and larger group experiences with trusted adults and their peers. Children demonstrate a strong sense of well-being and belonging.</p><p>Infants and toddlers observed by ERO were calm and secure as they participated in a mixed-age, playgroup setting. Children and adults were respectful of infants. Children up to two years of age have ready access to materials and resources appropriate to their ages and stages of development. Parent aspirations for the care of their infants and toddlers are shared and respected and familiar routines are maintained. Coordinators and educators promote responsive and respectful care practices for infants that are underpinned by current theory and research. Educators are provided with useful guidelines and professional learning opportunities aligned to these practices. Infants and toddlers experience caring and nurturing relationships with educators in safe and secure family-like settings.</p><p>Trained coordinators are well qualified and experienced. They make frequent visits and provide supportive advice and guidance for untrained educators. Coordinators have quickly established a collegial and professional partnership and take shared responsibility for overseeing support for the educators. ERO observed the following positive practices at the playgroup:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>good modelling of strategies that support educators to positively manage children‚Äôs behaviour and promote their social skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of rich oral language when interacting with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrating concepts of mathematics, science and literacy into play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flexible routines that allowed children to make choices and persist in their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children encouraged to build their self-management skills and knowledge of healthy habits.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Coordinators work in partnership with specialist agencies when responding to the identified needs of children. Effective teaching is promoting children‚Äôs social skills and confidence as competent learners.</p><p>The director and manager set clear and high expectations for the management and organisation of the service. There are appropriate policies and procedures, useful frameworks and documentation to guide service practices for education and care. Documentation seen by ERO indicates that appropriate health and safety procedures are followed in homes. Positive and professional relationships are evident amongst whƒÅnau/families, educators, coordinators and leaders.</p><p>Leadership provides generous opportunities and incentives for professional learning and sharing across the two networks. The service benefits from the combined knowledge and experience of leaders and coordinators in the provision of home-based care. The service is highly responsive to whƒÅnau aspirations when placing children with educators. The manager has a good understanding of self review and is implementing systems and processes for the development and improvement of the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders should continue to review and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning and self review to more closely align with the Ministry of Education regulatory framework and indicators of best practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expectations for the quality and consistency of assessment and planning provided by coordinators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the performance management system to align with current Education Council expectations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edubase In-Home Care completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Service leaders must ensure that the appraisal process for coordinators meets the requirements of the Education Council Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p><i><em>[Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, GMA6.]</em></i></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edubase In-Home Care will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand.

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
