<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Paihia Waitangi Kindergarten in Northland provides very good quality education for children between three and five years of age. The kindergarten operates within the framework of the Northland Kindergarten Association. Association personnel provide professional and operational support for teachers.</p><p>Children appear to enjoy their time at the kindergarten. They play happily together and follow their own interests and lead their own learning. The organisation of learning resources and flexible centre routines encourage children to be resourceful, creative and curious. Children&rsquo;s learning and achievements are acknowledged and celebrated in colourful wall displays and in individual records of learning. The recent building extension has helped to transform the learning environment.</p><p>Teaching programmes focus on encouraging children to be competent and confident learners. This approach enables children to develop skills such as concentration, perseverance, resourcefulness and creativity. Children&rsquo;s knowledge of literacy, science and increasingly in te reo M&#257;ori is prioritised. Teachers help children develop social skills such as making friends, contributing and being responsible.</p><p>Parents and wh&#257;nau find the kindergarten staff inclusive and supportive. Parents report that they are well informed about the kindergarten and their child&rsquo;s learning. Parents and wh&#257;nau, children and teachers have a strong and sense of belonging and whanaungatanga.</p><p>The kindergarten is well managed. There is a culture of professionalism, cooperation and collaboration among the teaching team. Teachers&rsquo; strong commitment to children&rsquo;s learning and well-being is reflected in their willingness to review and improve teaching programmes and practices. Managers and teachers are well placed to address areas for development identified in this ERO report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Paihia-Waitangi Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPaihia-Waitangi Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Several changes have occurred since ERO&rsquo;s previous visit in November 2008. Staffing has increased to three full-time teachers and the morning session time has been altered to start at 8.45am to better suit parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Teachers continually seek to enhance the learning opportunities provided for children. It is a requirement that children are enrolled for a minimum of three days a week so they have equitable opportunities to develop social competency and a sense of belonging. Teachers have responded positively to ideas gained through professional development, Kindergarten Association personnel, tertiary students on practicum and the previous ERO review report.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Programme planning and assessment.</em> Teachers plan high quality programmes based on Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum, and the interests and cultures of children and their families/wh&#257;nau. Teachers&rsquo; respond well to children&rsquo;s daily emerging interests and this helps children to feel valued and become confident learners. Children have many opportunities to develop their social and learning skills.</p><p>One of the outstanding features of the centre is the way that teachers and support staff make programme planning and assessment highly visible and accessible for the children, parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Attractive assessment portfolios and pictorial wall displays of teaching programmes inform parents and wh&#257;nau about children&rsquo;s learning and achievements. These records affirm children&rsquo;s learning dispositions, knowledge and skills, M&#257;ori language and culture, and their developing social skills.</p><p><em>Learning environment.</em> The recent extension to the building has transformed the indoor learning environment. Its spaciousness and the organisation of learning areas facilitate children&rsquo;s access to resources and make it possible to readily accommodate visiting parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor areas and flexible centre routines encourage children to be resourceful, creative and self-reliant learners. Children have good opportunities to develop their interests and ideas independently and to play alongside, and with others with few interruptions.</p><p><em>Interactions and relationships.</em> Warm, trusting, respectful relationships are characteristic of the centre and children happily learn and play together. They make friends and show concern for others. They enjoy having conversations with other children and their teachers. In this climate children develop the confidence to explore, experiment, set challenges for themselves and be creative, competent learners.</p><p><em>Teachers are affirming and supportive.</em> They work alongside the children, quietly and effectively validating children&rsquo;s ideas and learning. They listen carefully to children&rsquo;s ideas, posing questions and giving children time to think about their answers. Children are helped to extend their thinking, overcome problems and resolve conflicts. Teachers have respect and compassion for children with diverse needs. They have high expectations and a shared belief in each child as a confident and competent learner.</p><p><em>Trusting relationships between teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau and the wider community are also a highlight of the kindergarten.</em> These relationships help teachers to know children well and respond to them with warmth and care. Parents and wh&#257;nau make valued contributions to the learning programmes, especially the te reo M&#257;ori programme.</p><p><em>Self review.</em> Kindergarten staff have a good understanding of the value of self review for on-going improvement. Self review occurs in many ways, through strategic and annual plans, teacher performance appraisal and development, programme reviews, and through feedback from Association personnel, parents, wh&#257;nau and children.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and promote and model innovation and best practice, based on current educational theory and research.</p><h4>Areas of development and review</h4><p>Well developed self-review practices are likely to help teachers to address areas for review and development discussed with ERO during this review. Managers, teachers and ERO have agreed on the following priorities for development. They include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enhancing resourcing of learning areas, including multicultural resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further promoting teaching practices that encourage deeper learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing more opportunities for children to continue and revisit their learning, throughout the day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of centre developments on children&rsquo;s learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving health and safety checks.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Paihia-Waitangi Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practices, management and teachers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appropriate parent approval is gained for excursions outside of the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the child protection policy includes a statement ensuring confidentiality for those reporting alleged abuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>police vetting requirements for unqualified staff are maintained.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that teachers should continue to enhance teaching practices and learning resources and extend children&rsquo;s opportunities to revisit their learning throughout the day.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>20 June 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-paihia-waitangi-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Paihia-Waitangi Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Paihia-Waitangi Kindergarten.</p><p>Paihia Waitangi Kindergarten in Northland provides very good quality education for children between three and five years of age. The kindergarten operates within the framework of the Northland Kindergarten Association. Association personnel provide professional and operational support for teachers.</p><p>Children appear to enjoy their time at the kindergarten. They play happily together and follow their own interests and lead their own learning. The organisation of learning resources and flexible centre routines encourage children to be resourceful, creative and curious. Children&rsquo;s learning and achievements are acknowledged and celebrated in colourful wall displays and in individual records of learning. The recent building extension has helped to transform the learning environment.</p><p>Teaching programmes focus on encouraging children to be competent and confident learners. This approach enables children to develop skills such as concentration, perseverance, resourcefulness and creativity. Children&rsquo;s knowledge of literacy, science and increasingly in te reo M&#257;ori is prioritised. Teachers help children develop social skills such as making friends, contributing and being responsible.</p><p>Parents and wh&#257;nau find the kindergarten staff inclusive and supportive. Parents report that they are well informed about the kindergarten and their child&rsquo;s learning. Parents and wh&#257;nau, children and teachers have a strong and sense of belonging and whanaungatanga.</p><p>The kindergarten is well managed. There is a culture of professionalism, cooperation and collaboration among the teaching team. Teachers&rsquo; strong commitment to children&rsquo;s learning and well-being is reflected in their willingness to review and improve teaching programmes and practices. Managers and teachers are well placed to address areas for development identified in this ERO report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
