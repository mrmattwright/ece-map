</table><p>Kids' Kampus (2000) Ltd¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids' Kampus (2000) Ltd is licensed for 65 children, including 25 under two years of age. It provides for an increasingly culturally diverse community.</p><p>The centre's philosophy based on <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki,</span></em> the early childhood curriculum, acknowledges <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> and is inspired by the teachings of Maria Montessori. Centre operations are underpinned by Christian values.</p><p>Children are catered for in two adjacent houses, each with a team leader and designated teaching team. Both houses have an outdoor play area. Children transition from the Koru House to Kauri house between about two and two-and-a-half years of age. Within the houses the children are grouped for some activities such as mat times.</p><p>The centre owner governs the centre, and the centre manager and team leaders provide professional leadership. The staff includes eight qualified and five unqualified teachers. Since the 2016 ERO review, there have been significant changes in staffing and the centre manager has been appointed.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified curriculum strengths, including teachers' interactions and transitions for children through the centre and on to school. Next steps included developing aspects of administration and relationships within the centre community. The owner has since taken a greater role in running the centre and has worked to address these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a wide range of learning activities in a calm, settled environment. Their wellbeing is promoted by positive relationships with adults and each other. Teachers support children's play and affirm them as competent and capable learners.</p><p>The learning environments are spacious and well resourced. There is appropriate physical challenge for children of all ages. For much of the day the children can make decisions about where they play.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are well cared for and have very good opportunities to learn. Individual notebooks for children under one year of age ensure that parents know about their child's day at the centre. Teachers follow these young children's home routines when possible. Their interactions promote children's language development. Teachers support children to make choices about their play by giving them easy access to a wide range of resources.</p><p>Teachers keep parents well informed and invite them to have input into their children's learning. Teachers keep additional records of the older children's learning with Montessori equipment.</p><p>There are opportunities for all children to experience aspects of <span lang="mi">tikanga and</span> <span lang="mi">te reo</span> MƒÅori. Managers could plan more strategically to extend teachers' knowledge in this area. The diverse cultures of children are supported through activities and special events. Teachers speak the home languages of some of the families, which helps with transitions into the centre.</p><p>Teachers are reviewing how they assess and plan for children's learning. The current portfolios include stories about groups and individuals, and they contain examples that demonstrate effective teaching practice. Centre managers could share these good examples to help all teachers to improve planning and assessment practices. Planning in individual stories could focus more on how teachers will promote more complex, child-led play.</p><p>The owner and manager have made significant improvements to aspects of governance and to management practices. The appraisal system has been strengthened, and relevant professional development is provided for staff. Internal evaluation is used to identify areas for further development. A strategic planning process has been established to guide centre development. Centre polices have all been reviewed and a policy review cycle is in place. The day-to-day operation of the centre is guided by the centre's annual plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A key next step is for teachers to continue to strengthen processes for documenting planning and assessment.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids' Kampus (2000) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>take additional steps to ensure that all glass accessible to children is covered by an adhesive film designed to hold the glass in place in the event of it being broken</li>
<li>review the medication policy and consent form to more clearly document the centre‚Äôs practices for gaining verbal parental approval for the administration of Category 2 medications where a child becomes seriously unwell at the service.</li>
</ul><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>2 April 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
