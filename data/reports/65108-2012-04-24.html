<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Takaka Playcentre is one of 14 parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Nelson Playcentres Association (the association). Strategic and policy direction for centre operations is provided by association personnel. They also work in collaboration with centre members to develop and maintain the quality of the early childhood facilities, taking responsibility for education, property and equipment and providing training. A liaison officer appointed by the association provides professional advice, guidance and support for the centre. The association office administrator undertakes the role of licensee.</p><p align="left">The daily programme is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and soundly underpinned by the playcentre philosophy. Children choose freely from a wide range of easily accessible resources. They lead the direction of the programme and are highly engaged for sustained periods in their chosen activities. Creativity, exploration and imaginative play are effectively fostered. There is good provision for early literacy learning with storytelling being a particular strength. Cultural diversity is embraced and home languages are included in conversations.</p><p align="left">Children are settled, focused and confident in the playcentre environment and with the many adults present. Older children clearly articulate their ideas and thinking. They are skilled at cooperating and negotiating and demonstrate strong leadership traits. Children develop as competent learners and communicators.</p><p align="left">Adults are warm, friendly and welcoming. They interact positively with children, celebrating and affirming their successes and achievements. Relationships between the dedicated committee, supervision team and association officers are constructive. Centre members work together effectively and contribute positively to their children&rsquo;s early education. The playcentre also offers the Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education (SPACE) programme for first-time parents.</p><p align="left">Children learn and play in an attractive learning environment. It is richly resourced, catering for all ages, and set up to be inviting and stimulating. Many natural features in the outdoors create a variety of interesting spaces. A focus on recycling and sustainable living is evident through composting and children&rsquo;s gardens. Self review has been used to good effect to enhance the environment and as a result children are settled and engaged productively.</p><p align="left">Centre members agree that areas for continued development include; aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, further integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and better understanding of evidence-based self review as a tool for improvement.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Takaka Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTakaka Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Takaka Playcentre operates under the guidance of the association. Association personnel provide guidance and support to centre members for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning practices. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>the objectives outlined in the strategic plan which set the expectations for quality learning experiences, clear communication with members and streamlining of operation and administration systems</li>
<li>a set of robust policies that guide centre practice that are regularly reviewed and updated</li>
<li>an extensive range of workshops and professional development offered in response to team goals as well as training modules</li>
<li>liaison officers who play a key role in the association by providing advice and guidance to centres</li>
<li>support for children with moderate to severe special needs through the provision of a special needs resource person and access to funding to support identified children in centres</li>
</ul><p align="left">Te Roopu Wh&#257;nau o Whakatu, a group of association families, to support individual centres with a range of initiatives to further the learning and development of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau at playcentre.</p><p align="left">Centre members, with the support of the association, have worked to address the areas for improvement identified in the 2007 ERO report.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Programme</h4><p align="left">Children play and learn in a programme soundly underpinned by the playcentre philosophy. They choose freely from a wide range of easily accessible resources. Children lead the direction of the programme and are highly engaged for sustained periods in their chosen activities. Their creativity, exploration and imaginative play are effectively fostered and feature strongly during the sessions. There is good provision for early literacy learning and practice. Storytelling is a particular strength across the programme.</p><p align="left">The programme is highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Parents and team members share their perspectives on what they notice about children&rsquo;s play. Clear processes are established to help members plan activities and excursions to support or extend exploration. This results in good continuity for children&rsquo;s learning and interests across sessions.</p><h4 align="left">Assessment</h4><p align="left">Attractively presented individual portfolios include pertinent entries and photographs, to show children&rsquo;s participation and learning at playcentre. Links between entries document developing skills and relationships. Children&rsquo;s home cultures and languages are acknowledged and celebrated. Contributions from many adults add depth to these valued records and depict the child from different perspectives, building a clear picture over time.</p><h4 align="left">Environment</h4><p align="left">Recent reorganisation of the learning environment has resulted in an attractive work and play space for children and adults. It is richly resourced, catering for all ages, and set up to be inviting and stimulating. Many natural features in the outdoors create a variety of interesting spaces. Self review has been used to good effect to enhance the environment. Children are settled and productively engaged.</p><h4 align="left">Interactions</h4><p align="left">Children are focused and confident in the playcentre environment and with the many adults present. Older children clearly articulate their ideas and thinking, are skilled at cooperating and negotiating and demonstrate strong leadership traits. Children see themselves as competent learners and communicators.</p><p align="left">Team members engage well with children and are good role models for newer parents. Adults interact positively with children and respond promptly to their requests and needs. Successes and achievements are celebrated and affirmed. Cultural diversity is embraced and home languages are included in conversations.</p><p align="left">Adults are warm, friendly and welcoming. Relationships between the dedicated committee, supervision team and association officers are constructive. Centre members work together effectively and contribute positively to their children&rsquo;s early education.</p><h4 align="left">Self review</h4><p align="left">Members use association procedures appropriately for monitoring and improving practice. Family input effectively informs annual and strategic planning. Brief progress on these plans is noted. Playground/property audits and liaison officer reports provide constructive feedback to centre members. Spontaneous reviews are responsive and improvement focused, with data informing decision-making.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4 align="left">Planning and evaluation</h4><p align="left">Daily evaluations require a stronger focus on children&rsquo;s learning, identifying the effectiveness or impact of adult response to their interests. Including these aspects and undertaking a deeper analysis in learning stories is likely to support and extend children&rsquo;s learning to a higher level.</p><h4 align="left">Assessment</h4><p align="left">There are limited resources and information for parents about assessment for learning or the role of family members in the process. Including this information in programme displays and portfolios is likely to support and encourage greater parent contribution and partnership in children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4 align="left">Bicultural programme</h4><p align="left">Members acknowledge that te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori requires further integration across the programme.</p><h4 align="left">Transition to school</h4><p align="left">Further strategies and resources need to be developed to better support children and their families in the transition to primary schooling.</p><h4 align="left">Self review</h4><p align="left">Centre members identify that in-depth, evidence-based self review as a tool for improvement is not well understood and requires development. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation confirms this.</p><p align="left">Although the appraisal process has been strengthened to include input from the liaison officer, this is yet to provide adequate specific and constructive feedback on goals to support individual professional growth.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Takaka Playcentre completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-takaka-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Takaka Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Takaka Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Takaka Playcentre is one of 14 parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Nelson Playcentres Association (the association). Strategic and policy direction for centre operations is provided by association personnel. They also work in collaboration with centre members to develop and maintain the quality of the early childhood facilities, taking responsibility for education, property and equipment and providing training. A liaison officer appointed by the association provides professional advice, guidance and support for the centre. The association office administrator undertakes the role of licensee.</p><p align="left">The daily programme is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and soundly underpinned by the playcentre philosophy. Children choose freely from a wide range of easily accessible resources. They lead the direction of the programme and are highly engaged for sustained periods in their chosen activities. Creativity, exploration and imaginative play are effectively fostered. There is good provision for early literacy learning with storytelling being a particular strength. Cultural diversity is embraced and home languages are included in conversations.</p><p align="left">Children are settled, focused and confident in the playcentre environment and with the many adults present. Older children clearly articulate their ideas and thinking. They are skilled at cooperating and negotiating and demonstrate strong leadership traits. Children develop as competent learners and communicators.</p><p align="left">Adults are warm, friendly and welcoming. They interact positively with children, celebrating and affirming their successes and achievements. Relationships between the dedicated committee, supervision team and association officers are constructive. Centre members work together effectively and contribute positively to their children&rsquo;s early education. The playcentre also offers the Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education (SPACE) programme for first-time parents.</p><p align="left">Children learn and play in an attractive learning environment. It is richly resourced, catering for all ages, and set up to be inviting and stimulating. Many natural features in the outdoors create a variety of interesting spaces. A focus on recycling and sustainable living is evident through composting and children&rsquo;s gardens. Self review has been used to good effect to enhance the environment and as a result children are settled and engaged productively.</p><p align="left">Centre members agree that areas for continued development include; aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, further integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and better understanding of evidence-based self review as a tool for improvement.</p></html>
