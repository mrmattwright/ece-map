</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens ‚Äì Homedale is very well placed to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Homedale is located in the Western Heights suburb of Rotorua. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella organisation, Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (known as Central Kids). The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history and the teaching team has remained the same since the 2010 ERO review.</p><p>The kindergarten provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years of age. It is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday 8.30am to 2.30pm, and on Wednesday 8.30am to 12.45pm. At the time of this ERO review the kindergarten roll was 47 children, of whom 32 identify as MƒÅori. Although these children come from a numberof iwi backgrounds, most whakapapa to NgƒÅti Whakaue.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review teachers have strengthened bicultural practices to reflect a stronger MƒÅori dimension. Teachers‚Äô self-review processes are robust and well documented showing ongoing improvement to the quality of education children receive. Teachers have further developed positive guidance strategies through their participation in recent professional development.</p><p>The head teacher and her team of teachers have shared values and beliefs for learning. They aim to provide early childhood education that reflects the dual heritage of Aotearoa. Te Ao MƒÅori is fostered through the concept of whanaungatanga and ngƒÅ tikanga. They have a commitment to provide a curriculum programme that is inclusive and supports the range of diverse abilities, interests and strengths of children.</p><p>During this review ERO did not identify any key next steps for ongoing development that the teachers had not already reflected on and identified for themselves.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 reviews in the Central Kids umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergarten - Homedale is very well placed to provide positive outcomes for children. There are close, trusting and mutually respectful relationships among teachers, whƒÅnau and children. Teachers are strong advocates for children and their families and have successfully established a positive climate for learning.</p><p>Central Kids has high standards and expectations for the delivery of high-quality education and care. Kindergartens have comprehensive operating guidelines that assist teachers to meet regulatory requirements. Teachers have extensive opportunities to participate in professional development to ensure their knowledge and practice is up to date with current research in early childhood education. Through her visits to the kindergarten, an experienced professional leader effectively monitors the quality of education and care, and provides teachers with well-informed feedback and support.</p><p>As part of this review, ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the kindergarten‚Äôs responsibilities for employment and management of staff. Central Kids have developed and implemented highly effective processes to appoint and support staff.</p><p>The knowledgeable head teacher implements a shared leadership approach, capitalising on the individual strengths that teachers have, and uses these to enhance the programme children experience. Highly effective and well-developed self review is research and inquiry focused and leads to ongoing improvement to the quality of education and care. The teaching team is committed to ongoing professional learning and development and they keep up with current best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Children are welcomed into a well-prepared learning environment and benefit from the many opportunities to make choices, and lead their own learning. They develop friendships, and their communication and social skills are fostered through many meaningful interactions and experiences with their peers and teachers.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations for children, and view them as capable and competent learners. They skilfully extend learning and introduce new concepts through high-quality teaching interactions. Children‚Äôs cultural identity is respected and valued, in particular tikanga and te reo MƒÅori, which is woven purposefully into child profile books and the daily programme. Consistent praise and encouragement from teachers affirm children‚Äôs efforts and contributions and support them to experience success in learning. Children are developing valuable skills, knowledge, and competencies such as the ability to problem solve. They are creative and use their imagination to extend their thinking and develop new understandings.</p><p>Teachers have an in-depth knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (the Early Childhood Curriculum) and this is reflected in their teaching practice and high-quality child assessment profile books. These profile books document children‚Äôs progress, capture the complex way they learn through their play, and develop dispositions that support future learning. Parents and extended family are valued partners in children‚Äôs learning. Their aspirations for their children are valued and used by teachers in child profile books and programme planning processes.</p><p>Teachers place high importance on supporting children‚Äôs well being when they arrive at the kindergarten and when they move onto school. A designated kaitiaki oversees these transition processes and ensures children and their families are well supported. A new initiative has been the development of an individual assessment booklet that indicates children‚Äôs abilities within the key competencies outlined in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>. Families are able to share these individualised child achievement booklets with new entrant teachers to support children‚Äôs transition to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with teachers that the outdoor environment remains an area for further development.</p><p>ERO is confident that kindergarten leaders and teachers have the capacity and self-review systems in place to enable them to strengthen, promote and sustain positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Homedale completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Homedale will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
