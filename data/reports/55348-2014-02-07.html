</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childspace Early Learning Centre - Wilton is one of four Childspace Early Learning Centres. It caters for children over two and most transition from Childspace Karori. The director, together with the principal and centre manager, oversees the management and operation in the centre. They employ a cook who makes nutritious meals for the children.</p><p>The centre is designed to support the developmental stages of children using two different spaces. The Nga Puti Puti room is for children from two to three years of age and the Poutama room for three to five year olds. Children transition flexibly between these spaces.</p><p>Since the August 2010 ERO report, items identified as requiring development have been addressed. The outdoor environment has seen many developments aligning with the centre's sustainability focus.</p><p>This service is governed by the Childspace Institute (the Institute). This organisation offers the wider early childhood sector professional development, resources and equipment. The centre is serviced by the Childspace Workshop. It has a high commitment to maintaining 80% to 100% of qualified teachers and ongoing teacher education and professional development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews of Childspace Early Learning Centres under the Childspace Institute.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is clearly evident in practice. It is based on respect, creativity, gentleness, love, empathy and wonder. Teachers recognise and value the importance of learning through play.  The daily programme provides a mixture of free play and more formal learning times. Transitions within the programme are well managed and purposeful. Children access a range of resources to extend their learning. Resources, activities and the environment promote exploration and foster children's imagination, peer relationships, creativity and movement. Children show a sense of security in a homely and inviting environment.</p><p>Responsive, positive, friendly, warm and respectful relationships are formed with parents and children, supporting their sense of belonging. Children's independence and self-help skills are nurtured and fostered. Teachers provide feedback to children that acknowledges and celebrates their successes.</p><p>Teachers use a range of strategies to support children’s social skills. They are responsive to their verbal and non-verbal cues and sensitive to their feelings. Teachers value the importance of relationships and a tuakana teina model is used well to promote peer learning. Children’s choices about individual and group activities are respected. They engage in play for sustained periods of time.</p><p>The planning framework has been strengthened as a result of an institute-wide review. Children's emerging interests and ideas underpin programme planning. The two spaces have been recently <br> redeveloped to reflect the needs of age groups. Environments are engaging, challenging and interest based. Key teacher roles, that foster learning, are well established. Opportunities for problem solving, curiosity and imagination feature highly in programme implementation. Regular excursions broaden children's knowledge of the wider community. Children and parents contribute to the curriculum.</p><p>Attractively presented portfolios provide a good record of children's learning over time. There are frequent links between stories. Teachers effectively recognise each child’s learning and identify next steps. Increasing use of children's views and ideas is evident. The 'journeys of discovery' records show the deepening complexity of children's learning.</p><p>Existing practices for seeking parents' aspirations include daily conversations, bi-annual formal meetings, parent education workshops, ongoing questionnaires and an online assessment tool. Strengthening parent contribution is an area identified for ongoing review and reflection. ERO affirms this focus.</p><p>Teachers, in partnership with parents, have created useful individual development plans for children with specific learning needs. They actively consult with external agencies and work with families to support and celebrate children's learning.</p><p>An effective bicultural programme is in place. Aspects of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are valued and integrated throughout the programme, including celebration of many cultural occasions. Teachers recognise that they would like to strengthen their shared understanding of what success for Māori children as Māori means. A strategic goal for 2013 is to extend their knowledge of provision for Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>The 'Kotiri Hui' for children aged over four assists teachers to seek the interests and views of this group and promote independence. Hui sessions provide opportunity to follow the interests and views of the group in more depth, and support the acquisition of skills and knowledge of literacy, numeracy, arts and science. Transition to school has been identified as an area for review. ERO’s evaluation confirms the need to strengthen the process.</p><p>Centre self-review processes are well developed and focused on quality improvement. Reviews provide opportunities for teachers to reflect on what they are doing. As a result, what is offered to children and families is improved and extended. Teachers are now ready to shift the focus of reviews from what they are doing, to how well they are doing it. This shift would strengthen their reviews and better align with the intent of the Institute's process.</p><p>The principal, based at the Institute, is involved with the aspirations, learning programmes and developments within the centre and provides ongoing support to the teaching team. Leadership is a strength and well promoted. The appraisal system provides a clear process for staff. This is currently under review. There is a good quality of feedback from appraisers to promote growth in professional practices.</p><p>The Institute provides a high level of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust policies and procedures developed in consultation with teachers and parents</li>
<li>well-considered assessment and planning frameworks</li>
<li>clear processes and expectations for continuous review</li>
<li>professional learning and leadership opportunities for staff.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management plans clearly link to the Institute’s strategic plan. There is a focus on improvement through reflection, review and professional development. Many opportunities for teachers to further their education are provided.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and the principal have outlined in an action plan the priority areas for further development. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>extend the transition-to-school process, with a focus on strengthening relationships with schools</li>
<li>strengthen shared understandings with Māori whānau about success for Māori children as Māori, so teachers can measure the effectiveness of their practice</li>
<li>shift the focus of self review from what teachers are doing, to how well they are doing it</li>
<li>review provisions for Pacific children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation affirms these priorities to further enhance teaching practice and outcomes for children and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childspace Early Learning Centre-Wilton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childspace Early Learning Centre-Wilton will be in four years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region (Acting)</p><p>7 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a></h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
