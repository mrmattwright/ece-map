</table><p>Brilliant Minds Early Childhood Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Brilliant Minds Early Childhood Centre is set in the industrial area of Three Kings, Auckland. The centre had a change of ownership, and a new teaching team was established in August 2018. The centre is divided into four teaching spaces. Infants and toddlers have separate rooms and there are two rooms for pre-schoolers. The infants and toddlers share a common outdoor play area that supports tuakana/teina relationships. The pre-schoolers also have a communal outdoor play space.</p><p>An experienced centre manager leads a team of nine teachers, five of whom are registered. Together with the licensee, she oversees day-to-day centre operations. She is also responsible for the planning and provision of programmes for children.</p><p>The curriculum is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and inspired by Emilio Reggio teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the centre, where their languages and cultures are affirmed. They settle quickly into activities after they and their families are welcomed into the centre each day. While adults share information, children rekindle friendships and move on to investigate provocations that teachers have set up. Teachers interact with children to ensure they are settled, and to encourage them in their play.</p><p>The learning environment supports children's learning through exploration and discovery, with a variety of high quality resources. The natural and open-ended resources promote children's creativity and exploration learning opportunities. Children's independence is fostered through many opportunities to make choices, develop self-help skills and use their talents.</p><p>Teachers plan activities from observing children's interests. While this approach helps teachers to provide activities that reflect these interests, it does not identify specific teaching strategies or goals to extend children's learning. Teachers would benefit from support to strengthen their understanding of their role in extending children's learning, and developing children's critical thinking skills.</p><p>Teachers share learning stories with parents through an online portal. The availability of hard copies has enabled access to these stories for all families, and provides more opportunities for two-way conversations about children and their learning outcomes.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from caring teachers who promote a calm and peaceful environment. Education and care routines are appropriately individualised. Younger children have easy access to the outside area for their own exploration and play with older children.</p><p>Leaders have developed good systems to support the effective management and operation of the centre. They work collaboratively with staff to monitor the centre's direction. Leaders plan to incorporate the 2017 revision of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and other strategic documents to develop a clearer alignment with valued outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that development priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formalising the centre's vision, and aligning the philosophy, the strategic plan and the annual work plan with the vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritising whole-centre professional development to build teachers' professional practice and the enactment of the centre's philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing an organisational culture that supports ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring teacher appraisal procedures align with the appraisal policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of this ERO review, the service has begun to take steps to address some of these priorities. The director has provided ERO with an action plan that shows how key next steps will be addressed. ERO will request a progress update in six months.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Brilliant Minds Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>7 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
