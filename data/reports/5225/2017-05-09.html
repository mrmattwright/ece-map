</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puketapu Kindergarten provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. The kindergarten is open five days a week and is licenced for up to 34 children. Three and six hour sessions are offered. Children attending the kindergarten come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. Sixteen identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Some staff and leadership changes have occurred since the 2013 ERO review. The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further assisted by support staff. The kindergarten is involved with the Enviroschools programme.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 24 governed by the newly established Kindergarten Taranaki (the association), formerly North and South Taranaki Kindergarten Associations. A chief executive was appointed to lead the association in 2014.</p><p>Two professional leaders (PLs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the 2016 review, a programme manager and a human resource generalist have been appointed.</p><p>ERO's October 2013 report identified areas requiring further development. These included developing self-review and assessment practices. Some improvements have occurred and progress is ongoing. Teachers were also asked to strengthen relationships with local schools. This has been addressed. In addition, the association was asked to strengthen appraisal. Progress in this area is ongoing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight in the Kindergarten Taranaki Association.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported in their play by warm, responsive teachers. Children's growing social competence is fostered through consistent teaching strategies and positive language. A wide range of resources and activities invite their curiosity and creativity. Photographs, art work, cultural artefacts and visual displays are used purposefully to enhance children's sense of belonging. Environmental sustainability features strongly in the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers draw on positive relationships with parents to successfully transition their children into the kindergarten, and on to school. Useful information is shared. Reciprocal visits occur with local schools.</p><p>All children benefit from a strong bicultural programme. They regularly see, hear and experience meaningful elements of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Association guidance should support the ongoing focus on promoting educational success for MƒÅori.</p><p>A suitable cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation is not yet in place. Teachers have recently made some useful changes to their individual planning process. As this practice develops, attention should be given to clearly identifying what strategies will be used to support children's progress. Assessment documentation should be improved through:</p><ul>
<li>making stronger links to planning</li>
<li>recognising significant individual learning and progress</li>
<li>clearly showing how teachers have supported progress.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have identified that children's cultures, languages and identities should be more visible in documentation. ERO agrees.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are identified, supported and monitored. Teachers liaise with outside agencies where appropriate.</p><p>A framework for self review is in place. Teachers regularly collaborate on child-focused reviews that result in improvements. ERO and teachers agree that practice in this area should be strengthened. PLs should guide the development and implementation of a robust process for internal evaluation.</p><p>A recently revised appraisal procedure includes the use of formal observation of teacher practice. Once fully established this should assist leaders to strengthen the process. PLs should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board works collaboratively with its community to establish its vision, values and strategic priorities. Establishing clearer measures of success should enable the board to measure progress and evaluate how well practices support the realisation of goals and vision.</p><p>The board's ongoing commitment to biculturalism is evident through planned initiatives to support teachers to promote te ao MƒÅori in the curriculum and to develop culturally appropriate practices. Senior leaders are developing initiatives to better determine the impact of curriculum delivery and learning in each kindergarten. ¬†</p><p>The association should establish clear expectations for the purpose and use of assessment, planning and evaluation in kindergartens. Professional leaders in partnership with teaching teams should then monitor the effective implementation of:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>review and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the association should establish a system for the ongoing monitoring of legislative requirements, including those related to health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>improve assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen review and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the processes used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide effective guidance and monitoring of association expectations related to assessment, planning and evaluation, review and internal evaluation and health and safety practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puketapu Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puketapu Kindergarten will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>9 May 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
