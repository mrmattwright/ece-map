</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kuiti Community Centre operates as an incorporated society known as ‘The Cottage’. An executive committee of elected parents provides governance and strategic direction for the centre. A new licensee manager and two new supervisors were appointed in late 2017, and the centre has undergone a number of other recent staff changes. The centre caters for children from birth to school age in two designated age-group areas. Early Learners and Preschool areas provide all day and sessional care. The centre is licensed for 63 children with a maximum number of 15 under 2 years of age. At the time of this review 67 children are enrolled in the centre. Of these, 22 identify as Māori and some children are from other cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The Cottage's philosophy encourages children to be effective learners by taking an interest, being involved, persisting with difficulty, challenge and uncertainty, expressing a point of view and taking responsibility. New staff teams are currently reviewing their philosophies and practices. There are eight qualified staff.</p><p>The Cottage has had a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a programme that is responsive to their interests and learning needs. A highly visible localised curriculum is well integrated in both areas of the centre. A strong commitment to New Zealand's early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whariki, </em>is evident<em>.</em> Literacy, mathematics, science and physical activity are well integrated into the programme.</p><p>The centre provides high-quality, spacious and well-resourced learning environments.</p><p>There are documented expectations for assessment practice. Termly evaluations, summarise children’s learning and next learning steps are identified in individual portfolios. To further develop these assessment practices there needs to be greater consistency to meet centre-wide requirements and integrate comments from parents and children. Teachers should review how well assessment processes include children's learning about early literacy and mathematics concepts. This will improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Māori children’s language, culture and identity are recognised and celebrated through the stories of local Maniapoto heroes in the daily programme. Known as the Maniapototanga curriculum, this includes the integration of te reo Māori by teachers and children and provides visibility of te ao Māori in wall displays and centre resources.</p><p>Positive relationships contribute to emotional security for very young children. The new teaching team is developing some useful practices to support children under the age of two years. Teachers maintain close communication with parents and families which ensures a high level of trust. There are comfortable safe spaces for children who are not yet mobile. Children with additional needs are well catered for and supported. To further enhance practices to support babies and toddlers, the new teaching team would benefit from targeted professional learning and development specific to infants and toddlers.</p><p>Children are actively engaged in a wide range of self-selected learning opportunities. ERO observed many examples of respectful, responsive interactions between children and teachers, and among children. There are high levels of inclusion for all children and sustained teaching episodes that extend children’s thinking. Teachers effectively manage the transition into, through and beyond the centre. Daily planning sheets and diaries enable teachers to reflect on their practice and provide useful information to parents. Teachers are very responsive to the care and learning of all children. To further strengthen teacher/child relationships, the new teaching teams need to ensure that they have consistent and agreed understandings about positive guidance, including the re-direction of children’s behaviour.</p><p>Collaborative leadership has enabled children to experience a positive, supportive and stimulating learning environment through a period of significant change.  Senior leaders are effectively developing a positive and professional staff culture. The licensee manager is highly respected, valued and is knowledgeable about theory and best practice in early childhood education. Leaders and supervisors are committed to positive outcomes for all children. All staff are welcoming to parents and whānau. The licensee manager has identified the need to strengthen the staff appraisal system and to ensure each team has an agreed philosophy statement.</p><p>Well-informed governance provides a sound framework for centre operations and positive outcomes for children. The executive committee has a range of skills that contribute to the governance of the centre. They are responding to recent staff changes and this has further developed their understanding of governance, specific roles and responsibilities. The executive committee is focused on continual improvement and provides sound financial management, commitment to collaborative policy review and generous provision of learning resources.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the appraisal system to fully meet the requirements of the Education Council</li>
<li>further develop their understanding of responsive teaching interactions especially for younger children</li>
<li>continue to ensure consistent and shared understandings about high quality current practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation </h3><p>ERO has requested an action plan from the governing authority that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates against the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kuiti Community Childcare Centre Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kuiti Community Childcare Centre Inc. will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>5 March 2018</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
