</table><p>Glen Eden Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glen Eden Playcentre provides early childhood education for children up to six years of age in four family sessions each week. It also offers two SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children's Education) sessions per week for mothers and their babies. The centre operates as a parent cooperative and is part of the Playcentre Aotearoa national organisation.</p><p>Centre practices are based on Playcentre philosophy of families playing, learning and growing together, with parents as valued and best educators of their children. Centre members are committed to the principles inherent in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Experienced members support those who are new to the playcentre.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified strengths that have been maintained well. Areas for review and development included leadership, internal evaluation, philosophy and strategic planning. Centre members have responded positively to these recommendations.</p><p>A new regional structure for Playcentre Aotearoa came into effect in June 2019. Regional staff are responsible for establishing effective management systems to support each centre. Support personnel visit centres regularly to carry out administrative tasks and model effective teaching, programme planning and evaluation practices for centre members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa, Northern North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They are confident to approach adults and have positive social skills. Children play together for extended periods of time with their friends.</p><p>Children benefit from mixed-age play which allows them to mentor, support and learn from each other as they confidently choose resources and places to play. Adults follow children's lead and are responsive to their needs and their interests.</p><p>Genuine, friendly, inclusive practices support children to respect and value others. Children with additional learning needs are warmly included and the diversity of the multicultural community is acknowledged and celebrated. Parents/whƒÅnau incorporate waiata, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Their commitment to strengthening bicultural practices is growing as their understanding deepens.</p><p>Shared leadership roles across centre members is continuing to build their knowledge and capability. Individual skills and a willingness to be involved ensures the centre is set up well for children to explore and play. Centre members regularly review and evaluate their philosophy statement to sustain the focus on their core purpose of children and parents learning alongside each other.</p><p>Centre members have developed a strategic plan that highlights their vision and goals and provides long-term guidance and direction for the centre. The development of an annual plan allows members to map progress towards achieving bigger goals while ensuring all requirements for centre operations are met. Members can now evaluate what children are learning as they review what children enjoy at the end of each session.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance existing practices, members agree that next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue developing programme planning and assessment practices, using assessment to plan for the extension of children's learning and recording children's learning progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>document how the curriculum recognises and responds to children's languages and cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan for and implement next steps in growing bicultural learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The regional manager and support personnel agree that next steps for the region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing targeted support for centre members to establish effective strategic and annual planning, with links to the long-term goals of Playcentre Aotearoa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the revised Playcentre adult education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the personnel who are employed to support centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing effective programme planning and evaluation processes that support and extend the learning of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glen Eden Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>26 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
