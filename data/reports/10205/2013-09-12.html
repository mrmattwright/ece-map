</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Feathers Early Learning Centre in Massey, West Auckland, is a privately owned early childhood centre. The centre is licensed to provide full day education and care for 49 children, including 20 up to two years of age. Children are catered for in two age related groups in a purpose-built facility. The buildings, equipment and resources are attractive and well maintained.</p><p>The philosophy values and respects the culture and language of the children. Teachers promote cultural awareness and provide good role models for the children. They encourage children to be independent and self managing learners.</p><p>The positive features identified in the 2010 ERO report continue to be evident in the centre. The report recommended that managers continue to develop self-review processes to drive ongoing improvement. In addition the report indicated that teachers needed to find ways to extend children‚Äôs learning and to increase children‚Äôs independence with routines. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are self directed in their learning. They engage well with each other and with the environment. Children communicate effectively and confidently with each other. They have a strong sense of belonging to the centre, are independent, and participate in many daily routines. Children initiate and sustain imaginative and cooperative play.</p><p>Teachers identify children‚Äôs emerging and ongoing interests. They plan collaboratively for children‚Äôs learning. Teachers identify the learning that has taken place in learning stories and event books, and plan how they will build on children‚Äôs interests. They promote children‚Äôs independence and learning well. Teachers find opportunities for children to experience and practise literacy, numeracy and information communication technology (ICT) skills in the context of their play.</p><p>Managers and teachers value the biculturalism of New Zealand and the cultural identity of children. They promote te reo and tikanga MƒÅori well. Children have many opportunities to practise and to perform waiata, poi and haka. MƒÅori children are affirmed in their culture, language and identity.</p><p>Managers are knowledgeable and committed to providing high quality programmes for children. They have high expectations of themselves and teachers. They are proactive in working with, and learning from, other early childhood centres. Staff participate purposefully in significant professional development. They are open to learning new ways that will enhance learning opportunities and outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers plan to make younger children‚Äôs transition to the older group a positive process. They take responsibility for leading visits to schools the children are likely to attend. As a result the centre has established strong links with these schools.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective. Managers understand and use self review well to support ongoing improvement in the centre. They use the findings to make informed decisions about resources, programmes and children‚Äôs learning, and include teachers and parents in self-review processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers are committed to ongoing improvement of the centre. They could now:</p><ul>
<li>rationalise the number of policies and procedures to simplify the review process</li>
<li>use <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies For Teachers Of MƒÅori Learners</em> to support the appraisal process</li>
<li>include indicators, such as those from <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and ERO‚Äôs <em>He Pou TƒÅtaki</em>, as part of self review</li>
<li>identify and consistently use specific strategies, such as open-ended questioning, to extend children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Feathers Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Feathers Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
