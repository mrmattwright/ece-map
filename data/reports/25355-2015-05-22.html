</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Small Steps ECE centre is located in Howick, Auckland and offers all day education and care for children from birth to five years. It is a small centre with a maximum of 35 children, including 20 up to the age of two years. Children are accommodated in two buildings within a home-like environment. During 2013 the centre increased its licence to cater for children from three to five years of age.</p><p>The service‚Äôs philosophy reflects the aims of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and emphasises growing children‚Äôs social competence and independence.</p><p>The running of the centre is overseen by the owner. She is ably supported by the head teacher of the preschool area. There has been an increase in the number of teaching staff following the relicensing of the centre. The new team are fully qualified teachers and are guided by the senior management team and an external ECE consultant.</p><p>The centre owner has responded positively to recommendations made in the 2012 ERO report</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming and supportive. As a result, children settle happily into the centre. Children are well cared for and are actively involved in centre activities. Children are respected and valued and their progress and achievements are celebrated daily. A focus of the centre is to strengthen parent and centre relationships and continue to involve children in the community.</p><p>Affectionate relationships between adults and children in the under three area are evident. There are good strategies to transition babies and toddlers into the centre. These include assigning each child a teacher as their primary caregiver. Routines are respectfully carried out and encourage children's independence. Teachers focus on developing children's physical, emotional and cognitive skills.</p><p>The centre makes good use of its limited, multi-levelled outdoor environment. Children freely move between the outdoor and indoor settings. They choose play equipment from the richly resourced areas. Teachers use local parks and school grounds to increase children's physical play opportunities. They could now review how effectively the programme is promoting physical challenge for older children and how well it caters for boys' learning.</p><p>Assessment records identify children's learning. Teachers could use this good information to group children who are developing similar dispositions and skills. They could plan programmes to extend and challenge these children and also record the progress children are making over time.</p><p>An ongoing focus of the centre is to promote MƒÅori children‚Äôs identity, culture and language. Teachers include events related to the bicultural heritage of New Zealand in the programme. Children participate in waiata singing and hear some te reo MƒÅori words and phrases. Teachers should commit to ensuring that te reo MƒÅori is integrated into the daily programme.</p><p>The owner has implemented systems to help manage centre operations. Self review processes have been recorded and used to promote positive outcomes for children. It could be useful now for the owner to develop a long term and strategic plan. This could include the centre‚Äôs vision and philosophy showing the longer term direction for the centre. The new teaching team‚Äôs shared understanding of the centre vision and philosophy should provide a good foundation for this strategic plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and head teacher agree that key next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>implementing critical evaluation as part of self review processes</li>
<li>reviewing the effectiveness of the centre‚Äôs promotion of bi-cultural practices in terms of outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Small Steps ECE Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. The owner must ensure that she is appraised in relation to the <em>Registered Teachers Criteria</em>.<em>The Guidelines for Registered Teachers</em>.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Small Steps ECE Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
