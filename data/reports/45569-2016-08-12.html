</table><p>Sonrise Christian Preschool, requires significant and targeted support to improve the quality of the curriculum, assessment, planning and evaluation and teachers appraisal.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sonrise Christian Preschool Gisborne, is an all-day centre licensed for up to 39 children over two years of age. It is located close to Sonrise Christian School.</p><p>The preschool's philosophy is about implementing Christian principles from the Bible, the principles of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki </em>and encouragement for each child to acquire an appreciation of their own individuality.</p><p>The centre receives governance support from the Kingdom Kids and Education Trust. An ongoing concern is the centre's minimal roll growth.¬† The trust provides a bus for families who find transport a barrier to attendance.</p><p>Insufficient progress has been made in addressing the areas for development outlined in the <br> July 2013 ERO report. These included, improving assessment for learning, self review and staff appraisal processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A Christian ethos underpins relationships, the programme and the environment. There are strong whƒÅnau relationships. A range of cultures add diversity to the children's and adults' sense of community.</p><p>Children are cared for and nurtured in an environment where positive relationships are valued. Respectful interactions are highly evident and contribute to children's sense of belonging. Families are welcomed and encouraged to engage in preschool life.</p><p>Children with a range of additional learning needs are appropriately catered for. Initiatives are closely monitored and are sufficiently flexible to be responsive.¬†</p><p>A bicultural environment is highly visible. However, closer attention is needed to ensure that each child's language, culture and identity is reflected in planning, assessment and records of learning. Specific whƒÅnau aspirations, iwi knowledge and children's cultural capital are not fully realised.</p><p>The environment is well resourced and inviting.¬† Individuals, small and larger groups play cooperatively. A next step is for children to have sufficient choice and opportunity to explore, be challenged and to problem solve. Routines allow insufficient time for children to demonstrate their capabilities as competent learners.</p><p>The programme and teachers' practices do not adequately support the realisation of the service's philosophy of providing quality education or the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve performance the service leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>design and implement a responsive curriculum that promotes learning and success for all children, and enhances opportunities for them to make choices about their play</li>
<li>revisit the centre philosophy to identify: priorities for children's learning; high quality teaching practices that will assist staff to recognise and value the learning that occurs through play; effective teaching strategies; and interactions that support children to be independent, competent and capable learners</li>
<li>assist teachers to understand the purpose and use of assessment, planning and evaluation processes, using children's interests, strengths and needs, identifying children's learning and next steps, and how this information informs ongoing curriculum design and learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p>The new appraisal process, not yet fully implemented, requires strengthening. To improve this process centre leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>regularly observe teachers practice in relation to their appraisal goals and the Practising Teacher Criteria (PTC)</li>
<li>document appraisal meetings and discussions that demonstrate clear feedback to teachers on the quality of their teaching practices, particularly in relation to the PTC. Use this information to raise the quality of teacher practice through ongoing professional development</li>
<li>improve the process for endorsing practising teacher certificates by using current information from the Education Council, including expectations for appraisal and evidential folders.</li>
</ul><p>Self review and building internal evaluation capacity, focused on quality outcomes for children, remain areas for development.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sonrise Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in curriculum and governance and management practices.¬† To meet requirements the service must urgently improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>plan, implement and evaluate a curriculum that is designed to enhance children's learning and development through the provision of learning experiences that are consistent with the prescribed curriculum framework</li>
<li>implement robust appraisal processes for all staff</li>
<li>ensure the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em> are reflected in centre policies and establish a process for tracking the completion of safety checks prior to new employees starting work.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 43,1-2 (a,b,c,),GMA 7, Vulnerable Children Act 2014]</em><b>¬†</b></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sonrise Christian Preschool will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.¬†</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>12 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
