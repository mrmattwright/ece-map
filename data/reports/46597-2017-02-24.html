</table><p>Tapa Kids World In-Home Childcare Service requires external support to improve the quality of governance, health and safety and curriculum practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tapa Kids World In-Home Childcare Services is licensed to provide education and care for up to 60 children from infancy to school age. This is the first ERO review of the service that became provisionally licensed in 2014 and fully licensed in 2015. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. The service works mostly with educators who are extended family members of the children in their care. Children are all of Pacific and/or Maori descent.</p><p>The service philosophy and vision expresses a commitment to supporting children to be successful and to develop positive relationships with and through exploration and experiences.</p><p>The director is also the service provider/owner. She leads the two visiting teachers, professional development for educators and the overall governance and management of the service.</p><p>The visiting teachers have both been appointed in the past month. The director and visiting teachers have early childhood qualifications, and one teacher is fully certificated. The service also employs two administrators.</p><p>Since the service was established the director has led educator visits, programme planning and assessment for children and supported educators to implement plans and monitor health and safety. The service offers educational courses for parents and educators and regular playgroups for children.</p><p>This review identifies that significant development is needed in all aspects of operations including documenting health and safety systems. The director and visiting teachers should develop robust operational and management systems to support educators to improve the curriculum for children. External professional support will be essential. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Documentation shows that children are provided with a variety of home-based experiences that link to aspects of their culture and home language. Some systems have been established to provide for children's learning and monitor educator visits.</p><p>Educators receive some good initial information about the value of learning in a home environment. This information reinforces the importance of making learning fun and meaningful for children.</p><p>The director has begun working with the new visiting teachers to build educator capability. They should now develop robust systems to document co-ordinators guidance to educators and follow up areas identified for improvement. This should help visiting teachers to support educators' early understanding of <em>Te Whariki,</em> <em>the early childhood curriculum</em> and the purpose of assessment. Records of children's learning and development require improvement to show how adults are responding to children's interests, strengths and dispositions.</p><p>The director works to implement the service philosophy. Parents are well informed. The service seeks parents' aspirations for their children's learning. The director works alongside parents and external agencies to provide inclusive support for children with special needs.</p><p>The director and visiting teachers are beginning to encourage educators to learn about teaching strategies and practices to respond to the cultures, languages and identities of children. There are regular meetings for educators to observe teaching practice, share ideas and participate in adult education. Records should now show how educators are being supported to implement good teaching practices.</p><p>There is not yet an established process of internal evaluation to guide improvement or accountability. A clear strategic intent has been documented. It will be useful to develop and implement a long term plan and annual action plans that align to the strategic intent and inform internal evaluation priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director should access external support to improve governance, health and safety and curriculum practices and systems. The priorities for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing strategic goals and an annual action plan to guide ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and implementing internal evaluation including evaluating the progress and outcomes of the annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing ongoing policy review and development to ensure a complete and compliant policy framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving systems for monitoring children's health and safety in homes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Priorities to improve curriculum leadership include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documenting co-ordinators coaching and mentoring conversations with educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a suitable process to plan, assess and evaluate children's learning and development. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tapa Kids World In-Home Childcare Service completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, health and safety, and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><p>provide a programme that reflects an understanding of learning and development, relevant theories and practices, and <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish a process for evaluating operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>child protection and safety checking that align with the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual appraisals for all staff aligned to Education Council requirements and <em>Tataiako</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excursion practices</p>
</li>
<li>ensuring co-ordinators are certificated and that appraisal systems meet the requirements of the Education Council.</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
