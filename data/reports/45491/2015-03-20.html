</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Waikato Scholars Prep School is a small education and care centre located in a large refurbished villa in Hamilton East. It was established in 2010 and is one of two centres owned and operated by the same manager and licensee. The centre has recently been relicensed for 34 children including 5 under two. The current roll is 22, including 8 MƒÅori children. Children learn and play in a family-like, mixed-age group setting.</p><p>There is a clear leadership structure with well-defined roles and responsibilities. The centre manager and licensee work closely with the head teacher and staff in overseeing the smooth running of centre operations. They model good practice, promote reflection and evaluation, and provide advice and guidance.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to provide education and care that prepares children for lifelong learning in an environment where they are respected and valued. Parents are recognised as first teachers of their children, and their aspirations and contributions are actively sought.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to the areas for review and development in the 2012 ERO report. A new appraisal process has been introduced so that teachers are able to set measurable goals and regularly reflect and monitor their progress. Teachers have made efforts to establish positive relationships with local schools, and have improved the outdoor environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have established caring and respectful relationships with children and whƒÅnau. They are sensitive and responsive to children‚Äôs needs and circumstances and know children and their families well. Effective strategies are used to positively guide children‚Äôs learning and behaviour.</p><p>Conversations are focused on extending children‚Äôs learning and knowledge. Teachers listen carefully to children, and give time for them to respond. They often use open-ended questions to promote children‚Äôs thinking and ideas. Children and teachers learn together (ako) and older children, (tuakana) help younger ones (teina).</p><p>Teachers are engaging in ongoing professional learning in relation to strategies to assist children with special learning needs. These children are well cared for in a supportive environment. Teachers help children as they transition from home to the centre, and on to school. Leaders, managers and teachers are committed to integrating te reo and tikanga MƒÅori throughout the ptogramme.</p><p>The centre curriculum has been recently reviewed in relation to the goals and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. This review has resulted in positive outcomes for teaching and learning, and the programme is now more visible for children and parents. Teachers use their professional knowledge and experience to respond to children‚Äôs interests. Children‚Äôs language, culture and identity are recognised and celebrated.</p><p>The centre programme provides children with a wide range of opportunities to explore and investigate the natural outdoor environment. A particular strength is the way in which teachers encourage inquiry and investigation through science, sustainable gardening, and technology. The carpentry area is used very effectively to allow children to make and complete objects that they can decorate and paint. Literacy opportunities are accessible and visible throughout the learning environment and in activities such as mat times, story reading, writing and creativity.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning portfolios are attractive and well presented. They record children‚Äôs activities, learning and play at the centre and in the wider community. Children‚Äôs voices are captured and recorded, and parents‚Äô contributions sought. Teachers have reviewed the planning process and are now focusing on recording and building on individual children‚Äôs interests and strengths, and including parent aspirations. This is likely to allow teachers to be able to better show children‚Äôs individual learning and progress over time.</p><p>Self-review processes are well established and strongly focused on improving outcomes for children, and fostering teacher reflection and professional practice. Good quality documentation supports centre development, systems, professional practice, and records of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The head teacher oversees the day-to-day running of the centre and leads professional growth as well as development. She places the child and their whƒÅnau first and foremost, and works with teachers to respond effectively to children‚Äôs interests and needs. There is a range of effective communication strategies within the centre, and with parents/whƒÅnau, that helps to foster trusting relationships.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and staff have developed a strategic and annual plan that identifies priorities for future development. Managers and teachers could now strengthen the strategic goals to further promote high-quality outcomes for children.</p><p>Another key next step is to continue to strengthen the use of te reo MƒÅori in everyday conversations and activities, and include Te Ao MƒÅori in children‚Äôs learning stories.</p><p>In addition, the centre leaders and ERO agree that continuing development work in the outdoor environment is an important priority.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Waikato Scholars Prep School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><ul>
<li>The centre owners need to ensure that the contents on shelves, that could topple and cause injury or damage, are secured in the event of an earthquake.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood and Care Centres 2008, HS6]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Waikato Scholars Prep School will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 March 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report.
