</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Meadowbank Q1 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare. Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators to implement and support learning programmes for children in homes. PORSE also supports families and educators with professional development, administration and payroll services. A national team provides governance and management support for all PORSE services.</p><p>PORSE offers two models of education and care: the Home Educator model, where an educator works in their own home; and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works in a family‚Äôs home. PORSE provides a range of training programmes and workshops for home educators, nannies and parents. Of the 86 children enrolled in the network at the time of this ERO review, one identifies as MƒÅori.</p><p>The PORSE vision is ‚Äòexpanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home‚Äô.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of seven home-based network reviews of PORSE In-Home Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs interests inform the curriculum and records show that children take a leading role in their learning. Educators are well supported to identify and strengthen children‚Äôs interests through developing and providing a range of learning experiences for them. Programme tutors work alongside educators and support them to notice, recognise and respond to what children do. PORSE continues to develop and refine resourcing to support education programmes in homes.</p><p>Programme tutors work positively to strengthen the quality of educators‚Äô observations. Where this is working well there is a clear link to children‚Äôs learning and the quality of meaningful experiences for them. Some educators make links to the goals and strands of<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. The concept of ako, reciprocal learning, is evident in practice. Educators develop a range of ways to show children‚Äôs learning in the programme journals, through learning stories and photographs.</p><p>There is increased responsiveness from parents and whƒÅnau to having a voice across the PORSE organisation. The use of information and communication technologies is having a positive impact. PORSE continues to consult with families.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to experience learning outside the home. Regular PORSE playschools are well planned. The learning experiences offered are intentional, responsive and strategic. Playschools and community events are evaluated to ensure they meet children‚Äôs needs.</p><p>Many of the children in the PORSE network are infants and toddlers. Planning for these children is highly evident. Educators and parents work alongside programme tutors to extend children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>Meadowbank offers gym sessions to family, whƒÅnau and educators twice a week. There is high attendance and they are well supported by educators and children from other community teams.</p><p>Children are supported to make connections with their language, culture and identity. Educators are gaining an understanding of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. The PORSE team has worked positively to develop and establish a relationship with local iwi. This has been done in a respectful and authentic way. Meadowbank is building a relationship with Tamaki Marae. Family and whƒÅnau are always invited to join the team when holding events at Okahu Bay. PORSE has developed a number of useful resources for educators to use with children. PORSE identifies, and ERO‚Äôs external evaluation supports, a need to continue to build resources and knowledge to enhance practice that supports MƒÅori children to achieve success as MƒÅori.</p><p>A wide range of learning opportunities, documentation and systems support educators and programme tutors to meet legislative requirements and PORSE expectations. Roles and responsibilities at various levels of the organisation are clearly defined. A supportive team culture is evident. Career pathways promote professional growth and reward study and achievement.</p><p>The programme tutors‚Äô performance management process incorporates links to professional teaching requirements. Appraisal includes regular constructive feedback linked to the personal and professional goals of individuals and strategic intent of PORSE. Development of systems to better monitor compliance with PORSE expectations is being considered.</p><p>PORSE values self review as a tool to promote improvement. Parents‚Äô and educators‚Äô views are regularly sought. Tools have been created and professional learning opportunities offered to support staff understanding. There is a need to further develop knowledge about, and use of, self review across the organisation. Using the existing framework in a more evaluative way to support decisions about development is an agreed next step.</p><p>A recent review has focused the PORSE vision and strategic intent on outcomes for children. PORSE should further explore this strategic priority to support evaluation of the quality of the outcomes and measurement of progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for the service are to continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>educators' understanding and use of assessment, planning and evaluation as a basis for children‚Äôs programmes</li>
<li>bicultural practices</li>
<li>systems for monitoring that PORSE expectations are met for the implementation of staff appraisal</li>
<li>self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Meadowbank Q1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>PORSE has good systems and processes in place to protect the privacy of children and their families and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PORSE Meadowbank Q1 will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central Select Region</p><p>27 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
