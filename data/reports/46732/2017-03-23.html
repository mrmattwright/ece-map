</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre opened in 2015 as the newest of two privately owned centres with the same name. The centre operates from an attractively renovated historic homestead and an adjoining new purpose built facility. The site's original farmland and its owners are acknowledged throughout the centre environment. The philosophy and vision embraces high quality education and care for children. This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><p>The centre is licensed for up to 120 children including 20 up to two years of age. There are four separate age related groups known as Whenua, Wai 1, Wai 2 and Ngahere. Each room has a team leader to support the teaching team.</p><p>The youngest group, Whenua is based in the homestead and has its own indoor and outdoor play areas. The three older age groups have separate rooms and a spacious shared outdoor environment. Children have access to sensory gardens that include an orchard, vegetables and native plantings.</p><p>The centre employs 11 qualified and registered teachers, several teacher aides and a cook. Three of the directors support both Piccolo Park centres as the business and financial manager, centre manager and assistant manager. The staff reflect the ethnic diversity of the community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in their interactions with each other and adults. A high quality environment supports children's self-management and choice to access resources and equipment. Teachers provide a purposeful learning environment that provokes children's curiosity and thinking. Children engage in physical activity, early literacy, mathematics and science experiences. The team leaders model good practices to help to extend older children's learning and encourage problem solving. Children have rich opportunities for sustained, uninterrupted play that supports their social skills and language development.</p><p>Whenua is a comfortable, homely environment for the youngest children who settle quickly with staff. Teachers are nurturing and responsive to infants' care needs and support them well in their exploration. They communicate regularly with parents to keep them informed of children's routines, their day in general and ongoing learning. As a result of teachers' evaluations and consultation with parents, children transitioning in and out of Whenua has been strengthened. This work has led the teaching team to consider how they can now improve children's transitions to school.</p><p>Teachers shared understandings of the centre and room philosophies are clearly evident in their teaching practices. The team leaders support teachers to ensure that <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, strongly underpins programme planning, assessment and evaluation. Key teachers contribute to programme plans that respond to children's dispositions for learning and their individual and group interests. Good systems and processes have been established to gather parent feedback and share information about children's learning.</p><p>The curriculum values children's language, culture and identity. They have opportunities to learn about the unique place of Māori in Aotearoa New Zealand and to celebrate their own and each other's cultures. The teaching team continue to seek ways to build connections with the local Māori community and to support success for Māori children.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well developed and results in improved outcomes for children. Managers have worked with external professional support to build a shared understanding of internal evaluation. Teachers reflect on their practice and identify particular aspects of their programme that they could evaluate further. Managers are continuing to strengthen internal evaluation systems.</p><p>Parents are regularly consulted on a range of matters including the programme, care, policies and centre plans and goals. Managers are responsive to feedback. Many parents express very high levels of satisfaction with the quality of education and care that is provided and the support for their children's wellbeing. This includes the provision of an inclusive environment, nutritious meals and good levels of hygiene.</p><p>The managers are responsive, proactive leaders. They model the vision and expectations they have of staff. A sound policy framework has been established, as well as the development of effective health and safety practices and well implemented long term plans and goals to guide the centre's future direction. Goals are regularly monitored and evaluated. Managers make good use of external resources and professional development to continuously improve their management of the centre.</p><p>Managers adopt a positive approach to implementing the centre's personnel policies. They have made considered staff appointments to provide strong curriculum leadership, encourage collaborative team work and grow the teams' leadership capacity. Appraisals meet Education Council requirements and meaningfully support teachers to grow their individual practice and collective capability. Managers are keen to include <em>Tātaiako:</em> <em>Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners,</em> to support teachers' provision for Māori children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>sustaining and deepening internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teachers' bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing teachers' leadership capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
