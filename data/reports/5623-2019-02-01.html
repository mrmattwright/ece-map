</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road is located in the rural township of Morrinsville. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years. Currently there are 45 children enrolled, including 16 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and <em>Te Whatu P≈çkeka</em> and is embodied in a whakairo 'Whakaaro nui'. This is a valued taonga of the kindergarten and represents commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi, and symbolises people and places from past, present and future, who are part of the kindergarten community.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the governance and management of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, a community not-for-profit organisation. The overarching philosophy of the organisation is to provide kindergartens where children learn through play and are supported to reach their potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten has an inclusive curriculum that promotes positive learning outcomes for children. Literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas are interwoven into daily learning. The environment provides many opportunities for children to be creative and use their imagination. The outside play area includes a range of equipment to provide varying levels of physical challenge. Children engage in sustained and complex learning and are supported to set their own challenges and confidently assess risk. Children with additional needs and their families are well supported. The curriculum is responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities.</p><p>There are strong, reciprocal relationships among children, parents and teachers. Parents and whƒÅnau feel welcome in the kindergarten and interactions are genuine and respectful. There are many opportunities for children to develop friendships. Tuakana-teina relationships support children‚Äôs learning and the development of leadership skills. Relationships foster children's sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Effective teaching interactions support children‚Äôs confidence and competence as life-long learners. Teachers are skilled at noticing children‚Äôs interests and responding to potential learning opportunities. They use a range of intentional teaching strategies that encourage children to problem solve and persevere. Children are viewed as capable and supported to develop their confidence through meaningful interactions and play.</p><p>Leadership has a strong commitment to the kindergarten philosophy. Teachers have time to reflect on their practice and contribute to centre-wide review. Internal evaluation processes need to be further developed to better understand how actions support improved outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers are committed to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and aspects of the programme reflect a bicultural approach. This could be strengthened further by increasing the confidence of teachers to use te reo MƒÅori in their interactions.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement for its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children‚Äôs learning, wellbeing and that of their whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine internal evaluation processes to be more systematic, to analyse evidence, and to more clearly identify improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen assessment processes to include personalised planning for all children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, Central Kids Kindergarten management needs to ensure observations of teacher practice are undertaken as part of the appraisal process.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>1 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
