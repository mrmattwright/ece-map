<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1&nbsp;</span>The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>The Children&rsquo;s Ward Playroom is within the children&rsquo;s ward at Southland Hospital in Invercargill. The teacher, also known as a play specialist, provides education and care for children admitted for medical treatment requiring a short stay or regular visits over the longer term. The teacher works with children from a wide range of ages. Visitors to the playroom may include child patients and their parents as well as children&rsquo;s siblings or relatives.</p><p>The focus of this review was the quality of education. This covered the quality of the programme, learning environment and interactions and the way these contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p>The teacher is a highly effective practitioner. She provides appropriate and useful programmes that give support and comfort to the children and their families. The teacher works closely with children, parents and medical staff to develop practices and or resources to help ease the stress children may experience when in an unfamiliar environment and going through medical procedures.</p><p>A key feature of the service is the way the teacher very quickly establishes positive relationships with children and their families. She is inclusive, respectful, affirming and sensitive to the context in which she works. She focuses on supporting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and development in positive and effective ways.</p><p>With the support of her manager the teacher continuously reflects on the quality of the service the playroom provides. Together they find ways to build on the areas going well and identify and improve other aspects of the service.</p><p>The teacher and children&rsquo;s ward manager acknowledge the need to continue to develop self-review processes and the integration of Maori perspectives into programmes.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>Discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the programme provided for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the learning environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the interactions between children and adults.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The Children&rsquo;s Ward philosophy states the role of the teacher in the playroom and wider ward is to provide a safe, secure, welcoming learning environment that contributes to patients and visitors feeling comfortable within the hospital setting. The aim is that the uniqueness of every child is recognised, the partnership with parents is valued and children&rsquo;s experience at the hospital is positive.</p><p>The teacher has overall responsibility for the playroom. She develops the programme and environment in ways aimed to support the needs of the children and whanau members visiting at the time and for those confined to their rooms. She has the support of St John volunteers and regularly collaborates with the medical staff from the ward.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The children and family members involved with the playroom during the time of ERO&rsquo;s visit appeared relaxed and comfortable in the stimulating, interactive environment. This is due to the teacher&rsquo;s warm, friendly, welcoming interactions with them and the way she has developed the environment to be attractive and invite involvement. The teacher uses every opportunity to promote learning. She is sensitive to children&rsquo;s health requirements and is attuned to children&rsquo;s feelings. She is constantly aware of her patients&rsquo; level of comfort and respects the child&rsquo;s and whanau choices and preferences.</p><p>Other positive features evident at the time of the review include the way the teacher:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deliberately makes connections to the children&rsquo;s whanau/home and other places of significance to the child, for example other hospitals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assesses, plans and implements programmes that accommodate the diverse needs of the wide age/cultures/interests and health requirements of the children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is progressively building her knowledge and skills towards integrating te reo M&#257;ori and M&#257;ori perspectives throughout the daily programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is creative and solution focused when addressing the concerns of children and families around medical procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teacher is a strong advocate for children. She is very reflective and seeks external feedback about the service.</p><h4>Areas for review and development</h4><p>The teacher and the manager of the ward responded positively to the recommendations in the previous review. The teacher is making good progress on the self-identified areas for improvement she has planned to build on positive outcomes for children. The manager is monitoring progress. The teacher agrees that she can also further build bicultural practice and self review.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staff qualifications and organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>equity Funding.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Findings:</h3><p>The service is not meeting some of the Equity Funding reporting requirements.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>In order to address this, the service provider must report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their Equity Funding. The report must be included in the service&rsquo;s annual report for presentation at its annual general meeting. ERO, the teacher and children&rsquo;s ward manager agree that they should continue to develop self review and the integration of Maori perspectives within programmes.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>21 February 2013</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-childrens-ward-playroom-southland-hospital" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital.</p><p>The Children&rsquo;s Ward Playroom is within the children&rsquo;s ward at Southland Hospital in Invercargill. The teacher, also known as a play specialist, provides education and care for children admitted for medical treatment requiring a short stay or regular visits over the longer term. The teacher works with children from a wide range of ages. Visitors to the playroom may include child patients and their parents as well as children&rsquo;s siblings or relatives.</p><p>The focus of this review was the quality of education. This covered the quality of the programme, learning environment and interactions and the way these contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p>The teacher is a highly effective practitioner. She provides appropriate and useful programmes that give support and comfort to the children and their families. The teacher works closely with children, parents and medical staff to develop practices and or resources to help ease the stress children may experience when in an unfamiliar environment and going through medical procedures.</p><p>A key feature of the service is the way the teacher very quickly establishes positive relationships with children and their families. She is inclusive, respectful, affirming and sensitive to the context in which she works. She focuses on supporting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and development in positive and effective ways.</p><p>With the support of her manager the teacher continuously reflects on the quality of the service the playroom provides. Together they find ways to build on the areas going well and identify and improve other aspects of the service.</p><p>The teacher and children&rsquo;s ward manager acknowledge the need to continue to develop self-review processes and the integration of Maori perspectives into programmes.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
