</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Punavai Ole Atamai Pre-school is an early childhood centre operating from the Christian Congregational Church of Samoa in Dunedin. It is licensed for 45 children from babies to school age. Gagana Samoa is encouraged as the main language used in the centre.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs diverse community is predominantly Samoan, Tongan, MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is acknowledged and guides the centre‚Äôs commitment to bicultural practice. A good adult to child ratio allows flexibility in the programme.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2013 report noted that aspects of centre governance and management required further improvement. In response to ERO‚Äôs recommendations the management committee has made significant improvements in centre practices. This is resulting in positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy aims to provide a caring and educational environment for children of all cultures, embedded in the Samoan values of alofa/love, fa‚Äôaaloalo/respect, and tautua/service. The programme provides a commitment to preparing children for future education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Good progress has been made since ERO‚Äôs 2013 report. Positive and respectful relationships between teachers, children and their parents/whƒÅnau give each child and their family a sense of belonging. Interactions with children are sensitive and children settle quickly when they arrive. Friendships between children are well established. Children participate in sustained play, either independently or with teachers.</p><p>The programme strongly promotes and supports Pacific children‚Äôs identity, cultures and languages. This is further supported by teachers who are fluent speakers of children‚Äôs home languages. Children from Pacific Island nations hear their own and their friends‚Äô languages valued and spoken in the programme. Teachers‚Äô commitment to using te reo MƒÅori in the context of children‚Äôs play is also strongly evident.</p><p>Teachers working with infants and toddlers are affectionate and caring. Parents ERO spoke to appreciate teachers‚Äô responsive practices that support infants and toddlers sense of belonging and wellbeing. A separate area is provided for them to play and explore. Teachers now need to review their programme for infants and toddlers to ensure that they promote positive learning outcomes for this group.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô knowledge of children‚Äôs languages and culture contributes positively to children‚Äôs engagement in the programme. Parents are encouraged to share their child‚Äôs experiences from home and teachers share information with families/whƒÅnau about the child‚Äôs time in the centre. Teachers deliberately include numeracy and literacy in children‚Äôs play and should continue to develop these areas of learning.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô planning is based on children‚Äôs emerging interests and community events. Teachers work well together and demonstrate professional understanding of their roles. Good management systems are in place to support teachers although centre managers agrees that reflective practice is still developing. Further support is needed to strengthen how effectively teachers evaluate intended learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre environment is welcoming and attractive. The large outdoor area invites exploration and encourages children‚Äôs creative play. Activities build children‚Äôs confidence and enable them to acquire new skills as well as enjoying physical challenges. The management committee should now work with teachers to further enrich the programme. The indoor environment could encourage greater curiosity and creativity. Resources should be more open-ended and available to children for longer periods.</p><p>To increase participation the management committee has bought two vans to assist in picking up and dropping off children. Teachers transport children and build relationships with families by sharing child‚Äôs learning and development. These talanoa are further shared with staff in meetings that contribute to programme plans. It would be useful for teachers to formally document parents‚Äô aspirations for their children.</p><p>The centre manager oversees the daily operations and administration of the centre. The two head teachers manage the programme and provide support and guidance for their team of teachers. Team building and professional development has had a positive impact on the programme and professional practice. Teachers facilitate smooth transitions for children into, through and out of the centre.</p><p>Significant improvements have resulted from management restructuring. A new governance and management committee has been formed consisting of the pastor, teachers, centre manager, church members and parents. The committee has developed a strategic direction for the centre, promoted the centre‚Äôs vision, reviewed its policy framework and managed sustainable improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for improving outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>providing consistent staffing to build continuity and quality in the infant and toddlers programme</li>
<li>reviewing the provision of literacy, mathematics, science and technology in the curriculum programme</li>
<li>using key values of the centre philosophy to encourage children to take better care of resources and the environment</li>
<li>strengthening the use of self review to identify areas for improvement in teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>To further develop good management practice, centre leaders agree that they could:</p><ul>
<li>implement the centre‚Äôs strategic plan and monitor progress towards achieving the centre‚Äôs vision and goals</li>
<li>strengthen teacher appraisal by including evidence-based requirements relating to the Practicing Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>define the roles and responsibilities of members and the centre manager in the management committee constitution</li>
<li>develop a budget in consultation with the centre manager and staff that sufficiently prioritises children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Punavai Ole Atamai Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice centre leaders should clearly account for income sources in the budget, including how Ministry of Education equity funding is used and information is shared with parents and whƒÅnau of the centre.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Punavai Ole Atamai Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
