</table><p>Honey Bees¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Honey Bees is a privately owned centre that delivers care and education for children over two years of age. It is located on the fifth floor of an inner-city building, which has been designed to provide a bright and spacious setting for children. Most parents work and/or live nearby and many are recent immigrants.</p><p>The owners are involved in the centre's operation. The teaching team is led by a head teacher and an assistant head teacher. The centre employs six qualified teachers, a teacher assistant, office manager, part-time administrator and a chef/housekeeper. The staff reflects the cultural diversity and bilingual skills of the children who attend.</p><p>The philosophy honours the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and children's cultural diversity. It promotes a commitment to Reggio Emilia approaches and environmentally friendly practices. The philosophy views children as confident and competent learners and values children's creativity, fun and learning through play.</p><p>Leaders and staff have sustained the positive aspects and progressed the areas for development that were identified in the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well respected as individuals, and supported to develop a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. They are confident decision makers and collaborators, and experience authentic opportunities to communicate and investigate their ideas. Children spend much of their day in group or individual play. They develop their own learning goals and explore and extend their interests. Children visit the local community parks and facilities and teachers are continuing to enrich these excursions with other outdoor experiences and school visits.</p><p>High quality leadership is enabling teachers to provide a rich bicultural programme. It is strongly underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, the centre philosophy and the principles of Reggio Emilia. Leaders continue to support teachers to deepen their understanding of the 2017 revision of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have embedded internal evaluation for continual improvement. Leadership inquiries have improved the team's responsiveness to children's cultures, languages and diverse needs. Leaders agree that they should continue to progress this work to support children's diverse needs, and further promote MƒÅori and Pacific children's success.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs benefit from a well-embedded, inclusive and individualised approach that supports their progress and development. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively with parents/whƒÅnau and external professional agencies to regularly review children's learning goals. Targeted professional development assist teachers to support children and whƒÅnau to achieve these learning goals.</p><p>Planning, assessment and evaluation processes are well embedded. The visually attractive records of learning and online portfolios are effective ways to share children's learning with parents. Teachers use photographic and documented records to highlight the value of play, and invite parent contributions to programme planning. The teaching team works collaboratively to provide a highly responsive programme that supports children's individual and emerging interests.</p><p>Leaders are open to learning, and foster a culture of improvement based on relational trust. They model high quality leadership through good mentoring approaches, and support staff to build their individual professional practice. Appraisals for teachers are robust and meet Teaching Council requirements. Leaders are continuing to support teachers to implement their own inquiries and promote distributed leadership.</p><p>Leaders have implemented effective systems and processes to support the centre's vision for providing high quality education and care for children. A sound policy base that reflects recent changes and legislated requirements is in place. The 2019 strategic plan is responsive to staff and parent input and includes curriculum and professional development goals. Leaders could enhance strategic planning by identifying specific outcomes for children, and through systematic internal evaluation to monitor progress towards those outcomes. This could include documenting a cyclical three year process that specifies responsibilities, budget, timeframes and review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the priorities for continual improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining internal evaluation systems and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build staff evaluation capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing opportunities for emerging leaders.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Honey Bees completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>8 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
