</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kakano Early Childhood Centre in Clendon, Manurewa, is a community-based centre providing care and education for up to 43 children, including 13 infants and toddlers. The children enrolled are from the surrounding area of Clendon and most have MƒÅori or Pacific Island heritages.</p><p>The centre is governed by board members from the Taonga Trust. A chief executive officer manages this centre and two other early childhood services under the umbrella of the Taonga Trust. The centre‚Äôs philosophy is aligned to the principles of <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Parent partnerships with teachers help to promote children‚Äôs interests and learning.</p><p>Staff are lead by an experienced and skilled, newly appointed supervisor who oversees the daily operations and administration of the centre. She is supported by two head teachers who manage the daily curriculum programmes. Teachers are well qualified and experienced and they reflect the diverse cultures of the community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers support children to be confident and competent learners. They provide a variety of resources and opportunities for children to explore. As a result children are quick to settle in the programme, participate willingly and make choices in their play. Children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They learn to confidently talk with each other and with adults.</p><p>Staff who work with infants and toddlers are sensitive and caring. They know these young children well and are responsive to their needs and preferences. A separate area for infants and toddlers allows them to explore the environment at their own pace.</p><p>A focus on everyone learning together is a key feature of teachers‚Äô practice. Positive team work is evident. Teachers are respectful and responsive to children and whƒÅnau. They provide resources that make children‚Äôs learning experiences more meaningful. The supervisor could work with teachers to provide more resources that challenge older children‚Äôs thinking and extend their learning.</p><p>Teachers model bicultural practices by using te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in children‚Äôs play, particularly during mat times. They also encourage tuakana/teina relationships. Children of Pacific heritages and other ethnicities experience a programme that celebrates their identity, culture and languages. Some teachers speak children‚Äôs home languages to support them in their play, and to build relationships with their families.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô partnerships with parents are based on attitudes of acceptance, respect and a willingness to listen. They value parent perspectives and are responsive to parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The appointment of the new supervisor has added strength to the teaching team. Her leadership is positively influencing the curriculum programme and teaching practices. She is supporting teachers to build their capacity through self review and a more collaborative approach to teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a strategic plan and goals that reflect the centre‚Äôs philosophy</li>
<li>reviewing and modifying policies, procedures and documentation so that they are specifically for this centre</li>
<li>aligning teachers‚Äô appraisal processes to the Registered Teachers Criteria</li>
<li>refining planning, assessment and evaluation practices to better support children‚Äôs individual interests.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kakano Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kakano Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>2 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
