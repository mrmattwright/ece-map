<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The Enchanted Garden Early Childhood Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The centre operates from a converted house which promotes a homelike environment. It provides childcare for children up to six years of age and meets the needs of the different age groups by operating a separate nursery and preschool.</p><p>Most of the teachers are trained. Many have been at the centre for a long period of time. The owner/manager is a qualified early childhood teacher who previously taught at the centre for a number of years.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s focus is on supporting children&rsquo;s wellbeing. The programme provides opportunities for children to learn at their own pace.</p><p>The manager and teachers have taken positive steps to respond to the recommendations from the January 2010 ERO report. Since the last review the centre is now licensed under the 2008 regulations.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is reflected in the way teachers support children&rsquo;s education and care. It is well known by teachers and strongly evident in the centre programme. The nursery team have developed a specific philosophy that includes suitable approaches to support the learning of babies and toddlers.</p><p>Teachers make sure the programme is based on children&rsquo;s interests. ERO saw settled children who confidently explored the play areas.</p><p>Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>routines and activities that are unhurried and happen at the child&rsquo;s pace</li>
<li>the good opportunities children have to make choices about their play and learn to take responsibility for self-help tasks, such as washing their hands and putting on aprons</li>
<li>the range of interesting activities for children to learn about their community and the wider world</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>the regular opportunities children have to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori in meaningful ways</li>
<li>the way teachers support children to play successfully with each other and learn how to negotiate, take turns and share.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use a good range of ways to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills. The manager is aware of individual teachers' strengths and uses these well in the programme. Teachers give each other useful feedback on the ways they could improve their teaching practices.</p><p>A feature of the nursery programme is its unhurried and calm environment. Children benefit from having a primary-care teacher who knows their home routines, preferences and interests well. Nursery teachers are knowledgeable about ways to support the wellbeing and learning of babies and toddlers. These children have many opportunities for close and meaningful interactions with their teachers.</p><p>Teachers take time to talk and share useful information with parents and wh&#257;nau. As a result they know the children and their families well and use this information effectively to guide how they respond to children.</p><p>Recent initiatives in planning and assessing children's learning has resulted in a greater focus on:</p><ul>
<li>making planning and assessment more visible through wall displays</li>
<li>the way teachers plan to extend individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the way teachers work together to support individual children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager has provided useful prompts and resources to help teachers develop their assessment practices. These include clear guidelines on what assessment is and how children&rsquo;s learning should be documented.</p><p>Team work is actively promoted by the manager. She values shared decision making among staff. The supportive team culture is helping teachers to think critically about their practices and the centre programme. Teachers are strongly focused on continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on current good practices, ERO and the centre manager have agreed that the next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>sustain and build on recent initiatives in assessment and planning, including developing more Maori perspectives in assessment</li>
<li>strengthen long term planning</li>
<li>extend the teachers' appraisal system to include documented observations of teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>Managers have also identified the need for teachers to develop a deeper understanding of Pacific cultures.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Enchanted Garden Early Childhood Centre 2007 Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>17 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
