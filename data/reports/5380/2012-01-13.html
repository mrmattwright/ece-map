<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Seatoun Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has extended its hours of operation and improved teacher to child ratios. Teachers work well together to support children and each other in an inclusive environment. They know children and their families well. There is a strong emphasis on wh&#257;nau and relationships. Teachers encourage parents to participate in children&rsquo;s learning and play.</p><p>Children are confident to approach teachers and other adults to share their achievements, ask questions or seek help. They are trusting and supportive of each other, engaging well in a range of activities. Teachers encourage children to be competent explorers and productive learners. Sustained cooperative role play allows for the development of interests and relationships. Hui time is used to empower and develop children&rsquo;s leadership, their ability to question and share knowledge as experts. In this way they share ideas and gain confidence in speaking and social skills.</p><p>Group planning arises from the emergent interests of children. Good quality learning and planning displays explain the origin of interests, demonstrate how these are proceeding and note the learning that has occurred. Literacy, numeracy and science experiences are integrated into discussions and activities. Problem solving is fostered in all aspects of the programme. Music and movement is integrated throughout the morning and during end of session mat time.</p><p>Regular reflection supports ongoing spontaneous review. Association guidelines are well used to support self review. This ERO review identified that teachers need to continue to strengthen self review and further develop learning stories.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Seatoun Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSeatoun Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><a id="3-the-quality-of-education" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 The Quality of Education</h2><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has extended its hours of operation. The teaching team has increased by two part-time teachers. The team of five have worked together for the last three years.</p><p>All recommendations from the previous ERO report have been, or are being, addressed. Property improvement has included a major modification of the outdoor environment and redevelopment of the teachers&rsquo; office.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Teachers work well together to support children and each other in an inclusive environment. They know children and their families well. Teachers are available to warmly welcome wh&#257;nau and encourage parents to participate in children&rsquo;s learning and play. Communication and consultation is ongoing. Children are confident to approach teachers and other adults to share their achievements, ask questions or seek help. They are trusting and supportive of each other. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s physical and emotional needs.</p><p>The buildings invite positive learning experiences. Well set up and resourced activity areas support children&rsquo;s choice and programme delivery indoors and out. Good use of space, with effective indoor/outdoor flow, provides opportunities for children to work independently or with their peers. A print-rich environment provides a range of children&rsquo;s displays, programme information and bilingual prompts. Displays strongly reflect a commitment to celebrating multiculturalism. The outdoors invites exploration and the variety of contours promotes physical challenge.</p><p>Programme content emphasises caring for the environment. The importance of recycling and promotion of healthy eating habits is fostered. Natural resources are used to develop children&rsquo;s creativity and appreciation of their surroundings, including tending the gardens.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is evident in the programme and the environment. Children are well engaged in a range of activities and are encouraged to be competent explorers and productive learners. Sustained cooperative role play allows for the development of interests and relationships. Music and movement are integrated throughout the morning and during end of session mat time. Routines are well known to children. Positive behaviour strategies are used effectively by teachers. Independence and choice are promoted.</p><p>Literacy, numeracy and science experiences are integrated into discussions and activities. A problem-solving approach is fostered in all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Hui time is used to empower and develop children&rsquo;s leadership, ability to question and share knowledge as teachers. Children share their ideas and gain confidence in speaking and social skills.</p><p>Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation, is used to clearly document the process for group and individual learning, including children&rsquo;s portfolios. Group planning arises from the interests of children. Teachers bring learning stories to their regular hui discussions, reflection meetings and use these, along with a daily diary, to record children&rsquo;s learning and interests. Good quality learning and planning displays explain the origin of interests, demonstrate how these are proceeding and note the learning that has occurred.</p><p>Attractively presented, easily accessible children&rsquo;s profiles provide families with a good record of their child&rsquo;s learning and involvement in activities. There is an appropriate balance of individual and group learning stories. Links between these stories are becoming more evident as a result of professional development and a recent review of profiles. Te reo M&#257;ori is used to affirm children&rsquo;s learning within stories. Profiles are frequently revisited by children and parents to share and recall past learning activities.</p><p>Strong links are developed with the local primary school. Children visit new entrant classrooms to make connections and ensure that the move to school is non-threatening. Kindergarten displays include photographs of the school principal, teachers and friends already at school. Regular visits to the local school library facilitate smooth transitions.</p><p>Association guidelines and regular reflection are well used to support the review process. An appropriate current review is about improving learning stories to ensure that individual profiles truly represent how each child learns.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Staff have identified, and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation agrees, the need to further develop assessment documentation to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that there are documented learning stories for all children. Recent monitoring has started to ensure equitable provision</li>
<li>document parent input to the profiles and follow up and acknowledge this to parents</li>
<li>include next learning steps more frequently in children&rsquo;s learning stories.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also identified the need for more robust self review to support continuous improvement.</p><p>Appraisal implementation lacks specific constructive feedback to guide teachers&rsquo; improvement of their practice.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>

This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>All teachers interact inclusively with the children their education support workers (ESWs) and their families. Children transition in with their parents, spending time getting to know the teachers, their ESW, other children and the environment.</p><p>Teachers gather information about the respective needs of these children to understand and support their learning.</p><p>A wide range of external agencies assist in the planning for and support of each child. Well prepared learning plans are written. Goals are set and strategies for achieving these are documented. Regular review meetings to track progress and revise goals are held. Each meeting includes reports by the head teacher, parents and specialists.</p><p>The teachers assist with the transition of these children into school. All children mix freely and help each other.</p><a id="5-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Seatoun Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>13 January 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-seatoun-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Seatoun Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Seatoun Kindergarten.</p><p>Seatoun Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has extended its hours of operation and improved teacher to child ratios. Teachers work well together to support children and each other in an inclusive environment. They know children and their families well. There is a strong emphasis on wh&#257;nau and relationships. Teachers encourage parents to participate in children&rsquo;s learning and play.</p><p>Children are confident to approach teachers and other adults to share their achievements, ask questions or seek help. They are trusting and supportive of each other, engaging well in a range of activities. Teachers encourage children to be competent explorers and productive learners. Sustained cooperative role play allows for the development of interests and relationships. Hui time is used to empower and develop children&rsquo;s leadership, their ability to question and share knowledge as experts. In this way they share ideas and gain confidence in speaking and social skills.</p><p>Group planning arises from the emergent interests of children. Good quality learning and planning displays explain the origin of interests, demonstrate how these are proceeding and note the learning that has occurred. Literacy, numeracy and science experiences are integrated into discussions and activities. Problem solving is fostered in all aspects of the programme. Music and movement is integrated throughout the morning and during end of session mat time.</p><p>Regular reflection supports ongoing spontaneous review. Association guidelines are well used to support self review. This ERO review identified that teachers need to continue to strengthen self review and further develop learning stories.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
