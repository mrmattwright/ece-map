</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Kids Studio is a privately owned and operated service located in Mt Eden. It provides education and care for up to 25 children from two to five years of age with full day and sessional options for families. The service operates from a renovated house in a home-like environment.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes a child-centred approach. Close relationships with families in a caring atmosphere are evident. Teachers are influenced by Reggio Emilia theories to support the centre's philosophy of "learning together and working together".</p><p>The centre continues to have a positive ERO reporting history. Since the last ERO review in 2013, two new teachers have joined the experienced teaching team. Leaders have responded well to the previous review findings and teachers have strengthened their internal evaluation processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed by teachers. Positive interactions between children, teachers and families are very evident and help children to settle quickly. Children greet each other with excitement and develop friendships.</p><p>The mixed age environment is well managed to help children develop their social and emotional competence. Older children show care for others and benefit from leadership opportunities. Younger children are well supported to engage in activities and develop their confidence.</p><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging and experience affirming interactions with their teachers. Teachers are thoughtful and respond well to children. They listen carefully and respond sensitively to help children develop good communication skills. Teachers are well placed to continue to extend children's complex thinking, problem solving and questioning skills.</p><p>Children are confident to approach adults and seek additional resources that enhance their learning. The centre is well resourced. The programme offers good opportunities for children to make decisions about their learning. Literacy, science and mathematics are deliberately integrated during the day. Leaders are now reviewing the quality of their mathematics provision.</p><p>Teachers have useful strategies for recording children's interests during the day. They link these observations to programme planning in meaningful ways to engage children. Individual children's assessment records are attractive and document their engagement in activities. Artwork, group stories and birthday celebrations are included as valuable mementos.</p><p>Family contributions are welcomed by teachers as they continue to encourage parents to add to children's portfolios. Families have good opportunities to participate in their child's education through trips and special events. Teachers know children and their families well.</p><p>Staff participate as a team in worthwhile professional learning opportunities including bicultural professional development. They have extended opportunities for children to learn about New Zealand's MƒÅori heritage. Te reo MƒÅori and waiata are used well at mat times. Teachers are planning to continue to grow their understanding and use of te reo. Children enjoy exploring their own and other children's culture and language.</p><p>The centre is well led by the owner. Very good management systems ensure the service operates effectively. A collaborative and shared leadership style helps staff take joint responsibility for improving the service. The positive and thoughtful team approach benefits children and contributes to a calm and happy environment.</p><p>Policies and procedures are updated in consultation with families. The centre owner has strengthened performance management and is continuing to refine the process to meet the Education Council requirements. Documenting the centre's overall process for appraisal and linking teacher reflection more directly to evaluating positive outcomes for children would be useful.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree that to continue to improve the service and promote positive outcomes for children it would be useful to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consider developing a strategic plan to help guide and achieve longer term centre goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance internal evaluation by using indicators and criteria to evaluate positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>strengthen the analysis of children's learning and the links between individual children's assessment records to highlight their progress over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Kids Studio completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Kids Studio will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
