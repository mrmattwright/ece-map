<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Feilding Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Feilding Kindergarten offers care for up to 40 children aged two years and over, five days a week. The Professional Services Manager (PSM) supports the kindergarten through regular contact and visits. The Kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to the reviews of 25 early childhood education services within the Ruahine Kindergarten Association (the association) umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are highly engaged in their play and work cooperatively for sustained periods of time. They are seen by teachers as being capable and competent. Positive and reciprocal relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau are highly evident.</p>
<p>Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are warm, encouraging and caring. Opportunities are provided for children to explore the natural, physical and material world. Children are able to exhibit their creativity and imaginative play freely throughout the environment. Literacy and numeracy concepts are woven into children&rsquo;s learning experiences in meaningful ways. A settled environment provides many opportunities for children to challenge their physical abilities within a safe learning space.</p>
<p>Conversations with children are purposeful and sustained. Teachers prompt children to extend their thinking and working theories by asking relevant questions. Teachers respond intentionally to engage in and extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Transitions in to and out of kindergarten are well considered and managed. The kindergarten has a weekly play group that eases children into full enrolment. Reciprocal exchanges with local schools and information provided for parents assists transition to schools.</p>
<p>Teachers plan effectively to provide a stimulating and exciting programme based on the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and the emerging interests and dispositions of children. The recently reviewed philosophy captures the aspirations and expectations of parents and wh&#257;nau, and the interests and beliefs of teachers. This is highly evident in the curriculum and practice. Teachers use the local environment to provide follow-up learning opportunities for children to engage in real life learning situations.</p>
<p>The teaching team is highly reflective and works collaboratively. The head teacher provides supportive leadership for teachers with ongoing opportunities for teachers to share and develop their strengths and passions. A focus on improving the quality of education and care is guided by a clear strategic vision and through ongoing, systematic self review.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whilst there is a clear process of self-review, the association has identified that this is an area for further development. ERO agrees and suggests that review could be enhanced by ensuring that the initial question is evaluative and measurable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers are learning about M&#257;ori theories and philosophies to assist in the ongoing development of a culturally appropriate curriculum. Leaders and staff consult with relevant personnel to support them and to ensure their practice and use of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is appropriate.</p>
<p>Staff have identified and ERO agree that:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuing to develop teachers' confidence in implementing te ao M&#257;ori perspectives and using te reo M&#257;ori in practice should assist in developing the bicultural curriculum further.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kindergarten is effectively governed and supported by the association through provision of strategic direction, overarching policy and guiding documents. The designated PSM monitors centre operations, advises on personnel matters and seeks professional learning opportunities for teachers. PSM reports are positive and affirming and provide teachers with direction. Provisionally registered teachers are well supported by the association, their mentors and the teachers within the kindergarten.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Feilding Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
