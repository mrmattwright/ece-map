</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Secret Garden Childcare Centre Ltd is a privately owned service in Feilding. It is licensed to provide education and care for up to 45 children, including 14 aged under two years. Most children attending come from the local town and surrounding rural districts. Some families travel from as far away as Palmerston North. Currently there are nine MƒÅori children on the roll.</p><p>The centre has operated for five years, under private ownership and management. Since the March¬†2014 ERO report, extensions have been made to the building and a sister centre has opened in Palmerston North to accommodate the growing roll. Ongoing modifications and improvements have resulted in well-planned outdoor spaces that incorporate an orchard, bush walk and small farm area.</p><p>The centre has made significant progress, particularly in strategic planning, appraisal and internal evaluation. These were key next steps identified in the previous ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service‚Äôs philosophy is underpinned by shared values and beliefs. There has been a significant focus on bicultural practice that includes key values of respect and identity. The philosophy is strongly evident in teaching, learning, decision-making and planning.</p><p>Leaders are dedicated to providing inclusive teaching and learning that contributes to positive outcomes for all learners. Teachers demonstrate a high level of content knowledge that supports the design of programmes very responsive to children's needs and interests.</p><p>Assessments illustrate and support continuity in learning and demonstrate children‚Äôs progress in a range of contexts. Teachers effectively utilise assessment information to understand a child‚Äôs learning progressions and plan to continue to consolidate or extend them.</p><p>Leaders and teachers value children‚Äôs identities as foundations for their success. High trust, respectful and reciprocal relationships are formed with each family. Acknowledging children's backgrounds is recognised as being integral to the development of a sense of self, connectedness and belonging.</p><p>Teachers allow space and time for whƒÅnau MƒÅori to share their stories. Teachers work collaboratively to include MƒÅori perspectives as part of a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>Leaders clearly understand parent and whƒÅnau aspirations. Teachers work together to respond to these expectations. They successfully encourage parents and whƒÅnau to take an active role in their child‚Äôs learning. Shared professional learning opportunities allow staff and whƒÅnau to grow their understanding of how best to support children's learning together.</p><p>Children are empowered to take increased responsibility and lead for their learning. There are multiple opportunities for mathematical, literacy and scientific learning. Children are supported to develop as confident and competent communicators through ongoing learning conversations, open ended questions and sustained interactions.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to non-verbal cues of very young children. Respectful practice is highly evident in all interactions. Infants and toddlers benefit from a calm environment in which adults nurture them. Positive, respectful and secure child and teacher relationships foster a strong sense of self for the child. The importance of play as a vehicle for learning is respected and valued.</p><p>Teachers are committed to providing an inclusive education for all children. They identify and remove barriers to ensure full participation and access for all. Learners have easy access to a wellresourced environment that encourages problem-solving, challenge and exploration.</p><p>Carefully considered transition processes are supported by effective partnerships between families, the centre and school. Teachers nurture children‚Äôs friendships and engagement in the group to enhance their security and confidence during transition times.</p><p>The manager and teaching team promote high quality teaching, learning and care through regular review and strong leadership. The strategic plan is providing a useful framework for guiding teaching, learning and centre operations.</p><p>There is a strong focus on continual improvement. Leaders have a sound understanding of internal evaluation. It is used as a tool for measuring the quality and effectiveness of practices to promote better outcomes for children. Parents and whƒÅnau are consulted and have regular opportunities to meaningfully contribute to internal evaluation.</p><p>The recently reviewed appraisal process is cyclical, builds on previous learning and is collaborative. It has strong alignment to the centre philosophy and other operational systems and structures. The process includes research and is clearly outlined for teachers. Staff are well supported to improve their performance. There are high levels of robust reflection and regular explicit feedback to support professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use and refine the effective internal evaluation processes to further support positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teacher's confidence and capability in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Secret Garden Childcare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Secret Garden Childcare Ltd will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>9 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
