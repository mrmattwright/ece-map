</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidstown Childcare in Mt Wellington is licensed for 87 children including 20 up to the age of two years. A new owner bought the business in 2015. There are 16 staff members including a cook. Centre leaders include the owner, centre manager, and two head teachers.</p><p>The building is divided into three separate areas to cater for different age groups. The older children share a large outdoor learning environment. Infants and toddlers have separate indoor and outdoor play spaces.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report recognised teachers' responsive support for infants and toddlers, their good relationships with families, and a calm and nurturing environment. These positive aspects of the centre continue to be evident. The report also recommended further development in assessment of children's learning and in teacher appraisals. Good progress in these areas is promoting improved learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs welcoming and calm environment supports children‚Äôs sense of belonging. Adults' interactions with children are respectful. Teachers form close, positive relationships with children and their families. Parents speak appreciatively of the family atmosphere and of the effective communication and support they have from teachers and centre leaders. Parents feel valued and contribute willingly to support the centre.</p><p>The learning environment is attractive and invites children‚Äôs exploration. Good use of indoor and outdoor spaces and equipment encourages children‚Äôs creativity, independence and cooperative play. Teachers provide a wide variety of learning experiences and encourage children to make choices in their play and their use of resources. Many opportunities are provided for children's physical activity, and exploration of the natural world.</p><p>The programme for infants and toddlers is based on trust, respect and individualised relationships. Children are encouraged to explore independently. Teachers who work with infants and toddlers recognise and respond to learning opportunities. They maintain a peaceful, slow pace so children can follow their own interests.</p><p>Learning programmes clearly reflect the centre‚Äôs inclusive approach. Programmes are planned in response to children‚Äôs interests and learning needs, and are underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers work well together to plan programmes for children. They demonstrate a good level of professional understanding of their roles and show a commitment to using te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers respect children as competent learners and value who they are and what they bring to the programme. Some children speak languages other than English and several teachers use children's home language to communicate with them and their families. Children's sense of identity could be further supported by making their cultures more visible in the curriculum.</p><p>Recent initiatives such as the online e-portfolios have increased opportunities for parents to be involved in curriculum planning, and have strengthened the learning partnership between teachers and whƒÅnau. Teachers are continuing to develop processes for documenting their planning and assessment practices. Hardcopy portfolios are an important booklet for children to use to revisit their play and contribute to their learning stories.</p><p>The centre is well led. The owner, manager and staff work well as a collaborative team. The owner has supported staff through the management change. She has developed a useful strategic plan to guide improvements in centre management and the curriculum for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers could further review curriculum planning and assessment by evaluating:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the quality, consistency and currency of learning assessment in children's portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how well planning and assessment recognises and builds on children's strengths, interests and cultural identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the extent to which portfolios show children's learning progress over time<em>.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidstown Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidstown Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
