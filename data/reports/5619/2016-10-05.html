</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Makino Kindergarten is one of 25 early childhood services administered by the Ruahine Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). It is licensed for 40 children aged over two years. Of the 54 children enrolled, 11 are MƒÅori. All teachers are qualified. A number of children with diverse needs access additional support from the Ministry of Education‚Äôs specialist services. In 2016, the kindergarten‚Äôs licensed hours were increased to 30 per week and staffing was increased accordingly.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is 'Tamariki - the heart of Makino Kohungahunga'. Parents and whƒÅnau are valued contributors to supporting the learning of tamariki. MƒÅori values of manaakitanga, ako and kaitiakitanga are prioritised. The Ti Kouka symbolises 'Footprints in the Landscape' and refers to children being guided in their learning journeys.</p><p>The February 2013 ERO report identified areas for further development. These included: refining assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices; increasing ways to involve parents and whƒÅnau; evaluating teaching to determine impact on outcomes for children; reflecting MƒÅori success as MƒÅori in the curriculum; and improved internal evaluation implementation. Progress is evident.</p><p>Day-to-day management of the association's affairs is the responsibility of the general manager. A governing board sets the overall strategic direction. The senior teacher provides professional leadership for teaching and learning. An operations manager supports services‚Äô compliance, policy development and leadership. A management restructure has been undertaken since the previous ERO review.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of eight reviews of Ruahine Kindergarten Association early learning services.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The purpose-built, well-resourced learning centre supports children to delight in their learning. Children navigate the environment purposefully, use outdoor apparatus confidently and communicate a responsibility as kaitiaki for Papat≈´ƒÅnuku. The redevelopment of the outdoor area has supported an increased range of challenging learning experiences.</p><p>The programme effectively responds to children's interests and ideas. Intentional planning supports children's emerging dispositions in literacy and numeracy and the progression of their thinking and learning. Teachers' conversations, children's voice and parent and whƒÅnau input informs individualised planning for children. Portfolios and an online tool are used to document contributions from teachers, parents and whƒÅnau about their learning experiences, progress and successes. Teachers recognise that they should continue to strengthen assessment and evaluation, and ways for parents and whƒÅnau to participate in children's learning.</p><p>Children's learning stories include links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These show how literacy, mathematics, physical activity and science are integrated into everyday experiences. Children's understanding of the environment and sustainability is evolving. Many and varied excursions outside the kindergarten provide children with enriched localised learning.</p><p>Respectful relationships between teachers, children, parents and whƒÅnau are highly valued. An inclusive, welcoming environment upholds the prestige of children with diverse needs. Individual planning and external agency input is supportive to children's wellbeing and progress. Thoughtful consideration has been given to children with giftedness. Children's ways of knowing, doing and being are celebrated within the centre.</p><p>Children are well supported to settle into the kindergarten. Responsive and flexible practices to transition children into and out of the kindergarten are enacted. A well-considered transition process with the local schools positively supports children, parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers agree they need to continue to share information with schools.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is well integrated within children's learning experiences and the environment. Teachers identify the need to reinforce the use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>The head teacher effectively leads a collaborative team. Teachers facilitate a shared working knowledge of the philosophy and teaching and learning priorities. Internal evaluation is purposefully used to measure the impact of curriculum decisions on children's learning.</p><p>The association is providing good support for teachers to use a more evaluative approach to review for improvement. The association agrees the continued development of its Wise Practice indicators should occur, to support understanding about the quality and effectiveness of practice and operation at kindergarten through to board level.</p><p>The kindergarten's annual plan outlines priorities for the year linked to the association's strategic goals of having high quality staff, coordinated services, effective partnerships and operations. Progress is recorded and reflected upon in collaboration with the senior teacher and operations manager. Quality indicators linked to outcomes for children are a useful addition to the annual plan. These should be further defined to enable more effective monitoring of progress.</p><p>The association provides effective governance and management support for this service. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>constructive and improvement-focused support from the senior teacher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable quality assurance processes and guidelines linked to compliance with regulations and association expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a variety of operational and administrative support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective and targeted support for teacher and leadership development through appraisal and wide-ranging professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and association leaders agree that teachers should be supported to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment for learning, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shared understanding of internal evaluation to enhance teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Makino Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Makino Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>5 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
