</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waterloo Kindergarten is located in Hutt City and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. It offers morning sessions five days a week for older children and a shorter session for younger children, three afternoons a week. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 44 children. The roll has become increasing diverse and now includes families with a range of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified. The programme is further assisted by support staff. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. Plans to extend and redevelop the outdoor play area are likely to come to fruition later this year.</p><p>The August 2012 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included: the need to strengthen self review; further develop children and teachers' understanding of tikanga MƒÅori; development of te reo MƒÅori; and review some of the kindergarten‚Äôs routines. Professional learning and development has been accessed to improve aspects of practice. Teachers are committed to the ongoing acquisition of professional knowledge.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in sustained and purposeful play. They make choices from a wide range of learning experiences offered to arouse their curiosity, extend their interests or provide new directions to focus their attention. Teachers support them to problem solve and broaden their play. Well known routines provide a framework to the day.</p><p>Teachers welcome children and whƒÅnau as they arrive at the kindergarten. Parents are comfortable to settle at an activity with their child and talk with other parents or with the teachers. Teachers are respectful and keep parents informed of their child‚Äôs learning and kindergarten happenings. A warm, calm and inclusive atmosphere prevails.</p><p>Literacy is interwoven throughout the day and the programme. It is a strong feature of the curriculum. A well-considered approach ensures that there are many opportunities for children to increase their knowledge and participate and develop a wide range of literacy skills. Children‚Äôs physical, social and emotional development is well supported. As a result, they are confident and articulate in the kindergarten environment. They are willing to experiment and take risks in their learning.</p><p>Teachers, with support from the PPM, should improve their understanding of the purpose of assessment. Profile books and their learning stories are the main formal source of assessment information. These give a broad picture of the child‚Äôs participation and friendships and are informative and attractive for parents. Profile books should be strengthened by more regular entries focused on identifying children‚Äôs significant learning. Teachers should use this to plan how they can add depth and complexity through the use of intentional teaching strategies.</p><p>As an outcome of the 2012 ERO report findings, teachers planned an extensive self review. They developed an appropriate set of criteria, gathered information through a variety of methods and then collated and analysed this prior to making decisions. This is a workable and manageable process that could now be usefully applied to aspects of curriculum.</p><p>Te reo MƒÅori is very evident in kindergarten documentation and the environment. However, teachers need to further develop their confidence and increase their use of te reo MƒÅori in their interactions with children and whƒÅnau. They should consider how the cultural backgrounds of other families can be better acknowledged.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. Kindergarten leaders should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to provide more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The PPMs provide half-yearly written reports. These provide information about how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements and at times, make recommendations. These reports should be strengthened by providing critical feedback on the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations, that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review the association was involved in a process of a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt City Kindergartens. ERO identified that, within the current operating model, the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified that priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle</li>
<li>analysing learning stories to identify the learning taking place</li>
<li>assisting the teaching team to include greater use of te reo MƒÅori in their interactions with children and whƒÅnau</li>
<li>considering how best to acknowledge the ethnic backgrounds of other children.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level, identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waterloo Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waterloo Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
