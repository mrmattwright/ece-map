</table><p>Kelston Early Childhood Centre has contracted external advisory support to continue progress towards establishing effective leadership and more in-depth knowledge at governance and management levels. This support is also required to increase the consistency of good quality teaching practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Kelston Early Childhood Centre offers programmes for up to 40 children over two years of age, from a wide range of ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. The centre was established by the Kelston Community Trust. Six principals from local schools have been involved in the governance of the centre since its inception.</p><p>The Trust also promotes learning opportunities for local children and their families through a HIPPY programme, which operates in the same building. The HIPPY manager is the Trust contact person. Many parents have participated in the HIPPY programmes and some have then trained as HIPPY educators, or as early childhood or primary school teachers.</p><p>Some families attend the centre for short periods. The Trust manages funding carefully to enable children to attend without fee payment.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, Ministry of Education other external support has focused on improving curriculum management, self review and appraisal practices. These improvements were recommended by ERO in 2012. They are still to be fully implemented. Leadership, governance and management have not been effective in supporting consistent improvement.</p><p>In the past month, a new Trust chairperson has been appointed and the Trust is currently advertising for a new centre manager to lead curriculum developments. There has also been progress with strategic planning and professional support for teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is partly evident in the programme. A richly resourced, natural and attractive, child-centred learning environment engages children in play. Children are cared for and are nurtured well by teachers. The teachers' commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi, through the inclusion of bicultural values, is also evident in the learning environment.</p><p>The team of qualified teachers is representative of the culturally diverse community. Most teachers speak more than one language and identify culturally with many of the children. Children hear and are encouraged to use their home languages in the centre. However, teachers' conversational interactions with children should be more frequent and focused on supporting learning.</p><p>Improved communication and partnership relationships with parents should be a goal, to help develop shared understandings about the parents' role in supporting and participating in their children's learning.</p><p>Leadership of the curriculum, strategic governance and management have not been collaborative or effective. Teachers have had opportunities to develop their individual knowledge through professional training. However, sharing new knowledge with their colleagues would help them to establish a more collaborative and knowledgeable team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Trust has recently contracted an external adviser to help address the next steps identified in this report. Ongoing work with this adviser should help the Trust, centre manager and teachers to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>skilled, strategic governance, management and curriculum leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systematic, improvement focused, internal evaluation that includes ascertaining the impact of managers' and teachers' professional learning on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic and management planning, and regular monitoring of progress towards strategic goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective assessment, programme planning and evaluation to support increasingly good quality programmes for children that align with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Trust has agreed to develop a plan to address these areas for development and to provide a six-month progress report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kelston Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management, curriculum and leadership. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Assessment, programme planning, evaluation and programme implementation that reflect <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suitable personnel policies and practices, including managers' and teachers' appraisal that promotes high quality practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systematic, ongoing and improvement focused internal evaluation.<br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1-4, GMA6, 7.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kelston Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
