</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Southside Kids Childcare Centre is a privately owned service located near Wellington Hospital. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 35 children, including 10 infants and toddlers aged up to two years. The owner/head teacher manages the day-to-day operations supported by a senior teacher. A feature of this well-established service is that both these teachers are long serving team members.</p><p>The owner’s clear vision sets the direction for the centre. The service’s philosophy has been reviewed collaboratively and is underpinned by shared beliefs. Strong values and the building of positive relationships with children and their families, support practice.</p><p>Since the September 2012 ERO review teachers have:</p><ul>
<li> worked together to build their capability and capacity in te reo me ngā tikanga Māori</li>
<li> accessed external support to increase their understanding of self review</li>
<li> continued to refine and improve assessment and planning processes.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre curriculum, environment and resources provide children with a varied range of activities and learning experiences. Programme planning and assessment aligns to the principles, strands and goals of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers support children to follow their emerging interests. Adults encourage oral language development and provide sustained attention for both child-initiated and adult-directed learning. Young children welcome ongoing opportunities to actively explore, talk about and engage in these experiences.</p><p>Programme provision for very young children focuses on nurturing wellbeing through responsive care giving. Play is valued as a vehicle for learning. There are ample opportunities for infants and toddlers to be active communicators and explorers. Routines are unhurried and are an enjoyable and integral part of children’s learning experiences.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are well integrated into programmes. Teachers are developing their understanding of ways that reflect and respond to Māori learners. They should continue to make use of <em>Ka</em> <em>Hikitia: Accelerating Success</em> <em>2013 - 2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, to further enhance culturally responsive teaching practices.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is important when settling into the centre and moving on to school. The service should continue establishing positive relationships with local schools so that children’s confidence and capability at the centre transfers to the next phase of their education.</p><p>The manager and teachers work collaboratively to increase the effectiveness of their professional practice. They reflect on the impact of what they do to promote positive outcomes for children, and value the professional learning and development provided to support the achievement of personal and centre goals.</p><p>Strategic planning, monitoring of progress and self review continues to develop. Leaders and teachers have clear understandings of review for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop assessment practices to more effectively highlight children’s progress over time</li>
<li>improve existing transition practice by liaising with local schools with the aim of leading curriculum based, capable early childhood learner conversations</li>
<li>strengthen teacher appraisal and develop processes to provide formal feedback focused on improving teaching and learning</li>
<li>review current strategic planning, including revising the annual plan to better guide future development</li>
<li>develop centre capacity for self review and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Southside Kids Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b> </b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Southside Kids Childcare Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 September 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
