</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz World - Maisey Place is located at the northern end of Rotorua. It is an all-day education and care centre for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for 90 children, including up to 40 under the age of two years. There are separate age-based areas including a four year old room. Children come from a range of ethnic backgrounds. At the time of this review there were 74 children enrolled, including 30 who identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is one of three privately owned Kidz World centres in Rotorua. In 2016 the centre owner developed a new purpose-built facility in close proximity to the existing centre and relocated. The established wider management team includes the owner/director, the education manager, administrator and three centre managers. The team works collaboratively across all three centres to provide governance, management and professional leadership. The centre manager of Kidz World -Maisey Place has overall responsibility for the day-to-day management. The majority of staff is qualified early childhood teachers and the centre maintains teacher-to-child ratios, better than minimum Ministry of Education requirements.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy states that learning occurs through play and exploration and empowers children to take measurable risks to extend their learning. The philosophy also encourages children to take responsibility for themselves to become capable, competent and confident learners.</p><p>The centre has responded appropriately to the recommendations in the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, their families and whƒÅnau benefit from positive, responsive and respectful relationships with teachers which support children‚Äôs sense of belonging in the centre. Leaders and teachers work in partnership with parents to support both learning and behaviour. The importance of learning through play is recognised and prioritised. There is a personalised approach to monitoring progress and development for each child. Ongoing observations of children in everyday activities informs planning and assessment. Teachers share children‚Äôs learning progress and development with family and whƒÅnau on a regular basis. Children benefit from a responsive curriculum that puts their needs first.</p><p>Teachers effectively engage children in their learning. They encourage the development of self-management and independence. Children are supported to problem solve and experiment through sustained teaching episodes in a well-resourced environment. Literacy and numeracy are naturally integrated into the life of the centre. Teachers respond effectively to children with additional needs and support them appropriately to fully participate in the daily life of the centre. There is some use of te reo MƒÅori and MƒÅori culture is integrated into meaningful learning and play contexts. Families from diverse cultures experience an inclusive and supportive approach. Children benefit from many opportunities to learn in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p>Children up to the age for two years are well nurtured and cared for. There are warm, caring and trusting relationships between teachers and children. Teachers engage in one-to-one responsive interactions and the care needs for these young children are well met. Children have choice and can manage their own learning and exploration. There are many opportunities for younger children to interact with their older peers and develop positive relationships. Oral language acquisition and development is a strong focus and children are benefitting from a language-rich environment. Children are confident, settled and happy in their environment.</p><p>Leaders foster high levels of collaboration, respect and trust. They are highly focused on building teacher capability and positive changes in practice are being embedded. There is a formalised approach to induction, coaching, mentoring and appraisal. Leaders facilitate many opportunities for teachers to participate in reflective practice to improve planning and outcomes for learners. Leadership is supporting quality teaching and learning for children in the centre.</p><p>Strong governance systems and processes guide the operation of the centre. There is a clear vision which sets the direction for ongoing improvement. Policy informs decision making and a regular review cycle enables input from staff, families and whƒÅnau. Centre priorities and goals are clearly identified and link strongly to positive outcomes for children. Ongoing responsive self review is well embedded and contributes to the centre's sustainability. Effective governance contributes strongly to positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree the key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the implementation of the refreshed early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> in planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop language, culture and identity for MƒÅori in the daily programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design and implement a local curriculum for the centre in consultation with family/whƒÅnau/iwi.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz World - Maisey Place completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz World - Maisey Place will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>9 October 2018</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
