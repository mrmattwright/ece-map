</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Nest Private Kindergarten @ Clive (The Nest) is guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum and inspired by the principles of Dr. Emmi Pikler. The Pikler approach focuses on children under three years old but has been adapted by teachers at The Nest to reflect Aotearoa/New Zealand and the older child. The head teachers have travelled to Budapest on several occasions to update their training and ensure they continue to offer high quality support for children and their families.</p><p>The privately owned service provides sessional and all - day education and care for children aged between three and six years. There are currently 49 children enrolled and eight are MƒÅori. All teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>In November 2013 ERO report found that The Nest was well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The service continues to support children to experience a high quality environment where they develop confidence and competence as lifelong learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Highly respective practices acknowledge children and the strengths they bring to their learning. Adults allow children to discover through play. The freedom of self-chosen play allows children time, pace and space to learn. The calm environment is set up so that children can create and make, using resources purposefully chosen and presented that reflect the intentions of the service's philosophy.</p><p>Genuine learning experiences are a feature of The Nest. Children have a strong connection with the environment. The outdoor area invites them to explore among the trees. The indoor area is purposefully arranged to resemble a home. Children respect and care for their environment, adults and each other. They are confident to take risks, solve problems and be challenged. Children engage with each other in respectful ways. They are developing genuine social relationships.¬†</p><p>Purposeful teaching strategies allow children to lead their own learning. Adults are fully present and engaged with children. Teachers are supported and guided to provide high quality education and care. A robust appraisal system acknowledges their strengths and areas for development. Distributed leadership recognises the skills and expertise of each teacher. High quality and sensitive guidance from them supports children's capabilities and extends their curiosity and imagination.</p><p>Planning for children is effectively used to guide the curriculum. It is responsive to children's languages, cultures and identities.</p><p>Children experience a sense of belonging and ownership of their learning and this place through the rituals and regular events. They understand their roles in ensuring a peaceful, nurturing environment. Children with special needs participate fully in the curriculum. Play is unhurried and purposeful. Children engage in high quality creative, imaginative play with their friends.</p><p>The Nest philosophy is aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Staff continually reflect and focus on improvement. Self review and internal evaluation are ongoing journeys focused on best practice aligned to the philosophical values and beliefs. The outcomes of internal evaluation show that children engage in learning that is making a positive difference for them. The curriculum priorities for children's learning are clearly articulated and enacted.</p><p>Children benefit from the close partnership between their families and teachers. Parents are partners in their children's learning. Families and whƒÅnau actively engage in centre events and workshops. They provide rich information about their children to complement ongoing learning. A very well considered approach supports children and their families' transitions into and out of the centre.</p><p>Teachers enable MƒÅori children to experience success as MƒÅori. As an outcome of self review the service is networking with a Puna Reo in Gisborne. They share good practice with each other. There is a strong focus on building staff capability in te ao MƒÅori. The environment and teaching practices reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>Self review results in improved outcomes for children. The service should continue to build on the effective internal evaluation processes in place to ensure that ongoing developments continue to focus on improvement for children's learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Nest Private Kindergarten @ Clive completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Nest Private Kindergarten @ Clive will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>2 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
