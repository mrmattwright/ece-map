<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-st-johns-progressive-childcare-centre-no-2" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of St John's Progressive Childcare Centre No 2</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on St John's Progressive Childcare Centre No 2.</p>
<p align="left">St John&rsquo;s Progressive Childcare Centre No.2 is an established community centre in Whangarei City. This purpose built centre caters for 49 children two years of age and over, while the adjacent centre, No 1, provides care for infants and toddlers. Both centres are governed by a volunteer board of trustees and managed by a centre manager and team leaders. Most teachers in this centre have been appointed since the 2008 ERO review. Parents express satisfaction with the quality of staff communication with families.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively to meet the needs of individual children and provide a very inclusive environment for children with special education needs. The structure of the daily programme allows children to make choices and encourages the development of independence and self-help skills.</p>
<p align="left">The environment is well designed and encourages children to explore their surroundings. Children make independent decisions regarding their own learning. The centre has recently redeveloped the outdoor area, designing a garden space and adding a water pump feature. Children have easy access to both the indoor and outdoor environment.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have warm reciprocal relationships with families and wh&#257;nau. They communicate with parents about their child, sharing information and promoting a sense of belonging. These good practices support children to make an easy transition into the centre.</p>
<p align="left">The programme for four year olds develops and extends children&rsquo;s readiness for school and is designed to support their learning. This programme is helping to create a strong relationship with the local school, providing a good transition process for children as they start their primary school education.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers could build on these positive relationships and consult parents and wh&#257;nau more when reviewing centre policies and procedures.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers should also review how they document their assessment and evaluation of the programme, giving particular attention to making clearer links in portfolios to show the progress of individual children over time. The manager and team leaders agree that improving the evaluating of children&rsquo;s learning would be a useful next step in strengthening centre practices. They also agree that a more rigorous self review process would help inform on-going centre improvement and improve outcomes for children&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b>&nbsp;&ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b>&nbsp;&ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b>&nbsp;&ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>

Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of St John's Progressive Childcare Centre No 2 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSt John's Progressive Childcare Centre No 2.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">There has been considerable staff turnover and the majority of staff are new since the 2008 ERO review. Most staff continue to be either qualified or in training.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Interactions and relationships.</em> Children are warmly welcomed and settle quickly into the centre. They have a variety of activities and resources available to explore. Children have established friendships and are engaged in co-operative and collaborative play for sustained periods. Teachers have developed positive behaviour management systems that work to support children.</p><p align="left"><em>Bicultural influences.</em> Te reo M&#257;ori is used in the context of play and teachers confidently use M&#257;ori language in conversation with children. Karakia and waiata are enjoyed by children and are familiar aspects of mat times. Positive, respectful partnerships established with patents and wh&#257;nau are a feature of the centre. Teachers are committed to the use of te reo M&#257;ori in their practice.</p><p align="left"><em>Teaching and learning.</em> Teachers have established good transitions throughout the daily programme. The introduction of a rolling morning tea allows children to experience an environment that is less disruptive. Children can complete activities that promote independence and encourage self-help skills. Most teachers use open-ended questioning to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and language development. Adult interactions support and extend children&rsquo;s learning during collaborative play.</p><p align="left"><em>Partnerships with families.</em> During the review parents spoke positively about their communication with teachers. All teachers speak with parents about their child&rsquo;s day and a daily diary also provides further information to parents. Children take photos of the morning session for their daily diary, providing a visual picture for families and further extending children&rsquo;s learning. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are accessible to children and families and wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left"><em>Self review.</em> The 2008 ERO review identified the need to implement a more systemic, documented process of self review. Since then, the centre has developed a good process for the review of learning areas.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left"><em>Programme planning.</em> The centre manager and team leaders agree that the documentation of programme planning could be improved. It would be useful for teachers to more clearly evaluate the impact of the programme on children&rsquo;s learning. Strategies to enable this to occur include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing parents&rsquo; involvement in the assessment of children&rsquo;s learning by regularly inviting them to contribute to children&rsquo;s portfolios;</li>
<li>providing more in-depth analysis of children&rsquo;s learning to make clearer links between learning and programme planning;</li>
<li>sharing good practice exemplars to build capacity within the teaching team; and</li>
<li>extending planning meeting discussions to further document how teachers could support children&rsquo;s thinking and investigation.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Management self review. The centre manager and the board should re-establish a schedule of policy review. The centre owner and team leaders also agree on the need to continue with the development of centre self review. More rigorous process for reviewing centre programmes and management practices should promote ongoing centre improvement and strengthen reviews of the impact of changes on outcomes for children.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of St John's Progressive Childcare Centre No 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice, centre managers should re-establish a system for appraising teachers annually.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that ongoing improvement would be supported by:</p><div><ol>
<li>a more rigorous self-review process to guide centre improvement and evaluate outcomes for children; and</li>
<li>targeted professional development to improve the quality of planning, assessment and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
