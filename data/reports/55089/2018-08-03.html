</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Mahora is an early childhood centre located in Hastings that provides education and care for children from birth to school age, five days a week. Of the 62 children enrolled at the time of this ERO review, 32 identify as MƒÅori. Separate spaces are provided for the different age groups within the centre. Children have opportunities to interact between areas, in the recently upgraded indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>The service's vision "Nurturing our communities Wairua, Mana and Mauri" underpins the philosophy.</p><p>Since the September 2015 ERO report, there have been some staff changes including the appointment of a new centre manager. The majority of teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day centre operation is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports the teaching team. A professional services manager has oversight of curriculum development and delivery, and a business manager supports the centre with administration, licensing, employment and finances.</p><p>ABC Mahora is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand. BestStart policies and procedures guide operation and provide business management services.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that self review and strategies to support MƒÅori and Pacific children, including responding to parent and whƒÅnau aspirations, required developing. Significant progress has been made in relation to these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two early learning services operated by BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A recent review of the centre's philosophy contributes to a closer alignment between the learning priorities of its community and the curriculum.</p><p>Children are engaged learners who benefit from a child-led curriculum that effectively responds to their strengths, needs and interests. The welcoming and inviting environment strongly reflects the centre philosophy.</p><p>Time and space are provided for children to inquire, problem solve, investigate, explore and take risks. Children actively participate in a programme that fosters their confidence, independence and enthusiasm for learning.</p><p>Teachers build responsive and reciprocal relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. Children's sense of belonging and wellbeing is enhanced through their positive and respective interactions.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have choices and opportunities to make decisions about their day. Their learning environment is well designed and resourced to encourage interaction and exploration. The programme successfully fosters, and teachers skilfully model, responsive caregiving through key teacher practices. A family-like atmosphere supports them to confidently interact with older children and siblings.</p><p>In partnership with parents, whƒÅnau and external agencies, children with additional learning needs are well supported within an inclusive environment.</p><p>There is an intentional approach to developing learning partnerships with MƒÅori and Pacific whƒÅnau. Useful strategies support teachers' knowledge of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children. Leaders and teachers continue to grow their understanding of culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Improved assessment, planning and evaluation has recently been implemented for individual children. It clearly shows children's progress over time. Parents are viewed as valued partners in the planning process. Teachers' observations of children in everyday activities successfully builds a picture of their interests. A collaborative planning process is responsive to the interests and strengths of individual children.</p><p>Online assessment narratives are well presented records reflecting children's individual goals. They show continuity of learning and extension of children's interests and strengths.</p><p>Children's transitions are carefully planned and well supported. Their individual needs are acknowledged and acted upon in consultation with families. A range of appropriate practices promotes continuity of learning for children when they start primary school. Continuing to strengthen transitions by building relationships with local schools is an ongoing focus.</p><p>There is a strong commitment to promote positive outcomes for children through growing leadership capability. Leadership is collaborative, supportive and improvement focused. A team culture is encouraged where teachers reflect on their practice to make changes that support children's learning.</p><p>A recently implemented appraisal framework effectively supports teacher growth and development. The professional services manager and business manager regularly review and report on professional, financial and compliance matters. Their support enables the centre manager to focus on curriculum delivery and improving centre operation.</p><p>Strategic and emergent evaluations have resulted in improved outcomes for children. Teachers continue to build understanding and knowledge of internal evaluation. Leaders have identified that a key next step is to evaluate and monitor learning outcomes against identified indicators. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>A clear vision sets the direction for the centre and promotes the aspirations parents and whƒÅnau have for their children. It reflects a commitment to high quality education. Governance and leadership practices promote and support ongoing change and strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that important priorities for ongoing development are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teacher responsiveness to children's culture, language and identity through assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to monitor and evaluate the impact of practices on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Mahora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Mahora will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>3 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
