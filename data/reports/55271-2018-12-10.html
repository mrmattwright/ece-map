</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Premier Preschool is a privately owned early learning service in Johnsonville, Wellington. In August 2016, the service was bought by Happy Adventurers Education Limited. The owners manage the day-to-day operations of the centre. The centre is licensed for 20 children aged over two years and the roll reflects the multicultural community in which it is situated. Of the 22 children enrolled at the time of this ERO review, 11 identify as Chinese. Ongoing developments are being undertaken to improve indoor and outdoor environments for children.</p><p>The teaching team is made up of two teachers with early childhood qualifications. Both are provisionally certificated and one is an owner of the service. Another educator has a certificate in early childhood practice (Level 4).</p><p>The January 2015 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included reviewing the balance between structured activities and child-initiated play, and continuing to review strategic planning, appraisal, assessment and curriculum. These areas continue to require further refinement and development.</p><p>The centre has experienced significant changes to leadership and staff since August 2016.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Premier Preschool's philosophy reflects the owner's values. Aspects of these beliefs are seen and heard in staff practice. A priority should be to review the philosophy, with the new team, and further consider what this means in terms of teacher practice and learner outcomes.</p><p>Children are busy, purposeful learners engaging in spontaneous and planned experiences. A positive tone is evident in the centre. Teachers are respectful and affirming in their relationships with children.</p><p>Teachers' approach to planning for learning requires strengthening. Observations and photographs show children's engagement and enjoyment in activities. Programme evaluation requires further development and refinement to identify next learning and teaching steps. Teachers need to build their knowledge and use of effective assessment practice to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plan learning experiences responsive to individual children‚Äôs interest, strengths and needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrate intended outcomes of the services curriculum and goals for individual children are achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Daily routines and programmes reflect the bicultural and multicultural nature of Aotearoa/New¬†Zealand. Some te¬†reo MƒÅori is spoken by staff, and children recognise and use MƒÅori words. Continuing to build teachers‚Äô cultural awareness and responsiveness is important as part of the ongoing integration of tikanga MƒÅori in teaching and learning.</p><p>An external provider is contracted to mentor and appraise the owner/teacher. While the process is improvement-focused, implementation lacks rigour. When this appraisal system is fully introduced to all staff, the revised appraisal approach should help to identify priorities to strengthen teachers' practice. Implementation should further consider:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provision of regular constructive feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focused observations of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Practices to support continuing improvement and evaluate progress are developing. Evidence is used systematically to review processes and practices and, to some extent reflect on the quality of teaching and learning. This process continues to be refined and systems, policies and procedures developed. Strategic planning provides useful direction for centre operation and teaching and learning. Further consideration should be given to reviewing the desired objectives in the strategic plan and how these contribute to improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree on the following key next steps:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building the team's understanding and use of evaluation to promote decision-making and improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring all policies reflect current practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to access appropriate and ongoing support for the owner/teacher in his role, including a robust appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Premier Preschool Johnsonville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the owner/teacher should ensure the policies and procedures are fit for purpose and inform centre practices.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service provider must ensure that furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage is secured. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Premier Preschool Johnsonville will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>10 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
