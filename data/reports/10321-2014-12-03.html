</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kensington Educare, situated in the ASB Leisure Centre in Whangarei, provides full day early childhood education and care for children from two to five years of age. The service‚Äôs philosophy reflects the aims of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It emphasises a strong partnership between the centre, parents and whƒÅnau and children.</p><p>Kensington Educare is part of a group of ten centres owned by the directors of Educare Early Learning Centres and is supported by the organisation‚Äôs general manager. The umbrella organisation provides administrative and professional support.</p><p>A new centre manager has responded positively to the recommendations of the 2011 ERO report and has made significant improvements in centre operations. Many of the qualified teachers have continued to work in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their care and learning underpin the strong focus of Kensington Educare. Children are confident explorers and are trusted to make their own choices. They have established genuine supportive relationships with teachers and friendships with their peers. Teachers‚Äô commitment to the values of respect and belonging is evident in their responsive caregiving and their knowledge of each child within the wider family/whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children lead their own learning well through uninterrupted play. Flexible routines give them the freedom and opportunity to develop independence. Children support each other in the centre and confidently use available computer technology tools to enhance their play and their early literacy and mathematical learning.</p><p>Teachers engage in meaningful conversations with children. They are sensitive and responsive to children‚Äôs individual needs. They provide a well considered learning environment that invites children to experiment and play.</p><p>Children‚Äôs emerging interests form a strong basis for planning programmes that are focused on enhancing and extending their learning experiences. Parents‚Äô aspirations for their children are being sought by teachers as a way of promoting parent input into the centre programme.</p><p>Children‚Äôs assessment portfolios provide parents with very good information about their children‚Äôs engagement and learning in the programme. Parents can see their children‚Äôs progress and follow links to their prior learning. Parents report that they feel a strong sense of partnership with teachers.</p><p>Parents express a high level of satisfaction with the provision for their children. They are welcomed to join in the daily programme, appreciate opportunities to discuss their children‚Äôs learning and to be included in the centre‚Äôs community. They feel part of the centre and contribute to centre review and decision making.</p><p>Strong bicultural approaches are evident in the centre. Programmes provide opportunities for children to become familiar with te reo MƒÅori. Tikanga MƒÅori is respected and elements of it are implemented regularly in the programme.</p><p>The centre manager provides opportunities for teachers to grow as leaders by using their strengths and talents. Self review is well embedded in centre practice and is used to improve centre operations. Relevant professional learning and reflective visits to other centres inform self-review outcomes.</p><p>Teachers work as a team and engage in relevant professional development provided by centre managers. Sound knowledge about teaching and learning, and a growing culture of reflective practice, are strengths of the centre.</p><p>The centre is well led, and is supported by its umbrella organisation. The centre‚Äôs direction statement encompasses the centre philosophy and centre manager‚Äôs vision statement. The value of these documents would be increased if key concepts were further defined to help develop shared understandings amongst staff. The defined concepts could then form part of the centre‚Äôs performance management processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre manager and Educare general manager agree that key next steps for centre improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop teachers‚Äô leadership skills</li>
<li>further strengthening the appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kensington Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kensington Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>3 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
