<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Merle Leask Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens administered by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association. The association employs a senior teacher who, as education service manager, is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance for the teaching team. The service is open for six sessions each week and is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children.</p><p>Challenging experiences stimulate children&rsquo;s learning. Positive relationships exist between staff and children and their families. Parents and wh&#257;nau are encouraged to take an active interest in their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds are highly respected and regularly celebrated. The kindergarten programme reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and needs. The child-centred approach effectively responds to the wishes of parents.</p><p>ERO observed children learning in a calm, caring and peaceful environment. Children are confident to experiment and challenge themselves with a wide range of interesting resources. Teachers consistently expect children to care for each other and for the environment. The bicultural programme is strongly reflected in the centre. Children&rsquo;s understanding of the wider community is enhanced by frequent, purposeful trips.</p><p>The association has appointed two new teachers to the kindergarten. The new teaching team works collaboratively and has successfully addressed the recommendations outlined in the 2011 ERO report. ERO observed good examples of high-quality teaching and respectful interactions between children and teachers.</p><p>A useful process of self review has been established. The shared-leadership approach is providing stability, continuity and sustainability of practice and management. Teachers record up-to-date assessments of children&rsquo;s interests, progress and development. The next step is for teachers to specifically plan for and assess the skills that will help children progress towards becoming life-long learners.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Merle Leask Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Merle Leask Free Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to providing a range of experiences and activities that challenge and stimulate children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Learning environment</h4><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s programme provides good-quality indoor and outdoor environments to engage children effectively in learning. Teachers present a range of challenging activities and resources that stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity. Children learn in a calm, caring and respectful atmosphere.</p><h4>Teaching and learning</h4><p>Teachers use high quality practices that engage children and build their self-confidence. Teachers are respectful and fully responsive to children&rsquo;s needs. They actively follow the centre&rsquo;s strategic goal of developing children&rsquo;s social and emotional competence. They use a range of effective strategies to motivate children and encourage their participation in the programme. Children are sensitively challenged to test their skills, make appropriate choices and initiate play. They are helped to manage their own behaviours.</p><h4>Engaging families and the community</h4><p>Teachers use a range of opportunities to engage with families and the wider community. These include special occasions such as grandparents&rsquo; day and kindergarten at night. Teachers use specialist personnel to support children with special needs. Parents and members of the wider community contribute to and give feedback about the kindergarten programme. Teachers positively respond to this feedback. Parents often remain in the centre and take part in the programme.</p><h4>Leadership and team culture</h4><p>Teachers have developed a culture of teamwork that makes the best use of their individual strengths. A review of staff responsibilities and roles has led to significant improvements in leadership and administration. Teachers successfully model the beliefs, values and expectations of the centre philosophy. The head teacher delegates leadership roles appropriately to teachers in recognition of the skills they offer.</p><h4>Bicultural programme</h4><p>The centre&rsquo;s bicultural programme sensitively allows all children to develop their understanding of being a New Zealander. The programme appropriately enhances M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s sense of identity as M&#257;ori. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori form a natural part of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programme. Children hear and are encouraged to use te reo M&#257;ori throughout the day. They learn about te ao M&#257;ori through their involvement in literacy, mathematics, science, art, and music. The kindergarten programme strongly links to M&#257;ori concepts such as whanaungatanga (what it means to be family) and kaitiakitanga (caring for each other and for the environment).</p><h4>Self review</h4><p>Teachers have a useful structure for self review. They skilfully use findings to develop an action plan that leads to improving outcomes for children. The appraisal process has clear goals and guidelines and is based on the professional standards and satisfactory teacher criteria. Teachers&rsquo; appraisal goals are appropriately linked to the centre&rsquo;s strategic goals and include comprehensive evidence, record keeping and feedback to staff.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><h4>Assessment</h4><p>In the children&rsquo;s portfolios, teachers describe activities used to stimulate children&rsquo;s participation in play. They identify the knowledge children gain from the themed programmes such as kaitiakitanga. Teachers now need to assess all aspects of children&rsquo;s learning more consistently and ensure that next learning steps are planned for each child.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Merle Leask Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>15 June 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-merle-leask-free-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Merle Leask Free Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Merle Leask Free Kindergarten.</p><p>Merle Leask Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens administered by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association. The association employs a senior teacher who, as education service manager, is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance for the teaching team. The service is open for six sessions each week and is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children.</p><p>Challenging experiences stimulate children&rsquo;s learning. Positive relationships exist between staff and children and their families. Parents and wh&#257;nau are encouraged to take an active interest in their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds are highly respected and regularly celebrated. The kindergarten programme reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and needs. The child-centred approach effectively responds to the wishes of parents.</p><p>ERO observed children learning in a calm, caring and peaceful environment. Children are confident to experiment and challenge themselves with a wide range of interesting resources. Teachers consistently expect children to care for each other and for the environment. The bicultural programme is strongly reflected in the centre. Children&rsquo;s understanding of the wider community is enhanced by frequent, purposeful trips.</p><p>The association has appointed two new teachers to the kindergarten. The new teaching team works collaboratively and has successfully addressed the recommendations outlined in the 2011 ERO report. ERO observed good examples of high-quality teaching and respectful interactions between children and teachers.</p><p>A useful process of self review has been established. The shared-leadership approach is providing stability, continuity and sustainability of practice and management. Teachers record up-to-date assessments of children&rsquo;s interests, progress and development. The next step is for teachers to specifically plan for and assess the skills that will help children progress towards becoming life-long learners.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of kindergarten&rsquo;s performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this kindergarten.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this kindergarten.</p></html>
