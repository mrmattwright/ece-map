</table><p>Plimmerton Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Plimmerton Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 40 children aged over two years. A small number of MƒÅori children attend the service.</p><p>Since the June 2015 ERO report, a new teaching team has been established. The kindergarten philosophy was being reviewed at this time. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>Plimmerton Kindergarten is governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association (the association). The chief executive and a board of trustees are responsible for governance. A team of senior teachers oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The association governs 102 kindergartens which includes three Pasifika kindergartens and a Pasifika home-based service with two networks.</p><p>ERO's June 2015 report identified areas requiring further development. These included self review, teacher inquiry, and promoting MƒÅori children's success as MƒÅori. The service has made good progress in these areas.</p><p>Progress has been made by the association to improve the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p><p>This review was one of nine in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from many authentic opportunities to explore, create, investigate and have fun. Independent and sustained play is evident. They are confident learners and are having increased opportunities to lead their learning. Teachers are positive and respectful in their interactions with children. They work alongside them providing challenge and support to extend their interests and confidence.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori features strongly in the curriculum. Authentic learning opportunities are provided for teachers and children to experience te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Regular external expertise provides opportunities for children to lead their own learning and for teachers to continue to build their capability. Teachers should continue to deepen their knowledge and understanding of local history and sites of significance for MƒÅori and embed this into their programmes and practices.</p><p>Effective planning for learning framework guides teacher practice and is based on children‚Äôs emerging interests. Children's assessment portfolios record children's interests and participation in group and individual learning. Parent aspirations are sought and visible in some learning stories. A next step is for teachers to embed and make visible to more consistently show in learning records parent input and planned teaching strategies that extend children's learning. Acknowledging family cultures, languages and identities in their teaching practices and records of children's learning should continue to be strengthened.</p><p>Children with additional needs are identified and effectively supported with agency assistance, if required, and individual development plans. Teachers agree that strengthening assessment documentation to show how they are working collaboratively with families to progress these children's development and learning is a key next step.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are collaborative and reflective. Building a shared understanding of internal evaluation that focuses on how well practices support improvement to learning should better inform decision making about change.</p><p>A well-considered appraisal process has recently been enhanced to grow and develop teacher practice. Teachers inquire into the effectiveness of their teaching and reflect on their practice. Purposeful appraisal goals focus on improving aspects of leadership and practice to support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. They successfully foster collective sense of responsibility to implement the vision, values and mission of the association. Systems and processes have been well developed to guide teacher‚Äôs capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Senior leaders work effectively together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Well-considered resource allocation supports and enhances children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment documentation to clearly align with association expectations in Te Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build a shared understanding of internal evaluation to better identify the impact of teaching on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and senior leaders agree that the association's next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to follow the strategic direction set through T≈´manako, Te Tiriti o Waitangi Based Strategic Priority Framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Plimmerton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service leaders should monitor implementation of the kindergartens supervision plan.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>16 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
