</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glenbrook Kindergarten is a well-established kindergarten licensed for 30 children two years of age and over. The service has recently changed its opening hours to 8am to 5pm.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) and operates under its policies and management framework. A CMKA education manager (EM) visits the kindergarten and provides leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The CMKA is in the process of reviewing its structures and operational framework.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy of the kindergarten emphasises learning through play and enhancing teachable moments. Teachers have a focus on promoting environmental sustainability. The kindergarten's new teaching team includes an experienced head teacher, two other registered teachers, an administrator, and a teacher aide.</p><p>In 2015, ERO identified a variety of good practices. Areas for improvement included planning, assessment and self review. Some good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the CMKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be confident and engaged in their learning. They demonstrate a sound sense of belonging and are friendly and communicative as they approach friends, teachers and visitors. Children move freely within indoor and outdoor play spaces. They choose from a wide variety of relevant, interesting and accessible resources in a well-prepared environment.</p><p>Teachers support children's learning and wellbeing by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring routines are non-intrusive and flexible, providing time for children to engage in uninterrupted play and exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respectfully monitoring and talking to children about their needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>empowering children to take increased responsibility for themselves and their wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encouraging children's verbal communication.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers promote tikanga MƒÅori in consultation with local iwi. They are developing their bicultural practices and continuing to gain confidence in using te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers welcome all children, their whƒÅnau and visitors. Parents enjoy opportunities to stay and settle their children. Parents who spoke with ERO talked about their satisfaction with children's experiences and participation in the kindergarten programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are engaging with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum. They are exploring learning priorities at the kindergarten, and with parents, whƒÅnau and children. Children's learning experiences are based on enquiry learning, bicultural practice and the 'enviro-schools' kaupapa.</p><p>Teachers regularly assess children's learning. Some assessments reflect children's backgrounds. Teachers have improved assessments to include more of a focus on individual learning, analysis of observations and identifying children's dispositions for learning. Teachers acknowledge that building further on dispositional learning could help them to make children's continuity of learning and progress more visible.</p><p>Teachers plan the curriculum collaboratively, and value children's voices and their contributions to the programme. Leaders and teachers are working to establish and embed a new planning process.</p><p>A useful framework guides collaborative internal evaluation. Teachers discuss and reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices. They regularly engage in review and access relevant professional learning to improve their practice. To further evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching practice, teachers could measure the extent to which their practice reflects the recently developed philosophy and the Education Council's standards for teaching.</p><p>CMKA strategic goals and the kindergarten's annual planning guide improvements in teaching practice, learning environments and outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau. Continued support by CMKA personnel for the further development of the head teacher's leadership skills would help her to lead improvements in teaching practices.</p><p>Well-established CMKA management systems, policies and processes guide the kindergarten's practices. Embedding the practice of regular documented observations into CMKA appraisal processes would enhance the support provided for teachers' professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include continuing to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the extent to which teachers support children to increase the complexity of their play, and extend and challenge children's thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of learning and teaching to show the impact of teaching practice on children's learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' effectiveness in promoting the kindergarten's learning priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>CMKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing consistent ongoing support for leaders and teachers that sustains leadership and improves teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, to identify priorities for learning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to increase the visibility of children's cultural identity and continuity of learning in their individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability and depth in internal evaluation across the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glenbrook Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glenbrook Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
