<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Kiwi Kids Childcare Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the March 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>administration and management</li>
<li>professional practice</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>compliance with requirements for managing personnel and health and safety</li>
<li>any other matters that may be identified during the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Kids Childcare is licensed to provide all day education and care for a maximum of 47 children up to the age of five years, including 12 under the age of two. Situated on a large site adjacent to a community park in southern Karori, the outdoors area has a country-like feel. The large building offers spacious areas for indoor play and opportunity for expansion. This is the centre‚Äôs fifth review in seven years and its fourth supplementary review. The centre was operating under a transitional licence at the time of this ERO review.</p><p>During the March 2012 review, ERO identified areas for improvement in administration and management. These included making deliberate links between the strategic plan, annual plan and the professional learning and development provided for teachers. The need for development of performance management and appraisal processes, including processes for ensuring provisionally registered teachers reach the registration criteria, was also identified.</p><p>Professional practices were identified as requiring development. This involved developing the approach to assessment, planning and evaluation and strengthening assessment of children's progress, including the recording of this learning in their portfolios.</p><p>For effective self review, the centre needed to develop a clear framework to include regular review and implementation of policies. In addition the need to develop processes for undertaking regular review of aspects of centre operation leading to ongoing improvement was identified.</p><p>Compliance issues relating to the non-completion of appraisal processes for teachers and the manager and inadequate hazard identification and remediation processes were also identified.</p><p>Since the 2012 review, there have been a number of changes. The centre is now under the ownership of one director. An administrator is employed to assist with day-to-day administration. This allows the director to spend more time addressing professional issues. A qualified teacher was employed late 2012 and, in addition, there were three new teachers hired in February 2013. These teachers are in varying stages of their training. An external consultant has worked with centre personnel to begin an improvement process.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><h4>Administration and management</h4><p>The impact of the external consultant‚Äôs involvement has been positive. During a recent relicensing visit, the Ministry of Education identified the need for professional development in the areas of programme planning and self review. The consultant's employment has been continued to provide professional development in these areas and to mentor the manager and all teachers.</p><p>Planning and development are aligned. Connections between strategic direction, annual actions and teachers' professional development are deliberate. Goals and objectives focus on supporting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>A new appraisal process has been implemented. This clearly identifies centre-wide and individual teacher development goals. Professional learning targets these goals. Implementation of support programmes for teachers in training has begun.</p><h4>Professional practice</h4><p>The impact of professional development focused on assessment practice is evident in documented planning processes. Teachers identify children‚Äôs learning over time and next possibilities for extending their learning and development.</p><p>Steps have been taken to enrich the curriculum. A key strategic goal focuses on the development of organic gardens to widen the experiences of children and whƒÅnau by learning about sustainability. The owner provides valuable guidance to teachers and children on respectful bicultural practices. Te¬†reo me nga tikanga MƒÅori are strongly evident throughout the centre and within the programme. The language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children attending, and of their whƒÅnau, are upheld.</p><p>Communication with parents about the programme and centre events has been improved by the development of a website that shares what is happening.</p><h4>Self review</h4><p>Short-term reviews of routines and learning areas have been undertaken to seek ways to improve provision for children. Planned review of policies has yet to occur. The order in which policies will be reviewed has now been prioritised so that this takes place within a meaningful context.</p><h4>Compliance Matters</h4><p>Staff appraisals are now in place and have been completed for all permanent, full-time teachers. These are robust and include the registered teacher criteria and relevant feedback to individuals. Appraisal of part-time staff is underway with teachers setting development goals.</p><p>All identified health and safety issues have now been addressed. The indoor areas have been upgraded. Improvements to the infants' and toddlers' areas were nearing completion at the time ERO was on site. Processes for identifying and addressing hazards identification are carried out routinely.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Areas still needing further development are:</p><ul>
<li>understanding of the purpose and process of self review and its robust implementation</li>
<li>policy review</li>
<li>planning and evaluation of the effectiveness of programmes</li>
<li>processes for supporting provisionally registered teachers to meet full registration requirements.</li>
</ul><p>In addition ERO identified the following areas of concern:</p><ul>
<li>interactions between teachers and children are of variable quality</li>
<li>the positive guidance practices of some staff need improvement.</li>
</ul><a id="3-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><ul>
<li>the centre manager develop, and robustly implement, documented procedures and sustainable systems leading to continuous improvement</li>
<li>the manager and teachers work together to continue development of the approach to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>the manager and teachers continue to develop a centre-wide approach to positive guidance of children‚Äôs behaviour</li>
<li>the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develop a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</li>
</ul><a id="4-action-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Action Required for Compliance</h2><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must:</p><ul>
<li>further develop programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices.¬†<em>[Source: Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood and Care Centres 2008, C2]</em></li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO intends to return to the centre within 24 months to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>7 August 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
