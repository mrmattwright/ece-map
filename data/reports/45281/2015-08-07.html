</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Just Kidz Educare - University is a large privately owned early childhood service located in the grounds of Colin Maiden Park in St Johns, East Auckland. The centre is licensed for 75 children, including up to 25 infants and toddlers under two years of age. There is currently a good ratio of qualified teachers within the centre, half of whom are fully registered teachers.</p><p>The centre offers full day and sessional choices for parents, including the Ministry of Education‚Äôs 20 free hours option. The centre is purpose built and well equipped. The separate facilities for infants and toddlers are spacious and provide these young children with good access to covered and outdoor areas. Children over two years enjoy well organised, mixed-age play.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2012 report identified good quality education and care practices. Since that time there has been a significant turnover of staff, including three changes in centre management. These changes have had some impact on limiting centre development and self review.</p><p>The centre owners have recently re-appointed a manager with previous experience of leading the centre, together with a new assistant manager and several new teachers. The new management team are now rebuilding the teaching team and strengthening the learning programme. Priorities are to now improve communication and processes for evaluating the quality of centre practices.</p><a id="2-the-review-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Review Findings</h2><p>Children and families are warmly greeted on arrival. Teachers settle children quickly and take time to talk with parents. Children make friends with each other and have trusting relationships with teachers. Infants and toddlers have primary care givers who follow their individual routines and provide them with continuity of care throughout the day.</p><p>Children are provided with good resources to support their play. They can access equipment independently and are confident to ask teachers for support. Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and requests. They have good conversations with children and encourage their use of oral language.</p><p>Teachers have set up the environment in ways that encourage children‚Äôs social, creative and physical play. Literacy and numeracy learning is included in daily programmes. Children can move easily between all areas of play and are able to sustain their play during the morning with minimal interruption.</p><p>Babies and toddlers have a large open area to explore and many appropriate resources to investigate. All children can access their portfolios and enjoy the displays of photographs around the walls that relate to centre activities. Children enjoy planned group sessions, shared books and musical activities.</p><p>The centre offers a positive homely environment that nurtures children and contributes to their wellbeing. Centre routines are carefully managed and documented. Sleeping arrangements for babies and older children are quiet and well supervised. Meal times are enjoyable and children are provided with healthy food choices.</p><p>The work of the teaching team continues to develop. Given that several new teachers have recently joined the staff, centre leaders now need to build staff capacity to work together as a team to strengthen programme planning and self review. They need to provide leadership and guidance to help teachers develop more consistent planning, assessment and evaluation practices.</p><p>Performance appraisal procedures have yet to be completed as most teachers have not completed a full year at the centre. These procedures should be shared with teachers and systems for supporting provisionally registered teachers (PRTs) should be formalised. The centre manager plans to review the centre philosophy as a starting point for building a collaborative professional culture.</p><p>The centre manager and licensee should also seek advice about the effective use of strategic and annual planning. They should develop plans and goals relating to the quality of children‚Äôs care and education, and to progress aims for further improving teaching practice. Consulting parents and staff would provide useful information for guiding the development of plans and goals. It would also be useful for evaluating progress made against strategic and annual plans and goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends that the licensee seek professional support to develop action plans and goals to strengthen centre management and leadership. The plans should include steps for:</p><ul>
<li>supporting centre leaders to continue building a collaborative, reflective teaching team</li>
<li>further building shared teacher understandings of child-centred programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>further improving the use of observations and learning stories to identify children‚Äôs dispositions and interests</li>
<li>seeking staff and parents‚Äô feedback about centre operations and outcomes for children</li>
<li>developing a systematic process for reviewing progress against action plan goals.</li>
</ul><p>Well considered and effective work in the above areas should promote ongoing improvement and sustainable centre development.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Kidz Educare - University completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. To further improve practice in this centre, centre leaders should take steps to improve understandings about early childhood regulations relating to the privacy of information.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Just Kidz Educare - University will be within two years.¬†</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>7 August 2015</p><div>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
