</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Rototuna operates under the ownership of Kidicorp Ltd. It is licensed to provide education and care for a maximum of 50 children from birth to school age. Up to 14 of the children may be under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 67 children were enrolled, of whom 12 are identified as MƒÅori. The centre also includes children from a range of ethnicities, and is located in Rototuna, a north eastern suburb of Hamilton.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review the centre has refurbished the indoor playrooms and begun to redevelop the outdoor areas. A new assistant manager has been appointed, and new teachers have been appointed to the babies‚Äô area of the centre. The centre has made progress in addressing areas identified for further development in the last review. Children‚Äôs transition from the babies‚Äô area to the toddlers‚Äô is well-managed, and teaching practice is now focused more on extending children‚Äôs learning. Partnerships with parents are making valuable contributions to the programme‚Äôs responsiveness to children.</p><p>The centre philosophy values the provision of a warm, secure and caring environment where children and their parents/whƒÅnau are welcomed and supported. Teachers encourage children to have fun and laughter, and grow socially as independent, confident and competent learners.</p><p>Teachers have had a variety of opportunities for professional development and learning. They regularly attend meetings with centre managers or teachers from other centres under the same management, and have undertaken leadership training and conferences. The babies‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô teams recently attended a meeting to update their knowledge of best practice for those age groups. Teachers have had external professional training and support in waiata and kapa haka.</p><p>The Hamilton Regional Office of Kidicorp Ltd provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes, and professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing, and teachers respect and value their contributions to the programme. They are involved in sustained, meaningful play and are able to follow their interests and make choices and meaningful decisions about their learning. The independence and self-care skills of all age groups are encouraged. Children are learning in attractive and inviting environments that cater for children‚Äôs interests, offer new experiences, and provide opportunities to research new ideas. They enjoy playing and learning in spacious and natural outdoor environments that stimulate active exploration and develop their physical skills. Children enjoy performing their centre kapa haka, hear te reo MƒÅori used in waiata and everyday phrases, and learn about traditional myths and legends.</p><p>Children up to two have separate indoor and outdoor areas that are safe and offer a variety of interesting activities. They are nurtured by responsive teachers who encourage them to explore and enjoy well-resourced environments. They are well-settled and respond positively to the calm routines and gentle pace they experience during the day. Children transition to the next age-group area when they show confidence and readiness to adjust to changing relationships and expectations. During the process, teachers provide continuing support for children and their parents.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They support and extend children‚Äôs learning and provide skilled positive guidance. Teachers encourage children to solve problems by sharing their knowledge, seeking further information, and working cooperatively with other children. Literacy, mathematics and science are naturally included in the programmes, and children‚Äôs diverse languages and cultures are increasingly evident. Children with additional learning needs are assisted to participate and learn alongside their peers. The centre maintains close relationships with support agencies. Children for whom English is a second language are well-supported.</p><p>Parent and centre partnership is a strength of the service. Teachers value communication with parents. Information about children‚Äôs interests, development and learning are shared formally and informally. Teachers provide resources and information that assist parents to understand the organisation‚Äôs well-rounded approach to children‚Äôs learning in areas such as literacy, numeracy and science. The programmes are based on the <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. They are planned to respond to children‚Äôs interest and promote skills and understandings signalled in the centre philosophy.</p><p>Recent self review has focused on developing a consistent approach to planning and assessment. Teachers are now developing intentional teaching strategies to support and extend the learning possibilities they have identified.</p><p>The use of online portfolios encourages exchanges of information between parents and teachers, so that parents‚Äô aspirations for their children can be responded to in a timely way. Assessments identify children‚Äôs participation and learning, and are beginning to show children‚Äôs progress in developing their learning skills. Six-monthly summary reports and parent interviews provide a platform for parents and teachers to share and discuss this information and develop goals for ongoing development.</p><p>Staff use purposeful, well-structured self-review to improve outcomes for children. Links are made with managements‚Äô centre evaluation checks, appraisals, and areas identified for development in the 2012 ERO report. Recently the centre has focused on assessment, partnership with parents, biculturalism and including family ethnicities. Staff members revisit self-review decisions to evaluate the benefits for the service and make further adjustments as necessary. The centre‚Äôs strategic plan takes account of centre strengths and guides review and development in line with the service vision.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed trusting relationships among staff. They are committed to the service‚Äôs vision and philosophy, and work hard to realise the centre‚Äôs goals. Their practice is well supported by knowledgeable service managers through meetings, visits and professional development. Effective performance management and relevant professional learning and development opportunities guide staff to implement best practice for teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree on the following next steps for development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to develop learning story assessments and consistent programme planning to clearly identify:</p><ul>
<li>specific learning observed in children‚Äôs activities</li>
<li>responsive teaching strategies to support and extend ongoing learning and development</li>
<li>progress in children‚Äôs skills, knowledge, attitudes and dispositions for ongoing learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Rototuna completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4><b>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</b></h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Rototuna will be in</p><p>Dale Bailey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>31 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
