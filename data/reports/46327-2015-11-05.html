</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the first ERO report for Clendon Christian Preschool. The centre, located in Clendon, was established in 2013 in a new and purpose built complex. It provides full and part-time early childhood education and care for up to 80 children, including up to 10 children under two years of age. Staff are multicultural and reflect the culturally diverse community they serve. Staff are able to communicate with children and families in most home languages when needed.</p><p>The centre is part of the Manukau Christian Charitable Trust group of early childhood centres that are located across Auckland. The group provides governance and management support, with the option for centres to make some adjustments to suit their specific contexts.</p><p>The manager for all the centres, including Clendon Christian Preschool, has a clear vision for the centre that is underpinned by Christian beliefs and values. In conjunction with the head teacher for the centre, he has responsibility for management and administration systems, and has developed its policies and procedures. He works collaboratively with staff to review and refine the centre’s systems and processes. The head teacher takes key responsibility for areas relating to children’s learning, teacher and leadership capability, and building partnerships with parents, whānau and the community</p><p>The centre’s philosophy and vision are strongly focused on Christian values and beliefs, and on providing a holistic, high quality service for children and their families. A significant feature of the centre is the high level of commitment that staff have to building meaningful, respectful and caring relationships with children and families. Seven teachers are qualified, with three having full registration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre. They have warm and trusting relationships with adults and a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children enjoy programmes that provide good opportunities for them to access a wide range of play areas. They settle themselves to play and make deliberate choices about resources they need. Children interact well with their peers and show good negotiation skills. They have opportunities to learn te reo and tikanga Māori, Samoan and other Pacific languages. Children are developing good social skills and are encouraged to persevere, problem solve and take on new challenges in their learning.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They interact with children in caring and nurturing ways and skilfully engage children in play that prompts them to collaborate and investigate ideas. Teachers respect and value children's languages, culture and identity. They are committed to recognising the special interests of Māori and Pacific children and ensure the environment reflects the languages and values of these and other cultures. Teachers are reflective and are building their capability through centre wide self review, professional learning, and observations and feedback about their practice.</p><p>Teachers review and improve how they plan learning programmes so that they are more responsive to children’s emerging interests and strengths. They also have an increased awareness of capturing and extending children’s individual interests. This approach enables teachers to plan activities and provide opportunities that are relevant for children. Teachers have started to evaluate learning programmes and are supporting children’s transitions to school. Teachers make children’s learning visible in the environment. They have started to focus more on how children’s learning stories connect to planning and on improving the way that children’s learning development is documented over time.</p><p>A notable strength in the centre is the relationships and partnerships that teachers have with parents, whānau and the community. Teachers provide many opportunities for families to participate in the programme, contribute to reviews and to be aware of their children’s progress. ‘Fun, food and fellowship’ is the mantra that drives this strong community focused commitment. Parents also have input into learning stories, the learning environment and their children’s portfolios. They appreciate the welcoming and inclusive culture in the centre and the quality of education and care provided for their children.</p><p>The learning environment is attractive, inviting and well-resourced and has a wide range of play areas. Teachers and children have started to make plans to transform the outdoor grass area into a stimulating new play area.</p><p>Centre leaders have a collaborative leadership style and work as a cohesive team. All staff are encouraged to contribute to decision making about the centre. Centre leaders access relevant professional learning and development to build teacher capability. They have a strengths-based approach to teacher development and are keen to support teachers to develop their leadership capability.</p><p>The centre vision focuses on the holistic wellbeing and development of the child, the whānau and the community. Comprehensive and thoughtful consultation processes have been undertaken to develop a philosophy that is focused on valuing diversity, caring for people and building meaningful partnerships. Sound governance and management practices are evident. Strategic and annual plans are well developed, well aligned, and identify key priorities for future development. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and leaders agree that next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>developing success indicators for the centre’s strategic goals, in collaboration with parents, whānau, staff and the community, to increase the clarity about what needs to be achieved and so that progress against planned goals can be better measured</li>
<li>continuing to access external expertise to improve the teacher appraisal system</li>
<li>specifying children’s learning outcomes and the teaching strategies that will be used in programme planning</li>
<li>strengthening teachers’ evaluation of learning programmes and the effectiveness of their practice on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clendon Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Clendon Christian Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2  Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
