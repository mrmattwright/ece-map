</table><p>Hardykids Early Learning Service&nbsp;is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hardykids Early Learning Service is located in Nelson and provides all-day education and care for up to 115 children. At the time of this review, 19 M&#257;ori and 3 Pacific children were attending. The centre serves a diverse ethnic community.</p><p>The service was purchased by Provincial Education Group (PEG) in September 2017. PEG provides governance and management support. A management team oversees a number of services nationwide. This includes a regional manager who provides support and guidance to centre staff.</p><p>A shared leadership model was established in June 2018. Day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the centre managers who support the teaching team.</p><p>The centre is purpose-built and caters for children from three months to five years of age, in two separate buildings which are adjacent to each other. Most teachers are qualified. Staffing has been stable and has increased under new ownership.</p><p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the PEG's philosophy and practices. The organisation's values underpinning teaching and learning emphasise whanaungtanga, rangatiratanga, ako, whakamana, kotahitanga, wh&#257;naua tangata and ng&#257; hononga.</p><p>The May 2015 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included self review, bicultural practice and the monitoring of the quality and consistency of assessment documentation. Good progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers changing needs are responded to sensitively and respectfully by consistent caregivers. There are plenty of opportunities for younger learners to refine and develop their physical skills both indoors and out.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging are promoted through the play-based programme. Their independence is encouraged and promoted. They play alongside each other and in groups of their own choosing in sustained ways. Teachers provide resources that encourage exploration that is meaningful and enjoyable.</p><p>Consistent routines establish a framework for the day and provide children with a sense of security in knowing what will happen next. Inclusive practice is promoted and children with additional learning needs are well supported.</p><p>A school readiness programme for older children provides opportunities for them to collaborate on a shared project with peers. This focus draws on children's prior knowledge and values their contributions in what to investigate further. Oral, visual and written literacies are used well through this experience.</p><p>Useful guidance is provided to teachers in the social competence and positive guidance policy. Strengthening teachers' understanding and awareness of their role in the implementation of this policy should lead to improved practice.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are currently engaging in a review of PEG's overarching philosophy. This is supporting them to develop a shared understanding of this key document, and how it reflects <em>Te&nbsp;Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and guides practice. As this review progresses, it should assist teachers to refine the focus on the learning that matters in this context, and more strongly reflect it through their practice and documentation.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is highly valued by PEG which has clear expectations for how teachers will enact their commitment in their practice. Aspects of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori were used by teachers during the ERO review. A next step is for the teaching team to give greater consideration to how well it is promoting educational success for M&#257;ori.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have identified that they plan to further their knowledge of working with Pacific learners through exploring <em>Tapas&#257;: Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners.</em> ERO agrees this focus should support teachers to work with Pacific learners in a more culturally responsive way.</p><p>Group planning is based on children&rsquo;s emerging interests, and extends the curriculum offered. PEG has recently provided guidance for teachers about its expectations for programme planning. This highlights the use of learning outcomes and teachers engaging in ongoing evaluation. If implemented well this should enhance the planning process further.</p><p>Regular portfolio entries record children&rsquo;s engagement in the curriculum and developing friendships. Yearly summary sheets provide useful information to parents about how their child has progressed against the strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Monitoring of the quality of assessment occurs at centre leadership level and useful feedback is provided to staff. An increased focus has recently been placed on involving parents in their child&rsquo;s planning which, when fully implemented should support the developing learning partnerships. Next steps for strengthening assessment for learning should include teachers showing how:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children&rsquo;s cultures, languages and identities are acknowledged and responded to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>challenge and complexity is added to children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Internal evaluation practice is well established and leads to ongoing improvements. Continuing to make better use of the identified indicators to inform the evaluation process should better support teachers to judge the effectiveness of practice. Greater consideration should also be given to what actions are expected of teachers as a result of the evaluation findings, which focus on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Regular parent surveys provide useful feedback for the team. Leaders and teachers have been responsive to this feedback and parents are well informed about the planned response.</p><p>All teachers have participated in a comprehensive annual appraisal. A new process has been introduced in 2019. As part of this approach, consideration should be given to teachers identifying clear and measurable goals and receiving targeted observations and feedback linked to these.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children.</p><p>Collaborative leadership is evident and succession planning is well considered.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for ongoing improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' understanding and awareness of their role in the implementation of the social competence and positive guidance policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give greater consideration to promoting educational success for M&#257;ori and working with Pacific learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hardykids Early Learning Service completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>7 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <i>ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
