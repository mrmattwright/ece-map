</table><p class="title sixteen columns clearfix" id="page-title">Rockmybaby Q3¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rockmybaby Q3 is an all-day, home-based education and care service operating in Hawke's Bay. This is a quality funded network licensed for 50 children, including 25 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review there are 34 children on the roll and four identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>This privately owned service was established in 2017 and is one of six networks under the same ownership operating throughout the North Island. Three of the networks are in Hawke's Bay.</p><p>A visiting teacher supports educators to deliver <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. When required, she is assisted by visiting teachers from other local Rockmybaby networks. All visiting teachers are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises the importance of respectful relationships and lifelong learning.</p><p>This is the first ERO evaluation of Rockmybaby Q3.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The values expressed in the philosophy underpin visiting teachers' practice. The importance of positive relationships, learning through play and children developing a sense of belonging are evident.</p><p>Children have opportunities to participate in a programme based on their interests. Individual learning journals are an attractive record of their engagement in activities and experiences. Leaders recognise that supporting visiting teachers to strengthen evaluation of children's learning is a key next step. This will enable them to more effectively assist educators to identify and plan for the significant learning occurring for children.</p><p>Many children in the service are infants and toddlers and thoughtful placement with educators responds to the needs of them and their families. A wide range of successful communication strategies promotes consistency of children's care.</p><p>Teamwork is well established and strongly evident across the organisation. ERO saw examples of educators and parents working together to support children when transitioning into the service and on to kindergarten and school. Emergent leadership among visiting teachers, educators and parents is encouraged and supported.</p><p>There is a commitment to developing a bicultural curriculum within a home-based context. Visiting teachers continue to support educators to better reflect te ao MƒÅori in their learning programmes. Documentation shows some educators are strengthening their use of kupu MƒÅori, waiata and karakia with children.</p><p>Examples of MƒÅori children's culture, language and identity are reflected in their learning documentation. Strengthening emerging partnerships with local iwi should assist service leaders and educators to continue to support educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>Visiting teachers, educators and families are kept well informed of the regular professional development opportunities provided and are supported to participate. Promoting lifelong learning is a highly evident across the organisation.</p><p>Improving the appraisal process has been ongoing and remains a focus for the service. Continuing to strengthen teachers' appraisal goals is a key next step. This should include the use of measurable indicators, clearly aligned to outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers and leaders regularly inquire into their practice to support on-going improvement. They work collaboratively with staff in other Rockmybaby networks to continue to strengthen internal evaluation.</p><p>Leaders are quality and improvement-focused and have clearly defined systems and processes established to track operational expectations. Administration systems effectively support educators and visiting teachers in their roles.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director and visiting teachers should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation for individual children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bicultural aspect of the service curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation and the use of appraisal goal-setting to support growth in teacher and educator practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rockmybaby Q3 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rockmybaby Q3 will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>26 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
