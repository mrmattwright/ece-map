</table><p>A to Z Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>A to Z Preschool is a privately co-owned and operated centre in Greymouth. It is purpose built and provides care and education for children between two and five years of age from 9am until 3pm. The centre opened in 2011 and this is the first ERO review.</p><p>The owners are qualified early childhood teachers. They manage the day-to-day operation of the centre and teach full time within the programme. The staffing has remained constant since the centre's opening, with most of the staff being Early Childhood Education trained.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy promotes a nurturing environment where children experience fun, trusting relationships and are supported to be life-long, confident learners. The centre's vision is to strive towards excellence. Many aspects of the philosophy and vision are clearly evident throughout the daily programme.</p><p>The large indoor space and connecting outdoor area reflects aspects of the local environment and children's current interests.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers strongly promote children's sense of belonging and security through genuine caring. They have positive and respectful relationships with children and their families. Staff are highly responsive to the wellbeing of children and their whƒÅnau. They effectively communicate important information to parents about children‚Äôs daily needs and wellbeing.</p><p>Children and teachers have fun as part of the learning programme. There is deliberate planning to provide children with humorous and interesting activities. Children play well together and alongside one another. They have many opportunities for sustained play. There are choices within the programme and children can readily access a range of resources and equipment for learning. Parents and community contribution to the programme is encouraged, is highly evident and is a strong feature of the centre.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of implementing cultural competencies within the curriculum. Some MƒÅori concepts such as aroha, manaakitanga and ako are clearly seen in practices and in the programme. The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that further development of the bicultural curriculum continues to be a focus.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well and regularly share information about children's interests and developing needs and capabilities. They have developed a useful framework to support assessing and planning for individual children's learning.</p><p>The managers lead and have built a cohesive and reflective teaching team. They have a strong commitment to teaching and learning and are improvement focused. The managers proactively seek and make good use of Professional Learning and Development (PLD). They are strongly dedicated to the vision and goals for the centre. Staff communicate effectively and are supportive of each other and the local community.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs future priorities have been clearly identified and planned for. The managers are gathering useful information about aspects of the centre‚Äôs operations. Staff, parents and whƒÅnau have regular opportunities to contribute their ideas and opinions. Staff use and understanding of self review continues to be developed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the managers agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure all teachers consistently identify and document the specific teaching strategies they will use to extend individual and groups of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>review the effectiveness and suitability of the four year old programme</li>
<li>extend the ways parents' aspirations for their children are gathered and regularly revisited</li>
<li>strengthen self review, including better use of evaluative questions and good practice indicators</li>
<li>develop a system to ensure all aspects of the operation of the centre are reviewed over time.</li>
</ul><p>The managers have improved the appraisal process for teachers to better reflect the Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of A to Z Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>21 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>

</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
