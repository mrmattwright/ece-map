</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Takarunga Playcentre, in Devonport, is a well established centre that runs as a parent cooperative. Centre practices are based on playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre is open for five sessions per week and caters for children from birth to school age. On the day of the review there were just six children attending a special session for four year old children.</p><p>Families of children attending come from many different countries, making this a culturally rich environment. Parents report that the centre offers valued opportunities for children and their families to establish friendships and networks.</p><p>The centre has had a very positive ERO reporting history. Since the 2010 ERO report the centre has continued to operate efficiently and effectively.</p><p>The centre operates as part of the North Shore Playcentre Association. The association is the umbrella organisation for 21 playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The association manages and distributes funding to the centres and provides a training programme for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Takarunga Playcentre is very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from an inclusive environment that helps them to gain confidence when relating with children and adults other than their parents. Infants and toddlers benefit from interacting with older children and multiple adults. A well resourced environment offers a wide range of possibilities for children‚Äôs creative and exploratory learning. Regular use of the adjoining Mt Victoria reserve and excursions in the local Devonport area grow children‚Äôs awareness of their local world.</p><p>Curriculum programmes promote children‚Äôs active participation in learning. They focus on developing children‚Äôs curiosity, problem-solving skills and social competence. A well designed programme offers older children experiences to participate in group learning in preparation for their transition to school. This programme offers more focused, interactive learning connected with the family session programmes.</p><p>Centre members‚Äô commitment to the playcentre philosophy is evident as they work cooperatively in planning and implementing a child-focused programme. Adults‚Äô shared sense of purpose and clear delegation of roles enable sessions to focus on promoting children‚Äôs learning. Continual self review helps to ensure that sessional programmes are connected and responsive to the interests and developmental needs of different age groups.</p><p>Children have opportunity to learn about multiple languages and cultures. Centre members and the association have a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to building both adults‚Äô and children‚Äôs familiarity with te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. A bicultural partnership with MƒÅori whƒÅnau is evident in association operations.</p><p>The centre is very well managed. Parents are encouraged to be involved in centre administration and to contribute to decision-making. Adults support and encourage each other in their parenting and education roles. Systematic and responsive reviewing and planning processes guide the management of the centre. Committee members‚Äô enthusiasm and commitment promotes continuing centre growth and improvement.</p><p>The association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the association. Management team members are committed to and enthusiastic about their involvement in playcentre. They actively foster emergent leadership to help sustain the association and demonstrate the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise. The North Shore Playcentre Association provides effective support to help this centre remain very well placed to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO is confident in centre members‚Äô capability to promote positive outcomes for children‚Äôs learning and development through ongoing self review. ERO recommends members continue to monitor the effectiveness of centre practices and identify future improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Takarunga Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Takarunga Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>7 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
