</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz Matter 2 Us, in central Henderson, is part of the Salvation Army‚Äôs Faith Factory. The Christian philosophy is an important part of the centre‚Äôs approach and programme. The service caters for children from birth to school age and offers full day and sessional care options. The service operates for four and half days a week.</p><p>The service is led by a centre manager. A wider management group comprised of local Salvation Army leaders works alongside the centre manager to support operations, property management and future improvements. The centre is also supported by a new national Salvation Army early childhood consultant.</p><p>Continuity in centre leadership and teaching staff has helped the family friendly centre maintain the positive findings from previous ERO reviews. Useful assessments of children‚Äôs learning and positive, responsive relationships have continued as key features since the last ERO review.</p><p>External professional support has supported the centre manager and head teacher develop a new appraisal system and increase teachers‚Äô understanding and use of self review. Additional professional development is continuing to extend the centre‚Äôs bicultural practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from high quality care that effectively supports their social skills and emotional wellbeing. Positive, respectful relationships between children, teachers and families promote a strong sense of belonging. Teachers are approachable and know children and their families well.</p><p>The environment is welcoming and spacious. Good resourcing ensures children experience a wide range of learning experiences. Ongoing improvements to the outdoor learning environment are planned. Urgency is required to ensure more complex and challenging learning can occur here.</p><p>Teachers respond to the individual care routines of infants and toddlers. The calm and settled environment supports these children. They form close, caring relationships with their teachers. Younger children have opportunities to learn alongside their siblings while being supervised well.</p><p>MƒÅori and Pacific children‚Äôs identity and culture are supported in meaningful ways, through celebrations of cultural events and displays. Teachers are increasing their use of te reo MƒÅori, with several teachers providing very good examples. Children would benefit from teachers expanding their knowledge and use of specific Pacific languages.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and well supported. Through the wider Salvation Army network, families can also access a range of other useful support services. The centre has promoted close links with local schools to assist children‚Äôs readiness and transition to school.</p><p>Centre leaders actively support teachers to reflect on their practice. They also provide good opportunities for teachers to make positive changes to their practice. Professional development is well planned and used to improve teachers‚Äô knowledge and skills.</p><p>The centre continues to be well managed, with effective systems that are regularly reviewed. Centre leaders have developed their understanding and use of self review. The centre is now better positioned to define and document effective teaching practices, connected to their centre philosophy. This would promote more consistent quality educational practices for all age groups.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that to support long-term developments centre leaders could:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategic planning to focus on outcomes for children, with measurable indicators of success, timeframes and key responsibilities</li>
<li>implement the new appraisal system aligned with annual and strategic goals</li>
<li>increase the use of evaluation in reviews to improve educational outcomes for children</li>
<li>promote learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that to strengthen and support children‚Äôs learning, teachers could:</p><ul>
<li>use current educational research with a set of indicators to document a centre approach to high quality care and education for children up to the age of two</li>
<li>find more ways to integrate complex literacy, numeracy and science within the daily programme and evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the transition to school programme</li>
<li>use children‚Äôs learning stories to better connect teachers‚Äô planning and the programme</li>
<li>further document individual children's progress over time</li>
<li>offer more flexible routines for older children that support them to extend their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Matter 2 Us completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the centre leaders agree to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>risk management plans are in place for groups of children using adjacent Salvation Army facilities</li>
<li>performance management policies and procedures are updated to reflect recent changes to legislation.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz Matter 2 Us will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
