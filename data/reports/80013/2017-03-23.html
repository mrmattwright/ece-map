</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Family Ties Educare - Macandrew Bay provides a home-like environment for children's full day education and care. The centre operates in a house with a large outside environment that adjoins the local primary school playground. The centre's inside environment has been recently refurbished with some redevelopment to improve teaching and learning areas. The centre's vision is to develop socially competent children with a 'yearn to learn'.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three privately-owned centres in the Family Ties Educare organisation. The managing director of the organisation is one of the owners/licensees. She is actively involved in some of the day-to-day centre operations. This centre is currently licensed for 26 children, including 10 under two years of age. At the time of this review there were no under twos.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, staffing has been stable with one teacher taking on the role of lead teacher. The ratio of children to teachers is low. The Family Ties Educare management team has recently improved the centre's capacity to respond to the areas identified for development in the last ERO report. A programme advisor was appointed in October 2016. She is supporting leadership and curriculum development across the organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging to the centre and with their teachers. The teaching staff know the children and their interests well. Respectful, inclusive relationships are highly evident between teachers, children and their parents and wider whānau. This can be seen in the warm, welcoming interactions between members of the centre community and teaching team, and in the way children's behaviour is positively managed. Teachers are successfully sharing children's learning with their parents and whānau via digital learning stories. </p><p>Teachers are readily adopting and implementing improved collaborative processes for assessing, planning and evaluating children's learning. It will be important to continue to embed these.</p><p>Strengths of this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers maintaining responsive, reciprocal relationships with children, parents and wider whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the way in which te reo Māori is used by teachers and children as part of the daily programme and the natural integration of te ao Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the significant contribution some parents make to the centre programme and resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>greater involvement and focus on children leading their own learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smooth transitions within the day between centre routines and children's play.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The recently appointed programme advisor is effectively building staff and leadership capability at Family Ties Educare. She and the managing director have identified areas for significant improvement in the planning and assessment of children's learning. Staff have received some high quality internal professional learning and are positively engaged in the ongoing developments. Improvements have been made to strategic planning and some centre operational systems.</p><p>The programme advisor has effectively:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluated and reported on the quality of assessment and planning for children's learning across the organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>worked with the head teachers and teaching teams to improve the quality of assessment, planning and expectations for evaluating children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developed teachers' confidence and ability to understand children's learning and the impact of their teaching practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The managing director and programme advisor have rewritten the strategic plan to usefully reflect the key priorities for centre and organisation improvement. Centre management should find manageable ways to be systematically informed on centre's progress toward meeting relevant annual goals and strategic priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, centre managers and the programme advisor agree that to sustain recent developments the programme advisor and head teachers should continue to work with the teaching teams to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop evaluation of individual children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine the current assessment and planning model, particularly for individual children and explore ways to make children's learning goals known and shared</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' understanding and implementation of self review within the centre and across the organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the sufficiency of outdoor resources and learning opportunities, within and beyond the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The programme advisor and managing director should continue to support current leadership development. This should include clarifying and documenting lead-teacher roles and responsibilities and how the Family Ties Educare philosophy is personalised by/for each centre.</p><p>The managing director must ensure that appraisal is rigorous, robust and meaningful for teachers, as identified in the last ERO report. Annual appraisals of teaching staff have not been completed. The managing director has introduced a new on-line system for teacher appraisal. Staff are in the early stages of working with this model.</p><p>In 2016 the Family Ties Educare organisation has undergone a number of key changes, including in personnel. To best meet their 'good employer' responsibilities, the management should more frequently seek reliable, anonymous feedback about how staff feel about their employment conditions (including roles and responsibilities).</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Family Ties Educare - Macandrew Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ER80013O review of Family Ties Educare - Macandrew Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>23 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
