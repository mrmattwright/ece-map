<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>The Pasifika Homebased ECE Network is a new service, established in June 2012 by Nukutukulea Aoga Niue Inc. The service caters for 32 children, mostly of Niue and other Pacific nations' descent. Fifteen educators, in their own homes, care for children across South, East and West Auckland. Many educators provide care for children who are part of their own extended families.</p><p>Managers are focused on and passionate about supporting Pacific families and increasing the participation of Pacific children in good quality, accessible early childhood education. The service‚Äôs philosophy is to provide learning based on Pacific values, beliefs and practices. The service has an emphasis on enhancing ancestral Pacific languages and promoting cultural traditions, values and beliefs. The service manager and coordinator, who are registered teachers, are responsible for enrolling and supporting homebased educators and for the programmes they provide for children.</p><p>Children are comfortable and settled in home learning environments. They enjoy excursions and playgroup gatherings and are supported to become confident communicators. Children have a strong sense of cultural identity and many are becoming capable multi-lingual communicators.</p><p>Most of the educators are very new to providing education programmes in homebased settings. They are keen to build their skills and understanding, and to provide good quality programmes for children. They are developing their ability to record children‚Äôs learning experiences and to identify children‚Äôs strengths and interests as a way of extending their learning.</p><p>Nukutukulea Aoga Niue Inc also owns an early childhood education centre and is in the process of expanding its homebased care service, which is based in central Auckland. The Nukutukulea board of managers contracts a manager to oversee finances, administration and strategic developments, and to monitor and report on service operations.</p><p>Managers and coordinators have made good progress in developing the first Pacific homebased service. However, they have yet to develop effective systems and practices to support educators. Self review is not yet being used effectively to assure the board that all legal requirements are met and that they are providing the quality of education that they envisage for children. Managers recognise that they should now contract an external adviser with expertise in homebased education to help them develop appropriate and effective practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO intends to return to the service within 12 months to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The services manager promotes the advantages of homebased care and education and is in the process of building educators‚Äô and families‚Äô sense of belonging to the Pacific Homebased ECE community. She is enthusiastic about possibilities for strengthening current practices to improve the availability and quality of educational provision for Pacific children. Professional development is planned to support improved leadership and management practices.</p><p>The coordinators offer a weekly playgroup and aim to visit educators twice each month. They also offer workshops to help educators develop supportive relationships with each other and to begin building their understanding about their role in supporting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The service provides for infants, toddlers and older children up to school age. Their parents are often also involved in the day-to-day learning environments with other members of the extended family.</p><p>As this is its first review of this service, ERO evaluated the quality of governance and management systems and practices as well as the quality of provision for children‚Äôs care and learning programmes.</p><h4>Findings</h4><p>The benefits children gain from the service‚Äôs focus on enhancing their ancestral language and cultural identity are evident in:</p><ul>
<li>the relationships and interactions between coordinators, educators, families, and children</li>
<li>fluent speakers of children‚Äôs home languages sharing their expertise in cultural traditions, crafts and formal protocols</li>
<li>children‚Äôs confidence communicating with adults and engaging with available resources</li>
<li>the warm, nurturing care provided for infants and toddlers, usually in environments with older siblings or relatives, so that modelling by older children is an integral part of the younger children‚Äôs learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p>Other good practices that are developing include:</p><ul>
<li>frequent opportunities used to support children‚Äôs literacy learning, including drawing, experimenting with writing, reading books and building language and communication skills</li>
<li>educators‚Äô records of children‚Äôs learning experiences, including photographs, children‚Äôs comments and learning stories that reflect the values expressed in the service‚Äôs philosophy</li>
<li>very good inclusive practices to support children with special learning needs</li>
<li>the use of excursions, playgroup and family occasions to extend learning opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>Managers value the knowledge that educators bring to their work. As most educators are new to homebased early childhood education, coordinators are taking an unhurried approach to building their knowledge and understanding. Coordinators and educators should improve programmes for children by more consistently recognising and responding to children‚Äôs potential, capabilities, interests and creativity.</p><p>The board of managers has established some effective governance processes and is well informed by regular reports from the contracted Nukutukulea manager and the homebased service manager. However, more robust self review is required to keep the board informed about the quality of provision for children and to help bring about the necessary improvements.</p><h3>Key next steps</h3><p>To better realise its vision of high quality early education for Pacific children, managers and coordinators will need to access professional development support. This advice and support should help the service to establish effective administrative systems, knowledgeable curriculum leadership, and a systematic process for educator induction and training.</p><p>Managers should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review so that it is informed by evidence, includes consultation with coordinators and the community, and contributes to continual improvement</li>
<li>review and refine the service‚Äôs framework of policies and procedures so they provide better guidance for the management and implementation of good quality provision for children.</li>
</ul><p>Steps that would help to improve provision for children‚Äôs learning include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing and implementing more effective systems for supporting and monitoring both coordinators‚Äô and educators‚Äô practices, including robust performance appraisal</li>
<li>establishing and maintaining detailed records for each educator and child enrolled in the service, including evaluation of programmes, and all communications with parents about children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>increasing resources and challenges for children in both indoor and outdoor learning environments</li>
<li>aligning educators‚Äô practices more closely with the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of The Pasifika Homebased ECE Network completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current provision for health and safety, managers and coordinators should improve documentation and practices relating to:</p><ul>
<li>the enrolment of educators and children</li>
<li>health and safety audits, hazard identification and regular safety checks in educators‚Äô homes and the playgroup</li>
<li>risk analysis and management for all excursions, home environments, and the playgroup</li>
<li>appropriate designated assembly areas for evacuation purposes that do not unnecessarily place children at further risk.</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified several areas where the service does not comply with legal requirements or the expectations of the Early Childhood Education Curriculum Framework. To address these, managers and coordinators must ensure that:</p><ol>
<li>children‚Äôs individual programmes are informed by assessment, planning and evaluation and respond to their learning interests and capabilities, and that coordinators‚Äô practices demonstrate an understanding of relevant theories and best practice in early childhood education<em>[Licensing Criteria for Homebased Education and Care Services 2008, C2,4 Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 43(i,iii)]</em></li>
<li>formal opportunities are provided for parents to be involved in decision making about their child‚Äôs learning, and to contribute to the development and review of the service‚Äôs operational documents<em>[Licensing Criteria for Homebased Education and Care Services 2008, C12, GMA3]</em></li>
<li>robust systems are implemented to ensure the safety of children while in the care of the service<em>[Licensing Criteria for Homebased Education and Care Services 2008, HS5,11,14 and Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 46(1a,c; 2)]</em></li>
<li>a planned and systematic process is in place to manage the selection and training of educators and to ensure that suitable human resource management practices are implemented<em>[Licensing Criteria for Homebased Education and Care Services 2008, GMA6]</em></li>
<li>the service meets funding claim requirements when the child is a member of the educator‚Äôs family and is living in the educator‚Äôs home<em>[Early Childhood Education Funding Handbook 2013, 3-B-4, pp24,25].</em></li>
</ol><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO recommends, and managers agree, that the service should seek support from advisers with expertise in homebased care and education to help managers and coordinators to address the areas for improvement identified in this report.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO intends to return to the service within 12 months to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>16 May 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
