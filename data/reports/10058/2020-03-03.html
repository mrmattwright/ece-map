</table><p>Next Generation Infant Care is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Next Generation Infant Care is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 20 children aged under two years. Children access two indoor learning spaces, including a quieter play area for very young children. The centre serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The centre is one of four under the ownership of Next Generation Childcare Company Limited. An experienced management team, including a director of the company, oversee the day-to-day running of the centre. They lead a team of three qualified teachers and one teacher in training.</p><p>The teaching philosophy focuses on the provision of an empowering environment respectful of the aspirations and values of whƒÅnau. Teachers aim to support children to become critical thinkers, to value their own and other cultures, and to have control over their learning. Establishing a sense of community with whƒÅnau, children and teachers is a central focus of the team.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted many aspects of quality teaching and learning practices that have been sustained. Areas for development included communication with families, bicultural practice and access to ongoing professional learning and development. There has been very good progress in these areas.</p><p>The centre is a member of the Te Ara Whetu KƒÅhui Ako | Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is evident in the programme and teaching practices. Children confidently explore their environment and easily access resources that engage them in play and learning. They play alongside each other and respond with kindness to those around them. Children are relaxed and settled.</p><p>Children benefit from having consistency in teaching teams and teachers who provide nurturing, individualised care. Teachers know and understand the communication styles of individual children and skilfully use language to engage them in play and to model interactions with others. Children have developed secure attachments to their caregivers.</p><p>Teachers provide a calm, uncluttered environment and actively support children to explore indoors and outdoors. The spacious, natural outdoor play space provides a good range of physical challenges. Teachers support children's choices, include children in decisions that affect them and work well as a team. Children confidently investigate their surroundings, following their interests and curiosities.</p><p>Teachers and leaders have implemented numerous communication strategies with families. Time is allocated to welcome new families into the centre through meetings with a leader or teacher. Parents contribute to a blog where they can provide feedback regarding the programme and discuss their children's learning. Teachers gather whƒÅnau aspirations and reference these in learning stories supporting learning-based partnerships.</p><p>Leaders identify bicultural practice as a significant area of growth in this centre over the past 12 months. Effective professional learning and ongoing internal evaluation is supporting deeper knowledge and understandings of te reo MƒÅori and MƒÅori values and concepts. Teachers use te reo in their interactions with children and in learning stories. Increasing the visibility of te ao MƒÅori in centre practices and documentation is an ongoing goal.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are continuing to develop and refine a new process of programme planning. As a result of professional learning, new templates have been introduced to simplify the process and to ensure a meaningful programme is planned for each child within the group setting. Teachers record children's learning through well-written learning stories. Portfolios show continuity and developing complexity of children's learning.</p><p>Service leaders have established a culture of continuous improvement. They have implemented a robust process for internal evaluation and successfully engage the whole team in focused professional learning opportunities. This ensures shared understandings across the team and supports the successful implementation of new initiatives that lead to positive outcomes for children. The leadership structure supports all teachers to lead in their area of strength. The service is well managed and led.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance their current high-quality provision for children, centre leaders agree that their key next steps include rationalising and clarifying the centre's strategic goals to establish a clear direction for the future.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Next Generation Infant Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
