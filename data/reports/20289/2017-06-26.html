</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps on Seymour is licensed for 40 children over two years of age. It provides a broad range of education and care options for parents including sessions and full time care. Most children come from the local, multicultural community. About 40 percent of children enrolled are of Māori heritage. Children play as a mixed-age group.</p><p>The centre is part of the national BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres. A manager provides leadership and is supported by a professional services manager (PSM) and a business manager as well as other BestStart management services.</p><p>Most of the teachers are qualified, with one currently undertaking a qualification in early childhood education. There have been a number of staff changes since the 2014 ERO report. The manager has been in her position for six months.</p><p>The philosophy is based on inclusion, responsive relationships and fostering a sense of social competence for individual tamariki. Teachers plan to build and extend each child's learning. The philosophy values Te Tiriti o Waitangi as a founding document and welcomes and celebrates cultural diversity.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted good teamwork between teachers and settled children involved in active play. The report encouraged teachers to improve and clearly document self review. This included a review of the centre philosophy, strategic and annual plans and the ways children's play is extended and challenged through inquiry. Progress has been made in all of these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the BestStart Educare Limited organisation. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's education and care is well supported by teachers who respond positively to them. They settle well and join in active play easily. Parents are welcomed, and are confident to talk about their child with teachers.</p><p>Teachers focus on children's oral language. They read frequently to children, using open questions to prompt children's understanding and use of language. Children talk confidently with peers and teachers.</p><p>Children are very independent and enjoy playing together outdoors. There are many examples of tuakana/teina relationships where older children support younger children in their play.</p><p>The environment is set up thoughtfully to engage children. They have long periods of uninterrupted time to explore and investigate during the day. Teachers promote children's decision-making especially around meal times.</p><p>Teachers have a strong focus on te ao Māori, the Māori world, and the use of te reo me ona tikanga Māori. These aspects are becoming integral to the ways teachers support children's learning. Some children are confident to use te reo Māori in conversations with their peers and teachers. Two skilled teachers lead the centre's growing understanding and use of te Reo Māori.</p><p>Teachers provide an environment that is inclusive and supports all children to feel competent and confident. They work with the whānau of children who have English as an additional language. They value and respect the cultures of the families that attend the centre.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to share professional practice. The new centre manager leads the team well, empowers teachers and shares leadership responsibilities. Consistency of good practice across the centre still needs to be improved. The new strategies teachers are exploring are beginning to make a difference to teachers' understanding of their work with children.</p><p>Performance management systems are effective. Professional learning and development is relevant and new learning is incorporated into teacher practice. Ongoing mentoring and coaching is used successfully to build teacher capacity. A new appraisal process encourages teachers to inquire more into the impact of their teaching practice.</p><p>Governance systems guide centre operations effectively. Good systems are in place to ensure that staff follow routines and health and safety checks. The PSM shares regular reports that identify strengths and any improvements needed.</p><p>The BestStart PSM team have focused on improving assessment, planning and evaluation of programmes. They are working with teachers to strengthen their understanding of inquiry-based learning for children. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and managers agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers establishing behavioural expectations and boundaries with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build teachers evaluative capacity, and consistency of practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaders and teachers continuing to strengthen assessment and planning processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps on Seymour completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps on Seymour will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>26 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
