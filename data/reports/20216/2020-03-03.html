</table><p>Barnardos Early Learning Home Based North Shore One is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Home Based North Shore One is owned and administered by Barnardos New Zealand. The service previously operated under the name KidStart Childcare. The network is licensed to cater for up to 50 children from the local culturally diverse community.</p><p>In-home educators provide programmes for up to four children, including a maximum of two under two years of age. They are required to complete either tertiary qualifications or Barnardos in-service training.</p><p>Educators are supported by one registered visiting teacher. The visiting teacher and other service personnel regularly visit educators in the home and support them to provide an educational programme for children as well as monitor health and safety. National Barnardos personnel provide governance and management frameworks to guide all aspects of service operations.</p><p>The organisation's philosophy values bicultural practice and children learning through play. Its vision is to provide strong foundations for a future "where every child shines bright". Programmes for children are underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The 2016 ERO review noted that children were happy and settled in the educators' homes. This continues to be a strength. Areas for development in 2016 included visiting teachers' documentation and educators' practice related to cultural knowledge and curriculum. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven home-based education and care network reviews in the Barnardos Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's pukapuka (portfolios) show that they play and learn in well-resourced homes. Learning stories indicate that children have a strong sense of belonging. Regular excursions and playgroups enrich children's learning. Documentation for infants and toddlers shows that they are well supported through nurturing individualised care.</p><p>Children's learning through play, their developing oral language, and positive relationships with others are well documented. The visiting teacher and educators know children and whƒÅnau well. Children and whƒÅnau often form lasting friendships with educators.</p><p>Educators and the visiting teacher encourage and respond to parents' aspirations for and knowledge of their children. This developing partnership is evident in daily conversations and in online communications. Educators' planning and assessment documents show that some have a good understanding of children‚Äôs interests and preferences.</p><p>The visiting teacher is committed to supporting educators to increase their knowledge and implementation of bicultural practices. Some educators work in culturally responsive ways and use children's diverse home languages.</p><p>The visiting teacher has a good knowledge of the educators in her network and a sound knowledge of theories, practices and trends in early childhood education. She supports educators to provide programmes that prioritise learning through meaningful play. The visiting teacher's records show how educators are attuned to how children express and explore their working theories. Her reports show how educators' knowledge about relevant legislation and curriculum implementation is developed.</p><p>The visiting teacher regularly monitors health and safety in educators' homes. Barnardos supports educators with resources, equipment and training to ensure that curriculum expectations and health and safety requirements are being met in homes.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well established. Strategic and annual plans clearly identify priorities that contribute to the network achieving its goals. A culture of relational trust underpins the organisation's operations. Leaders share a strong commitment to implementing their organisation's vision.</p><p>National and regional leaders are dedicated to building the capability of all staff and educators. Appropriate professional development opportunities are provided. Clear management roles, sound accountability practices, and a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures define expectations for all staff and educators.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and the visiting teacher agree that next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support educators in responding to children's learning and evaluating the effectiveness of their teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen understanding of ways to use internal evaluation for ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the extent to which visiting teacher practices respond to children's diverse cultural backgrounds and home languages.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Home Based North Shore One completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
