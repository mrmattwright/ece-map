</table><p>Eden Campus Early Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eden Campus Early Learning Centre is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 30 children, including up to 25 under two years of age. The centre operates under the governance of the Further Chance Charitable Trust. In the same building, the children's mothers are enrolled in secondary education programmes provided by the Eden Campus Teen Parent Unit. Children attend the service for the time their mothers participate in the programme.</p><p>The centre caters for two age-related groups. Children under one year of age have a dedicated indoor area and teacher. All children often spend time in mixed-age play. Currently the roll is small, and most children attending are up to three years of age.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes care for children in a stimulating, respectful environment. Valued outcomes include providing a learning environment that supports children to be curious and confident risk takers.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report there have been changes in staff. The long-serving head teacher has resigned and a new teacher appointed. The trust has introduced a dual approach to leadership. Two staff members co-lead the service, and have oversight of the day-to-day operations of the centre. Two of the three teachers are qualified.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified next steps for improvement relating to appraisal processes and information communication technologies (ICT). Some good progress has been made to improve appraisal processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed to the centre. Relationships are based on acceptance, sensitivity and manaakitanga. Teachers' interactions with children and families are friendly and respectful. Secure, child-teacher-family relationships promote the development of children's sense of pride. Families are highly valued members of the centre, and feel comfortable to stay and settle their child.</p><p>Teachers engage in one-to-one responsive interactions with children. They respectfully offer infants and toddlers choices, and wait for their responses. Teachers recognise that consistency and continuity are important to establish a foundation for young children's education and care. They maintain a calm, slow pace in which younger children have space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Processes are in place to plan and assess children's learning. Attractive records show children's participation in the programme, and highlight their interests. Teachers are considering how they might better plan and document children's individual learning and milestones. This could provide teachers with an opportunity to focus on intentional teaching practices that support children's progress over time.</p><p>A responsive curriculum is fostered and supports children to be proud of their culture. Learning experiences acknowledge and celebrate children‚Äôs heritages and languages. Tikanga MƒÅori routines and practices are promoted, and clearly reflect the bicultural foundation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers seek and value parent/whƒÅnau contributions to planning and learning experiences. Teachers work collaboratively and responsively to achieve parent/whƒÅnau priorities and aspirations. They could now build on these learning partnerships by increasing parents' role in their child's learning.</p><p>Teachers participate regularly in relevant professional learning and development to improve their practice. This has had a positive impact on improving aspects of governance and management. The new appraisal system supports teachers to inquire into the effectiveness of their own practice.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by a comprehensive policy framework, and there is a regular cycle of policy review. It is now timely that the new teaching team establish shared expectations and understandings of internal evaluation. This could support the team to review the centre's philosophy, long-term plans, and inform the future direction to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making planning more visible for children and families, and documenting individual learning and development over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening learning partnerships with mothers and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and updating the centre vision, mission, philosophy and strategic plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eden Campus Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>11 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
