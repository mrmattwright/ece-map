</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Churton Park Little School &amp; Nursery is a privately owned centre located in Churton Park, Wellington. It is one of three services under the Little School umbrella management and provides education and care for up to 40 children. The licence allows for twelve infants aged up to two years of age to attend. At the time of ERO‚Äôs visit the roll was not full and the ratio of adults to children was favourable for the youngest children.</p><p>The service‚Äôs management team comprises the owner-manager and two mentor teachers. The owner-manager has a clear vision for the service and is responsible for setting overall strategic and policy direction. Mentor teachers monitor the quality of teaching and learning and support teachers‚Äô ongoing professional learning and growth. Recently an acting supervisor has been appointed and there have been several changes of teachers.</p><p>The January 2012 ERO report identified a number of areas for development and review. Management sought professional development with an external facilitator to develop understanding of review for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>During times of a child-initiated, play-based curriculum children are engaged and motivated by spontaneous and planned experiences. Their mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use mathematics in everyday life. This learning programme, aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, is relevant and responsive to children‚Äôs interests and adult-initiated ideas. Integrating some of these approaches into the more structured group times should further enhance children's learning.</p><p>Young children‚Äôs independence and self-help skills are successfully supported. Teachers know children well. Children are generally encouraged to talk, listen and question during interactions with teachers and peers. Flexible routines, including at snack times, meet children‚Äôs needs and encourage self-management.</p><p>Children aged up to two years experience warm interactions. Infants are responsive to nurturing adults. Teachers should always be mindful that the importance of play as a vehicle for learning is respected and valued for this small group of children.</p><p>Teachers focus on developing close partnerships between homes and the centre. They work collaboratively to establish a welcoming and inclusive environment in which children are valued and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Children with diverse needs are supported and included. Teachers are welcoming to all children and their parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children‚Äôs participation and involvement in the programme is increasingly celebrated and shared between teachers and parents. The introduction of e-Portfolios, since the previous ERO review, has the potential to contribute to the strengthening of assessment and planning processes. Service mentors have identified that continued support and guidance is required to build teachers' capability in assessment.</p><p>ERO observed some use of te reo MƒÅori and tikanga practices that children respond to. Teachers have expressed that the bicultural programme, and building on and giving significance to MƒÅori learners‚Äô culture, language and identity, are areas to strengthen. ERO agrees with this direction. A next step for teachers is to make use of <em>Ka</em> <em>Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2-13-2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori learners</em> to strengthen responsiveness to MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and focus on maintaining a safe emotional and physical learning environment. A newly introduced online appraisal process encourages teacher reflection and informs professional learning opportunities for staff. Self review continues to be an area to strengthen. The owner, mentors and teachers need to distinguish between reviewing for accountability and evaluating for improvement. Developing robust ways of knowing the impact of teaching practices on children‚Äôs learning and development should lead to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, mentors and teachers should continue to improve and develop their understanding of and practices in:</p><ul>
<li>self review, to more clearly show the impact of teachers‚Äô practices on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>appraisal processes, that promote professional accountability and consistent, formal critique of teaching practice and feedback to improve teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Churton Park Little School &amp; Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Churton Park Little School &amp; Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>1 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
