</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p><em>He whƒÅnau k≈çtahi tƒÅtou, ƒÅ ahakoa he iti he pounamu We are one family, where each member is precious and valued</em></p><p>The guiding principles of this service's philosophy are based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These include:</p><ul>
<li>ngƒÅ hononga - building strong relationships with tamariki parents and whƒÅnau</li>
<li>whakamana - nurturing each child's own educational journey</li>
<li>kotahitanga - opportunities for children to explore and socialise</li>
<li>whanaungatanga - celebrating children's culture heritage and identity.</li>
</ul><p>Gingerbread Cottage network provides home-based education and care for children from birth to school age in Hamilton and surrounding areas. Children are placed in family homes with one educator, who can be responsible for up to four children at any one time. Gingerbread Cottage is licenced to cater for 80 children. Its roll of 39, includes seven children of MƒÅori descent and three Samoan children. The network offers flexible hours to meet individual family, whƒÅnau and aiga needs.</p><p>Gingerbread Cottage is one of two networks owned and operated by a private home-based care service, Gingerbread Cottage Ltd. One of the service's directors is the licensee for both networks. She has overall responsibility for compliance, financial management and administration. The service has recently employed a teacher manager to improve the quality of self review, professional leadership and support for the visiting teacher and educators in each network. The teacher manager and visiting teachers are fully qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The visiting teacher guides and supports educators to meet health and safety requirements and provide an appropriate standard of education and care. She regularly visits children in their educators' homes. As Gingerbread Cottage is a standard network, its educators have yet to complete formal early childhood training. The service encourages them to attend workshops and undertake training to support them in their educator role.</p><p>The April 2012 ERO report for Gingerbread Cottage network identified several priorities for development including quality assurance, appraisal and self review of educators. The new teacher manager has recently begun to address these priorities. Since the 2012 report the service has also purchased and renovated a large warehouse to provide a permanent base for administration, the playgroup and meetings.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki experience a wide variety of learning experiences in educators' homes, parks, libraries, music and playgroups, and natural settings. They have many opportunities to work with and alongside children of diverse ages and abilities, and to form trusting relationships with adults in family-like environments.</p><p>Educators make good use of annotated photographs in individual learning journals to document babies' and toddlers' physical development, emerging language, friendships and social skills. Journals of older children reflect their love of art, music, dancing, imaginative play, development of more complex language and ideas, and exploration of mathematical and science concepts. The visiting teacher frequently contributes learning stories about outings and playgroup experiences.</p><p>Where possible, the visiting teacher places MƒÅori and Samoan children with educators of the same language and culture. Samoan educators strongly support their children's language, culture and identity, with active encouragement and resourcing from the visiting teacher. As a result of visiting teachers attending courses in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, children and educators are becoming more confident to use MƒÅori phrases and observe aspects of tikanga.</p><p>The visiting teacher assists educators to improve the quality of learning outcomes for children by encouraging and supporting them to:</p><ul>
<li>identify and respond to children's learning and interests</li>
<li>provide more diverse learning opportunities</li>
<li>foster child-initiated play, independent exploration and problem solving</li>
<li>make the most of opportunities to foster development of oral language, and where appropriate, to access and implement the advice of specialists.</li>
</ul><p>She also uses the service's playgroup to model effective ways to support literacy learning, set up areas of play, and to interact with children.</p><p>The visiting teacher communicates regularly with parents/whƒÅnau through educators, email, by telephone and occasionally at playgroup. The service provides parents and whƒÅnau with both formal and informal opportunities to contribute to the development and review of the service's operations. This was particularly evident in the recent review of the service philosophy. The service is developing effective systems to support operations and professional practice.</p><p>A notable feature of the service is the high level of collaboration and communication between visiting teachers, educators and parents. The licensee, teacher manager, visiting teachers and educators have worked cooperatively to develop a set of indicators to evaluate their practice, identify gaps, and to evaluate the effectiveness of plans to address these.</p><p>The directors, teacher manager and visiting teachers meet regularly to share information about what is happening within each network. They have recently developed a philosophy, vision and mission statement to guide the direction of the service. These documents clearly specify the service's aims and intentions, which should assist leaders to focus reviews of current practices and new initiatives on improving learning outcomes for children.</p><p>A comprehensive framework of policies and procedures supports service personnel to meet health and safety requirements. Processes for reviewing policies and procedures are well developed and inclusive.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service has a well-developed process to review policies and procedures. The appraisal of visiting teachers is aligned to the practising teacher criteria and regularly monitored during the year. Service managers and teachers acknowledge that the following is an important priority to consider for ongoing review and development:</p><ul>
<li>Strengthening the ways in which visiting teachers and educators plan, monitor and evaluate children‚Äôs learning over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gingerbread Cottage completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gingerbread Cottage will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
