</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Richmond Playcentre is in the process of fully transitioning into being part of the new Top of the South Region of Playcentre Aotearoa. The playcentre is a long-established parent co-operative and is one of 13 in the Nelson-Tasman region. It provides three morning sessions a week for up to 30 children aged from 0 to 6 years and two sessions specifically for infants and their parents. It is situated next to the local school and other early childhood services.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and playcentre operations. The sessions are facilitated by paid kaiako who hold playcentre and early childhood qualifications, and parents who are gaining playcentre qualifications. The new region has employed a Centre Support Worker (CSW) and a Centre Administrator (CA) to support whƒÅnau and kaiako.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 review most parents are new to the playcentre. However, they have made good progress in addressing the recommendations in the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Richmond Playcentre has a welcoming family-like atmosphere where children and whƒÅnau have a strong sense of belonging. Since ERO's 2015 review there has been significant roll growth and many parents are participating in the Adult Education programme to gain playcentre qualifications. Parents' greater appreciation for the philosophy and learning opportunities provided at the playcentre has resulted in a number of parents choosing to keep their children at the playcentre until starting school.</p><p>Key aspects of the playcentre that are promoting positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>well-organised and resourced learning environments that provide choice and challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents actively participating and sharing their strengths and skills to extend and stimulate children's interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ways that kaiako and parents skilfully extend children's learning through open-ended conversations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a child-led programme where children are actively encouraged to take risks, make choices, explore and be creative and expressive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an environment where everyone is seen as a learner with children and adults learning alongside one another.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing relationships they have with their parents and other adults in the playcentre. Older children are encouraged to take on tuakana-teina roles with younger children. Infants and toddlers have full access to the whole programme, although there is a safe play area with age-appropriate resources as and when required.</p><p>The kaiako and parent group work well together to ensure the smooth running of the playcentre. For example, a clear strategic plan has been collaboratively developed to guide the direction of the playcentre. As a group, kaiako and parents are growing in confidence and making good use of some individual expertise to strengthen te reo MƒÅori and te ao MƒÅori perspectives in the programme. This work should be continued. Kaiako and parents seek external support and guidance where necessary, including support from Playcentre Aotearoa, to help children who require additional support in their learning.</p><p>Parents are developing skills and confidence in using self-review practices to know what is working well, what is improving and what needs to be done differently. Parents have identified that the impacts of improvements arising from self-reviews should be monitored over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are for parents and kaiako to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>find ways to ensure all parents are actively involved in planning for their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy to align with Te WhƒÅriki (2017), the early childhood curriculum, and clearly state the playcentre's priorities for children's learning (valued outcomes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that strategic actions relate to outcomes for children and evaluate these to show how well these have contributed to improving outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Richmond Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Richmond Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>16 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
