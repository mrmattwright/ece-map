</table><p>Tippytoes Childcare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tippytoes Childcare is a well-established service in Pakuranga. It is licensed for 40 children, including a maximum of 20 under two years of age. Children learn in three separate age-group rooms.</p><p>There are 18 staff employed by the service, 10 of whom are registered teachers. The majority of staff are long serving. A manager oversees centre operations and administration. The recently appointed curriculum manager supports and mentors teachers with professional practice and documentation. She is supported by supervisors who oversee the daily programme in each room.</p><p>A whole-centre philosophy guides governance and management. Each room has a philosophy statement that distinguishes beliefs and practices for the three age groups. The aspirations of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, guide programmes.</p><p>Managers and staff have maintained the strengths and addressed areas for development identified in the 2014 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers promote a curriculum that is strengths based. They value play as a way of learning and encourage children to lead their own learning. As a result, children are engaged and creative, and confidently try out new experiences. Managers' deliberate decision to have small numbers of children in each of the three rooms has contributed to the good quality learning experiences for children.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging and know adults are there to support them. They engage in activities and projects for sustained periods. Children have access to good quality resources, and competently explore the environment to support and extend their play. One of the key features of the service is the flexible and adaptable programme that supports equitable opportunities for children with additional learning and developmental needs.</p><p>MƒÅori children experience stories from their culture, and teachers use te reo MƒÅori during programme. MƒÅori symbols and art are evident in the environment. Teachers are using resources to help them increase their use of te reo MƒÅori during group times. A group of teachers have taken the leadership role in strengthening bicultural practices. More consistently including te reo in spontaneous interactions and developing a long-term goal to reflect this centre-wide focus, are appropriate next steps.</p><p>There is good support for children's oral language development. Displays at children's level that show learning stories and depict centre events enable children to revisit and have conversations about their experiences. Children for whom English is an additional language can hear their heritage language spoken by teachers. This supports their cultural identity.</p><p>Children up to the age of three years have an individualised curriculum that is flexible and influenced by temperament, health, and routines. This is further supported by teachers with specialised knowledge and practice knowing children well and working in close partnership with whƒÅnau. Children have many opportunities for learning, and are secure in the knowledge that there is a familiar adult nearby.</p><p>Teachers are collaborative and collegial. They seek parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning during conversations, and this contributes to positive relationships with whƒÅnau. The online communication portal has also successfully strengthened communications, and enables teachers to share information about children's engagement in the programme. Leaders agree that documenting parents' aspirations would enhance children's learning records.</p><p>Teachers' professional development has helped them to strengthen learning support for children and partnerships with families. Improved practices have benefitted children from diverse cultures, and those with additional learning needs.</p><p>Managers are improvement focused and provide effective leadership. They work collaboratively with teachers to promote shared team approaches. A new staff appraisal process provides opportunities for teachers to reflect on and develop their practices. Managers now need to implement and embed this appraisal process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for managers and teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen programme planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing specific goals for increasing the integration of bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining strategic goals and associated annual planning, to support ongoing improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing teacher appraisal processes that align with Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tippytoes Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>8 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
