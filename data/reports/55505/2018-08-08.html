</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Nelson/Marlborough/West Coast S2 is a home-based education and care network operating under the PORSE In-Home Childcare Network (NZ) Ltd. It is one of two PORSE networks currently active in the region. Of the 115 children enrolled, 13 are MƒÅori and four are Pacific.</p><p>This network offers two options for education and care: the home educator model where the educator works in their own home; and the nanny educator model, where an educator works in a family's home.</p><p>At the time of the March 2011 ERO report, the service was known as PORSE In-home Childcare Nelson S1. Since then, Evolve Education Group Limited (EEG), has taken over ownership of PORSE, adopting existing structures for national and community team management.</p><p>The PORSE senior leadership team, which is responsible for operation, reports to the EEG board of directors. In this network, three programme tutors who are qualified and registered teachers, work alongside educators and nannies to assist them to implement suitable care and learning programmes for children in homes. Their practice is supported by regional and local coaches.</p><p>The PORSE vision is, 'expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home'.</p><p>This review is one of two home-based network reviews of PORSE In-Home Childcare Network (NZ) Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy continued opportunities to participate in a wide range of learning experiences in educators' homes and the local community. Many attend PORSE-organised playschools, physical activity sessions and excursions. These provide interesting challenges and opportunities to socialise with peers. Programme tutors are aware of local resources to support children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Leaders and programme tutors articulate commitment to practice and operation that acknowledges the intent of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The implementation of a bicultural perspective in children's programmes is supported through access to on-line information and other resources. The programme tutors should continue to seek connections in the local MƒÅori community, and Ministry of Education resources, to inform their approach. The development of a more strategic and sustainable approach, strongly led at governance level, is a priority.</p><p>Relationships among the programme tutors, families and educators are supportive and well established. Building learning partnerships with families and whƒÅnau has continued to be a development priority, strongly promoted by PORSE. Comprehensive information is regularly shared about PORSE operation. Programme tutors provide informative monthly reports about children's learning, wellbeing and interests. Families' input is sought and valued. The use of on-line systems for two-way sharing of information is strengthening how families contribute to this.</p><p>Children's transitions into and out of the network are carefully considered and undertaken in collaboration with families. The programme tutors should continue to develop relationships with school personnel, and their understanding of best practice, to strengthen support for families making the transition to primary school. A strategic review of the PORSE transition-to-school process is underway.</p><p>Programme tutors' regular visits and communication with educators give suitable attention to ensuring PORSE expectations, health and safety requirements are noted, educator practice is acknowledged and ongoing guidance is provided. Feedback from programme tutors, in relation to educators' development priorities, is evident.</p><p>Educators are purposefully supported by programme tutors to develop suitable learning experiences in response to children's emerging interests. Many educators link children's learning to the strands, learning outcomes and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Some develop plans to extend children's learning and receive parent input. Programme tutors should continue to strengthen the focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identifying and recording children's significant interests and learning, and strategies and resources to extend these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflecting children's cultures, languages and identities in learning records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting educators' understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (2017)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring children have ongoing opportunities to reflect on and revisit their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As a first step towards supporting programme tutors to work with their communities to clarify local learning priorities, PORSE should prioritise the review of the philosophy that guides teaching and learning.</p><p>The programme tutors in this region work collegially, supporting each other in their roles. PORSE provides good face-to-face support for their practice. There are regular opportunities for collaborative discussion with other programme tutors, coaching and professional learning and development. Programme tutors have an inclusive approach and are proactive in seeking ways to support educators to participate in professional learning opportunities and PORSE events, and express their point of view.</p><p>PORSE provides good support for leadership and through focused professional development and forums for sharing practice. In their specifically defined roles, coaches provide effective assistance for programme tutors' practice.</p><p>The appraisal process provides opportunities for programme tutors to reflect on their practice and receive constructive feedback from regional coaches. A new process has been developed in 2018 in line with the Education Council revised requirements. Consideration should also be given to developing inquiry-based practice linked to children's outcomes and guidelines to support the new process.</p><p>A well-organised governance and management framework supports operation and practice. There are clear reporting lines and an appropriate focus on quality assurance. PORSE has developed a comprehensive range of up-to-date guidelines that enable programme tutors and educators to successfully undertake their roles. Curriculum guidelines, particularly in relation to planning for learning, and working with infants and toddlers, require updating. Further development is planned for later in 2018. The recent appointment of a curriculum and quality assurance coach should support this work.</p><p>PORSE values self review as a tool to promote improvement. Parents' and educators' views are regularly sought as part of the process. Suitable frameworks have been developed for strategic and spontaneous review, and learning opportunities provided to strengthen the programme tutors' practice. Regular reviews are undertaken that lead to improvement. Further work is needed to support the successful use of the framework at all levels to inform decision making about ongoing developments.</p><p>The PORSE organisation continues to undergo significant change. There is a continued focus on developing operation and practices to support a sustainable future.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The national coach and ERO agree the priorities for this network are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At governance and management level priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update teaching and learning guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use success indicators identified in the strategic intent to measure progress in relation to child outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the revised appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Nelson/Marlborough/West Coast S2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PORSE Nelson/Marlborough/West Coast S2 will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>8 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
