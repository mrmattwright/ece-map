<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with its National Support Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors work with parents, nanny and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p><p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care&rdquo;. Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care. Parents are kept well informed of their children&rsquo;s development and PORSE activities to enhance and strengthen interactions and relationships.</p><p>PORSE Nelson (55505) provides a service for children and families in the Nelson region.</p><p>Parents and families contribute to daily programmes provided by educators. Programme tutors visit educators monthly and provide feedback and support, as well as carry out health and safety checks. Children&rsquo;s development and their involvement in the PORSE programme, including excursions, are well documented.</p><p>The care and education of children takes place within home settings. Those in the sample visited by ERO confirmed that children have access to environments that provide opportunities for exploration, challenge and creative expression.</p><p>The child-based programme offers a wide range of experiences. Children are seen as confident and competent learners. Programme tutors and educators strengthen learning opportunities by providing additional playschool sessions to build on children&rsquo;s interests and previous experiences. There is a noticeable focus on children&rsquo;s development and links are made to Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Educators are warm, responsive and respectful of children. Programme tutors value and foster relationships between educators and seek their feedback to inform the programme. Educators trust children&rsquo;s choices and opportunities for leadership are fostered.</p><p>A good range of activities and materials, including the use of community resources, is available to children. All reasonable steps are taken to make home environments safe. Designated areas inside and outdoors enable children to explore and participate in varied learning experiences.</p><p>Educator professional development is well supported. Visit notes for families identify children&rsquo;s interests, developing skills and educator training.</p><p>Some aspects of self review are used well to inform improvements in the programme. However, there is a need to strengthen self-review processes of educators&rsquo; practice and to ensure compliance requirements are regularly monitored and met.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of PORSE Nelson S1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE Nelson S1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Nelson S1.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The PORSE Nelson network was established in October 2008. This is the first ERO report. The service offers a range of in-home early childhood options for children. Some families choose to employ a nanny who works in the children&rsquo;s home, others choose to place their children with a home educator in the educators&rsquo; homes. PORSE has extensive systems and strategies to monitor and manage the quality of education and care provided for children. Programme tutors, guided by the area coach, visit children regularly and provide written notes to parents about the visit. They work alongside educators to ensure that children receive an acceptable standard of education and care. There is a high level of educator training.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>The child-based programme provides a wide range of experiences and is responsive to children&rsquo;s learning needs and interests. There is a noticeable focus on children&rsquo;s development and sound links are often made to Te Wh&#257;riki. Children are viewed as confident and competent learners.</p><p>Programme tutors and educators strengthen the programme by providing additional playschool sessions. Programme tutor visit notes for families identify children&rsquo;s interests, developing skills and educator training.</p><p>Educators are warm, responsive and respectful of children. Programme tutors value and foster relationships between educators and seek their feedback to inform the programme. Educators trust children&rsquo;s choices and opportunities for leadership are fostered.</p><p>A good range of materials and activities, including the use of community resources, is available to children. All reasonable steps are taken to make home environments safe. Designated areas inside and outdoors enable children to explore and participate in a variety of learning experiences.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Aspects of self review are used well to inform improvements in the programme. However, there is a need to strengthen self-review processes to inform improvements in educators&rsquo; practice and to ensure compliance requirements are regularly monitored and met.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topics" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topics</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Promoting Children&rsquo;s Social and Emotional Competence</h3><p>As children learn to make sense of their world they develop an understanding of themselves in social contexts, including the early childhood service. As part of this review ERO looked at how each service&rsquo;s curriculum supports children&rsquo;s developing social and emotional competence.</p><p>The findings are reported in the Quality of Education section of this report and used as part of a national evaluation report on this topic.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE Nelson S1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the service arranger agreed that programme tutors and educators will continue to:</p><ul>
<li>use self review to inform improvements in practice and to ensure health and safety compliance obligations are regularly monitored and met.</li>
</ul><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>16 March 2011</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><p>16 March 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-porse-nelson-s1" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of PORSE Nelson S1</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report onPORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with its National Support Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors work with parents, nanny and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p><p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care&rdquo;. Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care. Parents are kept well informed of their children&rsquo;s development and PORSE activities to enhance and strengthen interactions and relationships.</p><p>PORSE Nelson (55505) provides a service for children and families in the Nelson region.</p><p>Parents and families contribute to daily programmes provided by educators. Programme tutors visit educators monthly and provide feedback and support, as well as carry out health and safety checks. Children&rsquo;s development and their involvement in the PORSE programme, including excursions, are well documented.</p><p>The care and education of children takes place within home settings. Those in the sample visited by ERO confirmed that children have access to environments that provide opportunities for exploration, challenge and creative expression.</p><p>The child-based programme offers a wide range of experiences. Children are seen as confident and competent learners. Programme tutors and educators strengthen learning opportunities by providing additional playschool sessions to build on children&rsquo;s interests and previous experiences. There is a noticeable focus on children&rsquo;s development and links are made to Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Educators are warm, responsive and respectful of children. Programme tutors value and foster relationships between educators and seek their feedback to inform the programme. Educators trust children&rsquo;s choices and opportunities for leadership are fostered.</p><p>A good range of activities and materials, including the use of community resources, is available to children. All reasonable steps are taken to make home environments safe. Designated areas inside and outdoors enable children to explore and participate in varied learning experiences.</p><p>Educator professional development is well supported. Visit notes for families identify children&rsquo;s interests, developing skills and educator training.</p><p>Some aspects of self review are used well to inform improvements in the programme. However, there is a need to strengthen self-review processes of educators&rsquo; practice and to ensure compliance requirements are regularly monitored and met.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
