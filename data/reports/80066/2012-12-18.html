<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Little Hands Playcentre, Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education (SPACE) programme is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>This review was of the SPACE programme that operates at Little Hands Playcentre. There are two separate SPACE programmes run each week.</p><p>The programme and resources have been developed by the SPACE NZ Trust. The Otago Playcentre delivers the SPACE programme. The SPACE sessions at Little Hands are facilitated by playcentre educators who have the required playcentre training.</p><p>The SPACE programme is specifically developed to support mainly first-time parents through the first year of their child&rsquo;s development and learning. The regular format for a session includes a welcome and settling time, some music and movement, a thought for the session, a discussion topic, afternoon tea and opportunities for infants to explore and play.</p><p>At the time of this review a weekly playgroup also operated at the centre. The playcentre continues to hold its monthly parent council meetings with a view to reinstating licensed morning sessions in 2013. The Little Hands Playcentre is one of four playcentres in the Oamaru region. These four centres have close and supportive links with each other.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in fifteen early childhood education services within the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A strength of the SPACE programme is that babies and their parents attend and learn together. The programme operates for three or four terms. Over time the parents make strong friendships and provide ongoing support for each other.</p><p>The facilitators are warm and welcoming to babies and their parents. Babies are comfortable and familiar with the environment, facilitators and each other. They experience a range of familiar routines and songs.</p><p>The programme shows the value of learning through play, experimenting with activities and making links between what can be done at home and with other family members. ERO observed facilitators building parents&rsquo; awareness of early mathematics in the home and everyday environments.</p><p>The weekly topics help parents recognise and support early learning. The topics also provide parenting advice and support on matters such as: sleeping, feeding, first aid, going back to work, and the value of men in infants lives.</p><p>The programme is well supported by a comprehensive range of resources, templates, and processes to plan and evaluate each session. The facilitators agree that session evaluations could be better used to inform planning for the next session.</p><p>The Playcentre Association has identified, and ERO agrees, that there is potential to modify and deliver the SPACE programme to better support a greater range of first-time parents, for example, teen parents, Pacific and M&#257;ori parents.</p><p>The Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) provides a comprehensive range of support to this and other playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing an action plan for all centres to be relicensed with the 2008 Regulations</li>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing support for employment processes</li>
<li>targeted support for playcentres requiring additional assistance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>The OPA executive and personnel hold regular meetings with a specific focus on each centre. They discuss best ways to support individual centres. Records from these meetings could be more specific about what support is provided and the difference it has made.</p><p>A strength of the OPA is the ongoing support provided by the centre advisors. The centre advisor effectively supports the parents and educators in developing their understanding of planning and assessment and self review.</p><p>Centre advisors should continue to build their knowledge and understanding of self review. They should use each centre's self review as evidence to assure the governors of the OPA how well the playcentre is promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>OPA personnel need to further develop their understanding of self review and use the findings of self review to assure themselves of the effectiveness of their strategic goals and all aspects of the OPA management and operations.</p><p>The OPA governors have a sound policy framework to support the playcentre.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Hands Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
