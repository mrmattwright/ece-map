</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Reporoa is located in the rural community of Reporoa, and in close proximity to the local primary school and college. The centre caters for children from 2 years to 5 years of age and is licensed for 40 children. The current roll of 59 children includes 22 who are MƒÅori.</p><p>Their statement of philosophy has recently been reviewed and reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum) and makes clear references to relationships being the core of what they do and children leading their own learning. The centre acknowledges and respects the cultures of all children who attend.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review a new head teacher has been appointed along with two new teachers. They are currently involved in implementing a revised appraisal process and building upgrades to enhance the outdoor environment. Teachers have participated in significant professional learning and development. Documented self-reviews have been completed for the sustainability of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, centre routines and teaching practices.</p><p>The centre operates under the management structure of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, trading as Central Kids Kindergartens. Staff are well supported by a professional leader and the head teacher who has attended a leadership programme as part of her induction process.</p><p>Policies and procedures are in place to assist with the provision of a safe physical and emotional learning environment for children and staff.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm and nurturing relationships between teachers, children and their peers are a feature of this kindergarten. Teachers know children and their families well and use intentional strategies to support positive learning outcomes for children. Children are becoming socially competent by learning through play in spacious learning environments that are designed to enable children to have active and quiet spaces to play.</p><p>The centre programme provides opportunities for children to make choices and have accessibility to a wide range of resources for prolonged periods of time. Children are immersed in a mathematics, language-rich environment, and te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices are visible throughout the environment.</p><p>The emergent curriculum notices children's interests, recognises and extends children's learning and provides activities and experiences in relevant contexts. The curriculum is aligned to <em>Te Whariki</em> with a focus on children leading their own learning, and this builds children's identity as successful learners.</p><p>Effective transitions are supported by strong partnerships between families, services and schools. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions into and within the service, and when moving to school.</p><p>A reflective head teacher is building an effective and collaborative teaching team and facilitates professional discussions and readings. She is well supported by a professional leader who has established effective working relationships with the head teacher and teachers.</p><p>Self review continues to evolve within the centre with a mix of spontaneous and long-term reviews that lead to improved outcomes for all children. A newly introduced appraisal process includes teacher inquiry into individual and centre focus areas, and is linked to relevant professional development for all staff. The centre's vision and goals are firmly focused on learning and equitable outcomes for all children.</p><p>Parents spoken to by the ERO team expressed high satisfaction with the approachability of staff and the informal and documented communication that keeps them informed about their child‚Äôs social progress and centre events. ERO and management have identified the need for portfolios to more clearly show children's progress over time and make specific links to prior learning and whƒÅnau aspirations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre management agree that the next key steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to build a collaborative team culture to ensure open communication, shared philosophy and agreed approach to centre practices and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidate and embed the recently reviewed philosophy to increase parent and whƒÅnau understanding of centre practices and routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen te reo MƒÅori spoken naturally within the daily programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Reporoa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Reporoa will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>28 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
