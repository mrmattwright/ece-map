</table><p>Piha Community Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This community-based preschool provides full-day early learning services to families in Auckland's west coast suburb of Piha. The preschool operates four days of the week, sharing its premises each Monday with the local play group, an arrangement that has been in place for many years.</p><p>The preschool is licensed for 27 children, including five under two years of age. The centre is well attended most days. There are currently six MƒÅori, together with 22 PƒÅkehƒÅ children enrolled. Many children have had older siblings and whƒÅnau attending in previous years. Staff include a stable team of qualified teachers supported by an administrative manager.</p><p>A major upgrade and extension of the outdoor area was completed in 2019, in collaboration with the preschool trust board and the local council. The long-standing head teacher is the nominated service provider and reports regularly to parents and community members on the elected trust board.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report commented on children's authentic learning opportunities and noted areas for improvements. The staff have made some progress to address these next steps.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a mixed-age play-based learning programme. They make decisions about their play and select from a wide range of appropriate equipment that supports their learning progress.</p><p>Children are viewed as capable and enthusiastic learners. They engage positively with the teaching staff and each other, developing social competence and oral language skills. The calm and unhurried centre environment helps children to sustain their play and return to activities that interest them.</p><p>Teachers are observant of children's strengths and learning dispositions. They respond to children's interests and make suggestions about how these can be extended. Teachers share their assessments of children's individual learning progress with parents/whƒÅnau through the recently introduced digital and social media platform.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau are made very welcome in the centre. Many stay to settle their children and share information with teachers. Parents who spoke with ERO express appreciation for the many ways teachers communicate about their children's progress and centre events. They are supportive of the preschool's community focus, including the creative arts and outdoor excursions.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed the preschool philosophy and the desired learning outcomes for children. They have also consulted meaningfully about the aspirations of local whƒÅnau MƒÅori. As a result, the programme is now more strongly focused on aspects of biculturalism and environmental sustainability, as well as local contexts.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and set long-term strategic goals to improve outcomes for children. They have also completed comprehensive internal evaluations that have provided opportunities for leadership and increasing evaluation capability. Newly developed annual planning could be better used to show the alignment of goals, evaluation and systematic reporting.</p><p>The learning programme for children reflects several key principles of <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum. There is a strong sense of belonging, family and community. However, there is little documented evidence of teachers' programme planning. It would be useful to account to parents and to the trust board, for how the national curriculum is implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>demonstrating more explicitly how learning programmes for children align to <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updating documentation to better reflect the learning outcomes, dispositions and values aspired to by parents and teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piha Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, the service should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal processes to ensure that teachers are meeting requirements of the Teaching Council for maintaining a Practising Certificate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a documented process for maintaining minimum ratios during staff breaks.</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="[sitetree_link,id=]" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
