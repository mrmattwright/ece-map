</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children at Fiordland Kindergarten benefit from a high-quality education and care programme. Teachers aim to ignite a life-long love of learning and for children to gain the skills of inquiry, questioning and thinking.</p><p>Fiordland Kindergarten is located in Te Anau. It provides three morning sessions and two extended days for up to 30 children.</p><p>A positive feature of this kindergarten is the Nature Discovery programme that is held in a nearby nature reserve. This programme has attracted significant media interest and the interest of other educational organisations.</p><p>The outdoor area reflects the local Te Anau environment and is interesting for children to explore. The indoor area is very well resourced and is thoughtfully arranged for children to play alone or be together</p><p>ERO found the good practices reported in the October 2010 ERO report have been sustained and the teaching team has made the suggested improvements from that report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing is enhanced by the team‚Äôs enthusiasm for teaching and learning. Teachers have responsive and respectful relationships with children and their families. The head teacher has established relationships with families over many years. This contributes to a sense of community ownership of the kindergarten. Parents and whƒÅnau take an active role in their children‚Äôs learning. They are comfortable to stay and play, and learn with their children.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge whakapapa (ancestry) as important to developing children‚Äôs sense of self and their place as part of a wider family and connectedness to the community. This leads to children having a strong sense of their own identity.</p><p>Children are well supported as they transition into kindergarten and later as they move to school. In their time at the kindergarten, teachers help them to become independent, confident, competent learners. ERO observed children with strong friendships. Together they appeared engrossed in imaginary and dramatic play. They choose from a wide-range of stimulating individual and group learning experiences. There is an unhurried pace to the day.</p><p>Teachers provide a programme that is responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities and is well aligned to Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum. Strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the clear intentions teachers have for children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>the way teachers weave elements of MƒÅori world views in and deliberately teach children about these, for example, developing children‚Äôs understanding of papatuanuku and local legends</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô subject knowledge which enables them to support children‚Äôs interests and enquiries</li>
<li>the strong focus on science, nature and sustainability, art, early literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>the way children are supported to access information from a range of sources such as the internet, books, community specialists and family.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from high-quality learning conversations with their teachers. Teachers have a wide range of teaching strategies that support learning and they deliberately foster children‚Äôs oral language. Teachers genuinely listen to children and explore the deeper meanings in their learning. They give children specific feedback and encouragement.</p><p>Teachers have creative and innovative practices. This is evident in the way that the nature discovery programme is integrated into the regular kindergarten programme. Teachers use plants, insects and animals to stimulate children‚Äôs curiosity and excitement, teach them to observe carefully and develop the qualities of empathy and guardianship of the earth.</p><p>Teachers thoughtfully arrange the environment and support children to make decisions about the resources they need to use to achieve their learning goals. Children are empowered to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves, others and the natural environment.</p><p>Teachers have effective assessment and planning systems in place to ensure that all children are catered for. They seek parents‚Äô views and take into account the parents‚Äô wishes for their children when planning group and individual programmes.</p><p>Teachers are able to explain and discuss teaching and learning and apply current theory to their teaching practice. The head teacher provides strong leadership to the team. She and the team share leadership with a focus on learning. They develop collaborative relationships and are clear about what their roles and expectations are.</p><p>Emergent leadership among teachers is encouraged. Teachers use professional learning opportunities to build their own and support other colleagues‚Äô practices.</p><p>Teachers thoughtfully and regularly examine their practices and use good processes of self review to find ways to improve what they do for children.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long-term direction of the association.</p><p>They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>The association is committed to transforming each kindergarten‚Äôs outdoor play area. Children now play and learn in attractive and natural environments.</p><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Fiordland Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>A further enhancement to current very good practice would be for the teachers to refine documentation for strategic planning and then use self review to monitor their progress towards achieving the intentions of the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fiordland Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fiordland Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>14 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
