</table><p>Fiordland Kindergarten is Well Placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fiordland Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children over two years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children who participate in half or full-day sessions from 8.30am to 2.30 pm. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher supported by qualified early childhood teachers and parent help.</p><p>The philosophy states that children will:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>be inspired by the natural world and in particular Tō Mātou Wahi Ahi Kā (our special place)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop strong ecological identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be proud of themselves and where they come from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop strong and trusting relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Fiordland Kindergarten is one of 23 kindergartens administered by Kindergartens South (KS). A general manager oversees the association under the governance of a board. Senior teachers provide ongoing professional advice and guidance to each kindergarten and teaching team.</p><p>Since ERO's 2014 review, a new head teacher and a teacher have been appointed. The teachers have made some progress to meet the recommendations in the 2014 report. The strategic plan goals are closely aligned to the philosophy, teacher appraisal goals and professional development opportunities. Internal evaluation remains an area for further improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in Kindergartens South.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy, settled and engaged in meaningful learning of their choosing. The curriculum design is well linked to the kindergarten's priorities for children's learning. Children's opinions on what they want to learn are regularly sought. Wall displays clearly document the depth and breadth of children's learning and the strong influence of the local environment.</p><p align="justify">Children are knowledgeable about the local history and committed to sustaining and improving the environment. Teachers skillfully incorporate the unique, natural features of Te Anau into the indoor and outdoor areas and planned programmes.</p><p>Children are challenged to problem-solve and reflect deeply on what they know and understand. Teachers use a range of approaches to engage children in learning that interests them. These build their capability to reason and think critically. The programme provides many opportunities for children to participate in science and music experiences and to be imaginative in their play and learning.</p><p>The children are recognised as competent and confident learners by the wider community. Members of the community visit the kindergarten regularly to share their skills and knowledge with the children. They often invite the children to contribute to significant community projects and events. The children have won many local awards.</p><p>The environment is inclusive and welcoming to children and their whānau. Tuakana-teina relationships are clearly evident in the ways older children involve younger children in their play and learning. Parents spend considerable time at the kindergarten, joining in activities, socialising and using their skills to extend children's learning and ideas.</p><p>Children's knowledge, use and understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori is increasing. Teachers have taken some appropriate steps to improve this aspect of the programme. They know this is an area where more work is required.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2017 reviews of kindergartens, there have been significant changes within the association management and leadership team. Many of the good practices in place to support the kindergartens have been sustained. However, ERO found that the board needs better information to know how well kindergartens are improving outcomes for children. The board also needs to review its own performance and review the roles and responsibilities within the association leadership and management team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association and the board have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop the vision, values, philosophy and goals to better reflect the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and te ao Māori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure reporting and monitoring at all levels is evaluative and shows how outcomes for children have been improved, especially for priority learners and in relation to the association’s valued outcomes, vision and philosophy</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure there is a clear process for consulting with all parents and whānau Māori within the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor the effectiveness of new initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the roles and responsibilities of leadership positions within the association and review the performance and effectiveness of the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and update the complaints policy and procedure.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers at the kindergarten have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a more in depth understanding of internal evaluation, and ensure the process is rigorous and focuses on outcomes for children, particularly Māori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve assessment and planning by involving parents and children more in the goal setting and evaluation processes, and clearly identify learning and teaching outcomes in the programme evaluations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and clarify the roles and responsibilities within the teaching team, and ensure workloads are manageable and sustainable.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fiordland Kindergarten completed an <i>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</i>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p><b>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</b></p><p>The next ERO review of Fiordland Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern Southern Region</p><p>31 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 3</span> of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 622px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <i>arotake</i> – self review and of <i>whanaungatanga </i>– partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><i>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</i> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERO’s </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">website</span>.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
