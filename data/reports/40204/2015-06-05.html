</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz World &ndash; Maisey Place is a full day licensed education and care service located in Rotorua. It is licensed to cater for 50 children, including 25 children up to the age of 2 in two age-based areas. At the time of this ERO review there were 15 children who identified as M&#257;ori from a number of iwi.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance and management of Kidz World organisation that has two other centres in Rotorua. The organisation places priority on the provision of high-quality services and positive learning outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the centre manager has remained in her role and two team leaders have been appointed to over see the day-to-day operation of the two age-based areas.</p><p>The centre has sustained its areas of strengths identified in the previous ERO report in 2012 and has responded positively to the areas for development related to the philosophy, assessment practise and appraisal process.</p><p>The centre exceeds minimum Ministry of Education requirements in relation to the number of teachers with recognised qualifications and adult-to-children ratios.</p><p>The service prioritises respectful and nurturing relationships with children and their family/wh&#257;nau. They aim to foster curiosity, exploration, self responsibility and sustainable practices for children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Kidz World belief in a collective responsibility that includes parents &lsquo;to do the best for our children&rsquo; is central to the service&rsquo;s philosophy, strategic plans, policies and expectations for teaching and learning. The senior management team work collaboratively to design and promote effective strategies, which align with, and support the implementation of, key values and principles expressed in the philosophy. This team has been integral in furthering the development of comprehensive and robust systems for self review, teachers&rsquo; appraisal, registration and professional learning and development.</p><p>The director/owner sets clear direction and expectations for the service. She is supportive and actively involved alongside the centre manager, and together they foster developing leadership, and encouraging staff to use and grow their expertise. The centre manager is an experienced and knowledgeable professional leader. She has developed a culture where children are first and foremost, valued and celebrated for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Effective centre leadership is resulting in teachers reflecting on their practice to enable them to respond to what they notice about children&rsquo;s interests and learning.</p><p>The Kidz World - Maisey Place play-based curriculum is well designed and applied to promote positive learning outcomes for children of all ages. Key features of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>respectful relationships, nurture and social competence</li>
<li>literacy, mathematics and science</li>
<li>foundation skills for life-long learning, including healthy eating, self care, life skills and problem solving</li>
<li>sustainable practices like re-purposing materials, where children and teachers create resources and equipment for extending play and exploration</li>
<li>the balance between the natural world and digital technology.</li>
</ul><p>Children experience a rich curriculum where they are actively engaged and enjoy purposeful, authentic, hands-on play and learning. There would be benefit in documenting the curriculum design and priorities to further clarify the thinking that underpins the curriculum and teachers&rsquo; practice.</p><p>Teachers pay careful attention to creating and maintaining vibrant, interesting and complex environments that invite exploration and learning both inside and outdoors. Teachers are developing their understanding about their role to provide experiences that spark children&rsquo;s curiosity and extend their potential as learners. Features of interactions among adults and children are positive and inclusive, and celebrate the uniqueness of each child and family.</p><p>The centre culture is reflected through the calm, settled environment where there is fun and laughter, along with a strong sense of family and belonging.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Ongoing work and development in the following areas should support the implementation of the centre&rsquo;s strategic direction and motto &lsquo;better than before&rsquo;:</p><ul>
<li>full implementation and use of the Mahara information and communication technologies programme as a tool for documenting assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>bicultural development</li>
<li>indicators for teacher practice</li>
<li>growing the role of team leaders within the new management structure.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz World &ndash; Maisey Place completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz World &ndash; Maisey Place will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
