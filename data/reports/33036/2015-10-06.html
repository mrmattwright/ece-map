</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ashurst Park Playcentre is located next to Te Rapa Primary School, which is in Hamilton‚Äôs north-eastern suburbs. It is licensed for 25 children including up to 15 under two years old. At the time of this ERO review, 20 families and 28 children are enrolled at this playcentre, three children identify as MƒÅori, and several are from other non-European backgrounds. There are four sessions per week for 0 to 6 year olds and one session per week for children over three.</p><p>The centre operates as a parent cooperative under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA). The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the WPA continue to provide effective governance and strategic direction for the centre. Members also benefit from the ongoing guidance and support of centre support workers, and adult education courses. This support and training is underpinned by the association‚Äôs philosophy '<em>WhƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi - families growing together'</em>. The association‚Äôs commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident in its bicultural leadership model, support for MƒÅori whƒÅnau, and funding to support members to include te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in learning programmes.</p><p>Members of this playcentre responded positively to the findings of the previous 2012 ERO report. They have reviewed and strengthened planning and assessment processes, and created a designated area for infants and toddlers when needed. There has been a sustained focus on developing and maintaining bicultural practices within the programme, which has been well supported by WPA personnel.</p><p>The playcentre‚Äôs philosophy of parents as first educators enjoying learning and play together is very evident in the programme. All parents are enrolled in playcentre education courses. Children enjoy a cheerful, welcoming home-like atmosphere where they are empowered to be confident, capable learners.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from high quality positive interactions with adults and one another. Adults continually respond to children‚Äôs interests, tune into their ideas, and extend their thinking. They provide interesting exploration activities and use open-ended questions to promote children‚Äôs conversation skills and build vocabulary. Adults take time to listen actively and look for deeper meaning in children‚Äôs thinking and understanding. High adult-to-child ratios facilitate opportunities for rich oral language to occur throughout the programme. Self management and independence are valued and fostered.</p><p>Te reo MƒÅori is increasingly used by all parents. Children understand and respond to simple te reo MƒÅori phrases. Tikanga MƒÅori is well integrated within the culture of the playcentre. Members are reviewing resources to ensure that bicultural perspectives are engaging for children. Te reo MƒÅori is a planned component of session evaluations. The playcentre benefits from strong support from the WPA kawanatanga in their continuing development of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are very well nurtured and respected. Resources in their designated area include sensory and home-play equipment. They are also encouraged to explore within the wider playcentre environment where there are many opportunities for interactions with siblings and older children. Adults respond respectfully to children‚Äôs verbal and non-verbal cues. Older children support young children in their self-initiated play and exploration. Playcentre parents provide strong support for mothers with babies and very young children.</p><p>Parents and children lead and contribute to the centre‚Äôs programme, which is based on children‚Äôs interests and parents‚Äô aspirations. Home interests are continued at playcentre and vice versa. Literacy, numeracy and science concepts are evident in play and learning activities. These are further developed in the older children‚Äôs session. Regular excursions to places of interest provide authentic learning contexts for children. Family cultures are valued and shared.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation have been considerably strengthened as a result of self review, professional development, playcentre course work and peer support. Portfolios demonstrate progression of children‚Äôs learning and development. Members systematically evaluate emerging interests and teaching practice at the end of each session, and use evaluations to guide ongoing planning.</p><p>The playcentre environment effectively promotes and celebrates children‚Äôs learning. The indoor area is print-rich and has accessible real-life resources that encourage sustained engagement. The outdoor area is spacious and well organised to promote physical challenge, construction and social play. Natural resources are available and used.</p><p>Centre leaders demonstrate high levels of trust empowering members to negotiate, solve problems, and reflect critically on the programme. Parents take responsibility for ensuring that the playcentre is well organised and runs smoothly. Members contribute and further develop their skills and expertise. Playcentre course work is actively encouraged and develops both teaching and parenting skills. Self review is ongoing resulting in positive outcomes for children. The CSW provides regular affirmation and feedback to centre members about their practices and compliance with ECE requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps identified by centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>review and further develop processes to support transitions into the playcentre and to school</li>
<li>further develop members‚Äô understanding of assessment to include the identification of learning dispositions, and the use of agreed indicators for describing oral language development.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, at WPA level there is a need to review and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>CSW reports that are linked to licensing criteria and strategic aims of this centre</li>
<li>the appraisal system for paid supervisors that includes a clear job description and specific feedback aligned to expectations for teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ashurst Park Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ashurst Park Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
