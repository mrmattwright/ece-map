</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nurtured at Home is a privately owned company that provides home-based care for children within seven networks across the wider Auckland region. This Auckland service opened in 2014, and has since extended to networks in the Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Hawkes Bay and Gisborne. The owner is a fully qualified early childhood teacher. She provides comprehensive governance and leadership support for the service and works with a training and development manager to provide professional learning for the teaching team. The Nurtured at Home Auckland service employs seven full-time, fully registered teachers and a manager who provides leadership and management support.</p><p>Nurtured at Home serves a culturally diverse community. The majority of children are Tongan, and a small number are Māori. Two of the Auckland networks cater for Chinese communities and are led by a Chinese-speaking teacher. Another network has a growing number of Samoan children and is led by a Samoan-speaking teacher.</p><p>Each visiting teacher supports 12 educators in their network. Teachers visit educators at least two or three times a month. They provide educators with resources, and guide them in the care and education of infants, toddlers and older children. Teachers provide educators with written and oral reviews of their practice.</p><p>Nurtured at Home - Auckland 6 has mostly Tongan and Samoan children and is led by a Samoan-speaking visiting teacher. The network caters for children and families in the South Auckland area. It is licensed for 80 children, including 40 up to the age of two. Currently 61 children are on this network's roll.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for the Nurtured at Home Auckland service.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five home-based network reviews in the Nurtured At Home (Auckland) Limited organisation. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Visiting teachers forge positive and respectful relationships with educators, children, parents and the extended families they serve. Visiting teachers establish trust with educators. They support them to use teaching strategies and approaches that promote positive outcomes for children. These play ideas and activities include the use of natural materials and home-made educational resources.</p><p>Visiting teachers promote connections between educators and children through playgroups and discovery days. These events provide different learning experiences for children and useful educational ideas for educators. These connections prompted a group of Tongan educators to meet as a group in order to enhance the aspirations that Tongan parents have for their children.</p><p>In many cases, educators share the same cultural background as the children in their care. This means that care and educational practices are responsive to the cultures of children and their families. Educators prioritise the use of children's first or home languages. Visiting teachers value and are responsive to the various cultures in each network. They know their educators and children well. Teachers and managers use a variety of successful approaches to maintain connections with parents.</p><p>Visiting teachers have good professional knowledge and understanding of early childhood educational theory and practice. They have useful systems for recording children's learning and progress. Their learning stories highlight the connections between children's play and learning. These stories provide good information for parents and educators about what and how children learn. Some educators notice, recognise and respond well to children's interests and strengths.</p><p>Visiting teachers maintain clear and useful records of their visits to educators. They identify how educators interact with children, and focus on children's health and wellbeing. They engage educators in discussions about children's learning and support them to reflect on and improve their practice. Educators have access to visiting teachers and to the management team.</p><p>The service's philosophy and guiding principles are evident in management and teaching practices. Managers work collaboratively with each other and with the visiting teacher team. They recognise strengths in teachers and educators, and empower others to take on leadership roles. Professional learning for teachers is very well considered and is responsive to the needs of teachers and educators in the home-based care context. They maintain a well-stocked toy library and educational resources. This facility along with equipment such as prams and cots, is available for educators at no cost.</p><p>Managers maintain good systems and processes that promote ongoing improvement and accountability. They keep up-to-date with legislative requirements. Recent restructuring of management team responsibilities has further improved the systems and practices across the organisation. This improvement includes a well-executed and up-to-date policy framework.</p><p>Managers and visiting teachers have a good understanding of self review as a tool for improvement. The teacher appraisal system supports teachers to reflect on and improve their practice. Managers ensure that strategic planning, service goals, appraisal and professional learning are well aligned. They make strategic appointments to meet the cultural diversity of the community they serve.</p><p>Managers express their commitment to bicultural practice and approaches that affirm Māori as tangata whenua. Culturally responsive teaching and learning approaches are included as part of the organisation's professional learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and ERO agree that key next steps for the service include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the evaluative component of self review, including having a longer-term focus on a particular area across the whole organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening bicultural practices at all levels of the service, including a focus on the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nurtured at Home - Auckland 6 completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nurtured at Home - Auckland 6 will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
