</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glen Warren Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens in the Oamaru Kindergarten Association (OKA). It is located on the grounds of Oamaru North School and is licensed for up to 30 children. Children aged from two to six years attend for up to six hours each weekday. Thirty five children attend on different days through the week.</p><p>There have been recent changes in staff, including a new head teacher in Term One 2018. The head teacher is well supported in her role by teachers and teacher aides. Children are provided with a cooked meal four days per week. An external Education Services Manager (ESM) supports professional practice in the team. The OKA oversees the governance and management of the kindergarten.</p><p>Since the August 2014 ERO report, teachers have made good progress on the areas identified for further development. Planning, assessment and evaluation processes require further strengthening.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the OKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The visibility of children's language and culture in the programme, and teachers' culturally responsive practice are key strengths which are promoting positive outcomes for all children. Teachers have established positive and trusting relationships with children and their families. They are very responsive to whānau and family needs. They provide additional targeted support to children and their families to enable all children's active participation in the kindergarten.</p><p>Children play and learn in a rich bicultural programme. Key concepts, such as manakitanga (caring for others) and kaitiakitanga (caring for the environment) are well integrated in the philosophy and are evident in practice. This is supporting all children to know about New Zealand's bicultural heritage, and helps Māori children to be proud in their identity. Pacific children benefit from the way teachers deliberately integrate aspects of their language and culture into the programme.</p><p>Teachers have clearly identified a broad range of curriculum priorities, including:</p><ul>
<li>literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>physicality</li>
<li>science, technology and the arts</li>
<li>tangatawhenuatanga (placed-based learning).</li>
</ul><p>These priorities are reflected in the broad range of experiences and resources provided for children. Teachers know children well, and are responsive to their strengths and interests. They deliberately extend their ideas and support their social development. Children with additional learning needs are well supported by teachers, who work in partnership with external agencies.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers are developing a clear vision for the kindergarten. They have quickly formed a cohesive team and are developing new systems and processes to ensure shared understandings. The head teacher and teachers are trialling new approaches for individual and group planning, assessment and evaluation. They, and the ESM, have identified that these processes need further development and strengthening. Individual records of children's learning could better show how teachers respond to parents' wishes for their children's learning, and how teachers and parents can support this.  When planning for groups, teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>make clearer links to the kindergarten's  curriculum priorities and the intended learning for all children</li>
<li>show the strategies and experiences to support the intended learning</li>
<li>evaluate how well the strategies and experiences have supported the intended learning for all children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use internal evaluation well to make improvements to programmes and practices. They are deepening internal-evaluation practice through professional learning and development. The next step is to continue to embed knowledge and understanding of internal-evaluation processes.</p><p>Glen Warren Kindergarten receives targeted and well-planned professional learning and development. The team is well supported by the ESM to identify what is working well and areas for further development to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The OKA effectively supports the kindergarten. It provides a useful strategic and operational framework for the kindergarten's management. There is strong alignment from the OKA strategic priorities to the kindergarten's priorities and plans. The OKA is committed to equity for all children, providing targeted resources to enable participation and inclusion of all children and their whānau. The OKA board is well informed about how well each kindergarten is progressing and contributing to the strategic direction.</p><p>The OKA strongly supports ongoing improvement across its kindergartens. It has effective evaluation and assurance practices that inform change and development. The OKA also supports its kindergartens to have constructive partnerships with other agencies and providers. Teacher capability across the OKA is being strengthened through an improved appraisal system. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the head teacher and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop and strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes for groups and individuals</li>
<li>embed effective internal-evaluation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glen Warren Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glen Warren Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>24 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
