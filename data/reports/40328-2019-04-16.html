</table><p><span>Creators@Home-Nelson¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creators @ Home-Southland is part of a national service which provides care and education for children from birth-to-school age in the educarer's own home.</p><p>Prior to 2014 the service was known as Footsteps Education Southland. The November 2011 ERO report of the Footsteps service, identified a range of practices requiring further development. Creators Education Trust worked in consultation with the Ministry of Education to meet full licensing conditions for all of its home-based services.</p><p>A national coordinator has oversight of all Creators @ Home early learning services. In the home-based services, regional leaders are responsible for managing the work of the visiting teachers. In this network, one teacher and the regional leader work together to support in-home educarers to provide suitable care and learning programmes for children.</p><p>Three models of support are in place: 'At home', where educarers care for children in private homes; 'Awhi' for caregivers of children under shared guardianship with Oranga Tamariki; and 'Awhi whƒÅnau' for whƒÅnau caring for the children of family members. The majority of children in this network are supported by the 'At home' model.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is based on the Reggio Emilia approach where positive relationships are promoted and children are at the forefront of learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four home-based education and care network reviews in the in the Creators @ Home service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a strong focus on the service philosophy that places the child at the centre of all decision making and fosters partnerships in learning with parents and whƒÅnau. Children have many opportunities to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand in ways that are meaningful to them and respectful of MƒÅori culture. Visiting teachers value the home cultures of children and families as the foundation for, and key to, their success. Children with additional needs, including English language learners, are well supported to develop a good sense of belonging and wellbeing to progress their learning.</p><p>The specific needs of infants and toddlers, including specific resourcing and appropriate learning experiences, are well considered. Visiting teachers and educarers work collaboratively to respond to each child‚Äôs changing needs and preferences.</p><p>Visiting teachers foster reciprocal relationships and partnerships in learning, based on a model of ako (learning together). They encourage inclusive learning environments where trust and a shared understanding of teaching, underpinned by Te WhƒÅriki (2017) The Early Childhood Curriculum, supports children's learning dispositions. Visiting teachers encourage educarers to reflect on their values, beliefs and attitudes to support the development of culturally responsive practices. This informs the localised curriculum and encourages educarers to develop skills and confidence in tikanga and te reo MƒÅori. Authentic relationships between teachers, educarers and whƒÅnau promote positive partnerships that are focused on the interests, strengths and capabilities of children.</p><p>Visiting teachers empower educarers to work in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau to support the learning and wellbeing of children. This collaborative approach helps tamariki to be confident and competent learners and communicators, which aligns with the service's philosophy. Parents and whƒÅnau are well informed about their children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing through a range of digital platforms which include learning stories and moderated social media.</p><p>There is very good provision of appropriate professional development for visiting teachers and educarers to build teaching capability and leadership capacity. Teachers make good use of external expertise to review the learning that matters to provide equitable opportunities for children. They are building a reflective teaching and learning culture that is focused on ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the national leaders of the service agree that the key next steps to strengthen governance processes and practices are to:</p><ul>
<li>give prominence to bicultural perspectives in key guiding documentation and practices</li>
<li>develop a robust strategic approach to promote educational success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori</li>
<li>refine, develop and evaluate strategic and annual action planning of key service and regional priorities</li>
<li>further develop new performance management and appraisal systems to ensure full understanding and alignment to the requirements of the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the national and regional leaders agree that the key next steps for the network are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop educarer and caregiver understandings of Te WhƒÅriki (2017) to strengthen assessment for and of children's learning</li>
<li>continue to develop self-review practices to inform deeper levels of inquiry and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Compliance Actions</h3><p>The national and regional leaders must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes and practices for teachers align to the requirements of the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creators@Home - Southland completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>16 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
