</table><p>The Nurtury <em>requires further development</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The September 2011 ERO Education Review, identified a number of issues that related to the quality of learning, teaching and management of the centre. The centre was provided with external support from the Ministry of Education (MoE) and ERO, to develop an action plan and to participate in professional development.</p><p>The March 2013 ERO review found little progress had occurred. In October 2012 there had been changes in centre ownership and the management team. The new management team were unaware of the action plan, and what needed to occur to improve the quality of learning.</p><p>This review identified that significant changes were beginning to occur since a new manager was appointed in the latter months of 2013. The manager needs more external support to implement and sustain the new management systems and practices to improve the quality of learning and teaching for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Nurtury caters for babies and children to school age in separate nursery and preschool areas. Nearly all the teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The centre roll is multicultural and is located in a rural setting near Halswell. The grounds are spacious and well maintained. Children, with their teachers regularly visit a farmyard and gym that are beside the centre but not part of the playground.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between the children and teachers are warm, respectful and caring. Teachers have a good knowledge and understanding of each child and their family. They keep families well informed and involve them in decision making for their child and the centre.</p><p>Children in the preschool are very well supported to develop good social skills and confidently relate to others. They play cooperatively in small groups and share ideas and resources.</p><p>The nursery provides a calm and welcoming environment for children and their families. Teachers acknowledge infants and toddlers as individuals, and know their personalities, and likes and dislikes well. They actively seek to involve infants and toddlers in decisions about their care and their play.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of all children and families. Children with special needs are well integrated into the programme and supported by the teachers in their learning and development. Children‚Äôs home cultures are respected and included in the programme where possible.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is becoming more evident in the programme as staff consult more regularly with their MƒÅori parents.</p><p>Children in the nursery and the preschool are developing a good knowledge and enjoyment of music with support from a teacher who has special skills in this area.</p><p>The new manager is developing some useful systems and practices but these are at an early stage. Good relationships are evident between management and staff who are involved in decision making for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and ERO agree that high priority needs to be given to establishing systems and practices that will sustain the centre and improve capability. These include:</p><ul>
<li>developing and implementing plans that provide clear direction for the ongoing development of the centre, including bicultural perspectives</li>
<li>establishing an ongoing programme of self review and programme evaluation</li>
<li>improving consistency and the usefulness of assessment in children‚Äôs learning, planning and teaching.</li>
</ul><p>The managers and teachers also need to review group times in the preschool to ensure they meet the centre‚Äôs vision for children‚Äôs learning and the principles of Te WhƒÅriki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Nurtury completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to centre management and the curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>governance and management systems, practices and documentation including establishing an ongoing programme of self review</li>
<li>planning, implementing and evaluating the curriculum to enhance the quality of learning and teaching, that is consistent with the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></li>
</ul><p><em>47(1) (a) (c); 43(1)(a) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Nurtury will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>12 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
