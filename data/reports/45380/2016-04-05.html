</table><p>The Nurtury is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Nurtury caters for babies and children to school age in separate nursery and preschool areas. The grounds are spacious and well maintained. An area set up with gym equipment and an area with farmyard animals are regularly used by the centre to extend children's daily learning experiences.</p><p>The centre owners live overseas but are in regular contact with, and provide ongoing support to, the centre leaders and staff. The centre manager works closely with the head teacher to manage the day-to-day running of the centre. There is a team leader in each of the nursery and preschool areas responsible for ensuring the daily programme is well implemented. The majority of staff are fully trained and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review found that the centre needed to make improvements in governance and management, self review, planning and programme evaluation. Since that time the centre has appointed a new manager and head teacher. Centre leaders have worked with Ministry of Education (MOE) support, to bring about considerable improvements in practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers have developed a shared philosophy for teaching and learning that better reflects and supports their practice.</p><p>The programme is appropriately based on following children’s interests. Flexible routines are supporting children to make their own choices about the pace of their day. Children have good opportunities to contribute to decisions about how the daily programme is set up.</p><p>Children are provided with a wide range of learning experiences, in the centre and beyond. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an emphasis on supporting children's wellbeing through physical play and healthy eating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities to learn about how to care for animals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chances to explore and play in natural settings.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers and children have positive and affirming relationships. Teachers support children to have successful social interactions with each other.</p><p>Teachers regularly identify priorities for individual children and deliberately plan opportunities to support children’s learning in these areas.</p><p>Teachers have recently focused on more formally seeking parent aspirations for their children’s learning. They provide social opportunities for families to be involved in the centre and see their cultures recognised in displays.</p><p>Teachers have extended their links and professional conversations with local schools to support children as they move from the centre to school.</p><p>The new leadership team is working well. It has supported centre improvements and promoted a greater focus on raising expectations for teaching and learning.</p><p>Centre leaders have implemented clearer systems for monitoring and reporting on aspects of the service's operation. Teachers now receive constructive feedback on the quality of assessment practices. A more robust teacher appraisal system has been recently introduced. There is more informative reporting to owners and the centre manager about centre management.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed useful long-term planning to identify centre priorities and support centre improvement. They have made significant use of professional learning and development and seeking advice from the MoE at a management level to improve centre practices.</p><p>Staff strengths are well used. Teachers are provided with good opportunities to develop leadership capabilities.</p><p>A useful process to help guide internal evaluation has been established. Teachers are increasingly reflective about their practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owners, centre leaders and ERO agree, that the key next steps to improving outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to improve aspects of planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teaching approaches that extend children's thinking and problem solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building on initial work done in developing more robust appraisal practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending teachers' awareness of Māori perspectives within the programme and centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening aspects of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Nurtury will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>5 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

</div><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
