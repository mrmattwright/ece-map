</table><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Manurewa¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Manurewa requires ongoing support from Barnardos managers to continue improving the quality of the curriculum, programme planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Manurewa is licensed to provide for 50 children, including 12 up to two years of age. Most of the children attending have MƒÅori or Pacific heritage, and many are learning to speak English as an additional language.</p><p>The centre employs six qualified teachers, one teacher trainee and a cook. The teaching team is comprised of a number of recent appointments including a centre manager.</p><p>The centre is part of Barnardos New Zealand, a longstanding organisation with a clear strategic focus on social services and advocacy for tamariki, and whƒÅnau, and excellence in early childhood care and education. The Barnardos board works with executive and senior leadership teams. Two Upper North Regional managers and a practice adviser work alongside centre-based and home-based managers in Auckland. The appointment of a second professional practice adviser is imminent.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in Barnardos New Zealand Early Learning Services.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are focused on providing play activities and consistent routines for children to develop social competence. They are in the early stages of learning to be more responsive to children's interests.</p><p>Children are keen to engage in play with their peers and to interact with adults. However, their play does not progress beyond a basic level and tends to shift quickly from one play area to another. Teachers are not yet interacting well with children to develop their social competence, sustained complex play or language development through conversations about their play.</p><p>Children under the age of two years have good opportunities for exploratory play at an unhurried pace. Teachers are respectful to children and read their cues well. Teachers are yet to access professional learning and development that is specific to the infant and toddler age group.</p><p>Teachers establish good relationships with parents. There are some examples where parent/teacher partnerships and external agency support have impacted well on outcomes for children with additional learning needs. These approaches are supporting these children's wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The centre manager and leaders are aware that there is a need to develop shared understandings of the centre's philosophy, teacher capability and a culture of improvement. A planned review of the philosophy should contribute to improving the quality of teaching to realise the centre's philosophy and implement <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Barnardos has aligned organisational strategic priorities with its vision, philosophy and valued outcomes for children. The organisation has recently introduced a number of new initiatives and improved systems for accountability and quality assurance, to support increasing capability and consistency across Barnardos early learning services. Many new initiatives are at early stages of implementation. Managers make purposeful use of a quality assurance framework and progress towards strategic goals is systematically monitored and reported. The impact of new developments on outcomes for children is not yet evident. The appointment of a second practice adviser should support a shift in focus from compliance to quality improvement.</p><p>Barnardos leaders have developed a strategic approach to strengthening understandings of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori and culturally responsive practices. Specific Barnardos initiatives respond to the diverse needs of children and their families. In this service there is capability amongst the teaching team to strengthen the development of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori and Pacific values and approaches in the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that external professional support will be necessary for teachers to improve the quality of the curriculum, programme planning, assessment and evaluation. Priorities for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support all staff and parents to have a shared understanding about the centre's philosophy statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve teachers' understanding of children's learning and development, and best practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement positive guidance and teaching strategies that encourage children's social and emotional competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement an ongoing process of internal evaluation that helps the service to continually improve the quality of programmes and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During ERO‚Äôs September 2018 cluster, Barnardos leaders identified relevant next steps relating to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding and evaluating the impact of new initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the establishment of systems for monitoring and evaluating progress towards strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation at all levels, including ‚Äòteaching as inquiry‚Äô.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This review also identified the need for the practice advisers to continue providing close support for teaching teams to improve culturally responsive practices, curriculum quality and the implementation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017.</p><p>Barnardos managers have provided ERO with an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement in this centre, including health and safety concerns, will be addressed. ERO will evaluate the extent of this progress within six months.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre Manurewa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum. In order to address this, managers and teachers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning, and evaluation (documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children‚Äôs learning, their interests, whƒÅnau, and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum and staff practice supports children‚Äôs developing social competence and understanding of appropriate behaviour through positive guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the practices of adults providing education and care demonstrate an understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development, and knowledge of current relevant theories and practice in early childhood education.</p>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
