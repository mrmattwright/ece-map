<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Tauranga Region Kindergartens (TRK) is a non-profit community based organisation that maintains its focus on providing quality homebased childcare services, known as Papa K&#257;inga, to children and families. Responsive and reciprocal relationships with families and communities and ensuring the principles of sustainability and Te Tiriti o Waitangi remain central to all of the organisation&rsquo;s operations.</p><p>The service caters for children from birth to school age in the Tauranga region, Whitianga, Rotorua and Taupo. Within Papa K&#257;inga educational support and mentoring is provided for educators caring for children in private homes and for caregivers of foster children under school age. At the time of this review 49 children were enrolled, of whom 16 are identified as being of M&#257;ori descent.</p><p>Caregivers and educators have access to a wide variety of quality educational opportunities, which is enhancing the quality of education and care provided. Regular visits from qualified coordinators to children and their educator/caregiver make a positive and constructive contribution to the quality of education provided and children&rsquo;s wellbeing. Parents and wh&#257;nau views and aspirations for their children are sought and valued.</p><p>The service is well led by highly qualified, experienced and knowledgeable coordinators. They work collaboratively to review and strengthen the service&rsquo;s ability to meet community needs and promote positive educational outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>TRK operates two homebased childcare service networks and provides full professional and managerial support. One network is quality funded and the other standard funded, reflecting the level of educator and caregiver qualifications.</p><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s last review in September 2010, the service has extended beyond Tauranga, to include Whitianga, Rotorua and Taupo. In line with this expansion four more coordinators have been employed. One coordinator has particular responsibility for supporting caregivers of young children in foster care.</p><p>Professional learning and development, including participation in research projects and conferences has led to enhanced practice, learning and ongoing self review.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>TRK provides effective governance and management of Papa K&#257;inga. The needs, ideas and aspirations of parents, communities and staff influence the vision, values and strategic direction of the organisation. Significant features of governance and management include focused self review and responsive professional learning and development for coordinators, educators and caregivers. The service provided by Papa K&#257;inga is responsive to the context, expectations and desired outcomes for children. There is strong acknowledgement of tangata whenua values and effective promotion of teaching and learning about te Ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>The senior coordinator is a highly effective professional leader of the service. She has established respectful and reciprocal relationships at all levels of Papa K&#257;inga and within the wider community. Her knowledge and inclusive, collaborative approach builds the individual capability of coordinators, educators/caregivers, children and wh&#257;nau. The coordinator team and educators/caregivers are strong advocates for the rights of children. Coordinators skilfully promote reflective practice and are responsive to diversity within the team of educators/caregivers enhancing positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The service&rsquo;s philosophy is based on a &lsquo;circle of care&rsquo; where each child&rsquo;s holistic development is central to all decision making. Values of trust, empathy, hope, respect, affection, communication, care and love are fostered in the curriculum. Children benefit from enriching experiences that include:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for learning and exploration in the wider community through kimi haere experiences, in the natural environment, and visits to libraries and playgroups</li>
<li>an emphasis on literacy, mathematics and science in contexts that are meaningful to children</li>
<li>making connections with stories, people and places that are significant to tangata whenua</li>
<li>access to a range of resources to extend children's interest and learning and meet particular care needs</li>
<li>learning journals that affirm each child&rsquo;s learning and experiences.</li>
</ul><p>Respectful relationships and sharing of information between parents and educators and caregivers, including sharing of in-depth knowledge enables responsive care and education for individual children. Home settings are skilfully adapted to create interesting and responsive learning environments where children demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. They confidently engage in play, exploration and regular routines that promote independence. Coordinators, educators and caregivers interactions with children are positive and sensitive. They listen carefully to children and use a range of strategies to extend children's language, thinking and social skills.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO and service leaders agree that important areas for continued development include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing shared understanding and expectations for assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthening the knowledge, confidence and practices of coordinators, educators and caregivers in relation to te Ao M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Tauranga Regional Free Kindergarten Association - Home Based Childcare completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>11 December 2013</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
