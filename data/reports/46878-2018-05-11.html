</table><p>The Home Grown Education director and staff require external support to improve the quality of governance, health and safety, and curriculum practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Home Grown Education is licensed to provide education and care for up to 60 children. This is the first review of the service since it became licensed in 2016. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. At present there are 19 children on the roll. Most are from Pacific backgrounds.</p><p>The service's philosophy expresses a commitment to providing meaningful learning experiences that support children to be successful. Diversity is celebrated and there is a strong focus on building children's sense of self through their culture and home language.</p><p>The owner director is the service's director. She leads the two coordinators, professional development for educators, and the overall governance and management of the service. The director and coordinators have early childhood qualifications. The service employs an administrator.</p><p>Since the service was established the director has led assessment and programme planning for children. She has supported educators to implement plans and monitor health and safety. The service offers educational courses for parents and educators, and regular playgroups for children.</p><p>This review identifies that significant development is needed in all aspects of operation including the documentation of health and safety systems. The director and coordinators should develop robust operational and management systems to support educators to improve programmes for children. External professional support is needed to help achieve required improvements.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is influenced by the philosophy of Reggio Emilia. There is a strong focus on outdoor education and the natural environment. The resources offered help to develop children's curiosity through science, maths and literacy. Children participate in excursions that foster social confidence and knowledge of the wider community. The service works with parents to support successful transitions to school.</p><p>Documentation shows that children are provided with a variety of home-based experiences. Many activities are linked to children's cultures and languages. Systems for providing for children's learning and monitoring coordinator visits could be improved to ensure consistent good practice across all home settings. The owner has a strong commitment to strengthening bicultural practice within the service.</p><p>Some documents show how children's individual interests are used as a basis for planning. Records of children's learning and development should also show how adults respond to children's individual interests, strengths and dispositions.</p><p>The director works with coordinators and plans professional development to build educator capacity. A stronger focus could be put on guiding educators to support children's learning and build their knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Recent professional learning opportunities for educators have focused on children's oral language development. Coaching educators to increase their professional knowledge and more systematic monitoring of the outcomes of their learning could help to improve programmes for children.</p><p>A process of internal evaluation is being established to guide improvement and accountability. The service's strategic plan is based on a business model. The director should develop and implement long-term and annual action plans that align with the service's strategic intent and inform internal evaluation priorities.</p><p>The director has sought support from an independent agency to improve financial management and practices. Guidance and support from an external facilitator will also be necessary to ensure that teachers' appraisals meet Education Council requirements.</p><p>The director articulates a strong commitment to implementing a home-based service that empowers parent educators. It is timely to review the service's framework of policies and procedures against recent changes in legal requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director should access external support to improve governance, health and safety, and curriculum practices and systems. She agrees that key next steps to improve the service include:</p><ul>
<li>developing strategic goals and an annual action plan to guide ongoing improvement</li>
<li>implementing internal evaluation processes, including a schedule of policy review and development, and the evaluation of progress towards annual and strategic goals</li>
<li>improving systems for establishing and monitoring provision for children's health and safety</li>
<li>implementing policies and procedures to reflect legal requirements, particularly in relation to employment practices.</li>
<li>Priorities for improving curriculum leadership include:</li>
<li>documenting coordinators' coaching and mentoring conversations with educators</li>
<li>implementing a suitable process for educators to plan, assess and evaluate children's learning and development, which include challenges for older children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Home Grown Education completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, the owner should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>risk analysis and management processes for excursions are robust</li>
<li>educators' induction includes information about required health and safety practices</li>
<li>provisions for children's health and safety are regularly monitored.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, health and safety, and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing programmes that reflect an understanding of learning and development, relevant theories and practices, and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a process for the evaluation of all aspects of service operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring child protection, adult safety checking and police vetting policies and practices are documented and implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the coordinator's annual appraisals meet Education Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintaining financial management and records.</p>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
