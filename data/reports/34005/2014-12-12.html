</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Campus Creche Trust is located on the Waikato University Campus. It provides full-day education and care for children from three months to school age. Most parents or caregivers attend or work at the university. The service provides for a diverse group of children, who represent a number of ethnic groups and cultures. High value is placed on culture, identity and diversity. Cultural differences are embraced and celebrated. At the time of this ERO review 139 children were enrolled, 49 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>This service is governed by a non-profit charitable trust. The trust includes university, parent and teacher representatives and the director, who manages the centres. Trustees bring a wide range of skills and expertise to their roles and they provide a clear strategic direction to guide and govern centre operations.</p><p>The service is organised into five separate age-based centres. Each centre has its own building and thoughtfully designed learning environments. Each centre is resourced, organised and managed to strengthen the interests and meet the needs of the specific group, age and ability levels of children.</p><p>Since the previous ERO reviews in 2011, all five centres have merged under one licence with the Ministry of Education. The assistant director has left but the director has remained in her position. She has continued to provide effective management, and professional support and advice to senior, head teachers, the trust and teachers.</p><p>In some centres, new managers have been appointed and changes have occurred within teaching teams. These changes allow more flexibility, better use of staff skills and expertise and support the transition processes that occur as children move through the centres. The organisation continues to maintain a high level of qualified, experienced and enthusiastic teaching and support staff.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the service has further developed their strategic planning and self-review practices. Teachers have taken part in action research projects in relation to nature-based education. Their successful experiences have led to the provision of professional learning and development for other teachers within the early childhood sector. Teachers have continued to have ongoing access to effective and useful professional development. This has assisted them to keep up-to-date with new practice and ideas. The service has had a very positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Campus Creche Trust‚Äôs philosophy, vision, goals and systems contribute to positive learning outcomes for all children. High value is placed on Treaty of Waitangi principles and these are reflected in organisation policies and practices. Effective self-review procedures ensure that the organisation remains focused on accountability and improved performance at all levels. The clear alignment from the strategic plan through to the annual plan and centre planning affirms the focus on common goals and objectives. This alignment is also extended through to the organisation‚Äôs performance management and appraisal processes. The processes used demonstrate a clear understanding by staff of organisational standards and expectations.</p><p>The director provides highly effective professional leadership to a diverse and committed group of teaching and support staff. She has worked collaboratively with staff, parents and the trust to lead and complete a challenging yet successful review of the organisational structure. As a result of the review, head teachers have taken on more responsibilities and these opportunities have strengthened their leadership skills and capabilities. The focus on succession planning supports emerging leadership and creativity among staff. Highly effective governance from the Trust and strong leadership within the organisation contributes to positive outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau/families.</p><p>The holistic and inclusive curriculum is well designed to promote high-quality learning outcomes for all children. Teachers skilfully integrate the creative arts and learning in early literacy, mathematics, and science at all levels and stages of the learning programme. Flexible routines, and regular celebrations, trips and community events enrich children‚Äôs learning. The number of ethnic groups and cultures are embraced in a number of ways. Parents are encouraged to share their own cultural practices with children and staff, and different languages are used and learnt to affirm the identity of families. Staff members also represent different cultures and this knowledge is well used and incorporated into centre routines, events and celebrations.</p><p>The integration of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori culture and practices reinforces the importance of the role of tangata whenua. Aotearoa/New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage is celebrated and embraced within each centre programme. All children benefit from the enthusiasm and commitment by staff and whƒÅnau to practice and incorporate MƒÅori culture and use te reo MƒÅori in a range of different contexts. Effective and focused professional learning and development is also having a major impact on staff confidence and commitment to extending the MƒÅori perspective and bicultural content of each centre learning programme.</p><p>Particular strengths across the curriculum in each centre are as follows:</p><h4>Wheki (infants)</h4><p>Personalised care routines are highly responsive to the specific interests, strengths and needs of infants. Teachers work in close partnership with families.</p><h4>Kowhai (infants and toddlers)</h4><p>Teachers view infants and toddlers as capable and competent learners and teachers, notice, recognise and respond to their strengths, interests and needs. Children‚Äôs social skills are nurtured and extended through experiencing regular outings and visits to the other centres.</p><h4>Nikau (toddlers)</h4><p>Children experience an inclusive programme that is highly responsive to their specific interests, strengths and needs. Their cultural identities are affirmed and celebrated. Toddlers are provided with many opportunities to engage in sustained learning.</p><h4>Maire (toddlers and young children)</h4><p>Whanaungatanga is skilfully integrated into the learning programme. Relationships are meaningful and appropriate. Each child‚Äôs cultural identity is valued and celebrated. Children benefit from extensive outings in the community. Children‚Äôs learning is promoted as a result of these opportunities.</p><h4>Kauri (young children)</h4><p>Children experience a programme that encourages them to direct their own learning, make their own choices and confidently assess situations and take informed risks. They are provided with many sustained and complex learning opportunities. A major focus is the opportunity to participate and contribute to the nature-based programme on a regular basis. Learning is enhanced as a result of these learning experiences.</p><p>In all centres, teachers‚Äô relationships and interactions with children and their families/whƒÅnau are trusting, respectful and caring. Teams work collaboratively with families to ensure the positive transition of children into and between centres. Sibling and tuakana-teina relationships are enhanced by visits between centres, and families are encouraged to spend time with their children in each centre.</p><p>Teachers know children well and are responsive to the diverse needs of families. Teachers have a good understanding of each family‚Äôs aspirations for their children. Families are kept well informed about children‚Äôs learning through daily conversations, high-quality assessment folders and displays of their child‚Äôs work. The use of email and digital portfolios has significantly increased the sharing of learning between families and individual teachers. Strong relationships and partnerships are developed between teachers and whƒÅnau/families.</p><p>Teachers make good use of learning conversations to extend children‚Äôs language and social skills. They respond enthusiastically to children‚Äôs emerging needs and interests. Teachers value and affirm children‚Äôs independence, strengths and capabilities. Teachers use their home languages and second language skills to promote and affirm children‚Äôs ethnicity and culture.</p><p>Spacious and well-designed environments have a positive impact on children‚Äôs learning. Teachers skilfully resource and present the environment to stimulate children‚Äôs curiosity, play and exploration. Children have independent access to a wide variety of high-quality materials, resources and equipment. Active exploration is supporting children to become capable and competent learners and communicators.</p><p>Visits to natural-environments provide extensive opportunities for children to engage in imaginative play, make choices, and extend their physical capabilities. A major strength of the programme is the extensive opportunities to learn about sustainability and caring for the environment. These experiences support children to learn, explore and develop their own understanding of the world around them.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO supports the service‚Äôs current self-review focus, which is to continue their action research project to further extend their own knowledge and understandings of the development and implementation of the bicultural curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Campus Creche Trust completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Campus Creche Trust will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
