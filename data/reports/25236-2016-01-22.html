</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tui Playcentre is a long established centre in residential Papatoetoe, Auckland. It has recently reopened after an eighteen month closure while being renovated. Long standing centre members have remained and are working to rebuild the numbers of families using the centre to make its operation more viable. The centre is open for three morning sessions per week for up to 25 children.</p>
<p>The centre is one of 16 Playcentres in the Tamaki Playcentre Association. The Association provides a management and policy framework to guide centre operations. Liaison officers and other Association staff provide support for the centres, including adult education programmes to encourage children‚Äôs learning.</p>
<p>The centre is cooperatively managed and programmes for children are implemented by centre members who have many years' experience. The Playcentre philosophy of whƒÅnau and children learning together underpins centre operations.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of three Playcentre reviews in the Tamaki Playcentre Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children show a strong sense of trust and of belonging. They confidently approach adults to ask questions, share achievements and socialise. Children play independently and cooperatively with each other. They choose from a wide range of easily accessible resources when initiating their own play. The centre has a sense of calm and purposefulness.</p>
<p>Adults/whƒÅnau value children‚Äôs play. They follow and support children in the session. Children‚Äôs ethnic language is valued and encouraged. Adults provide a range of literacy activities that enable children to observe, listen and practise language. They use open questions to encourage children to develop language skills, think critically and problem solve.</p>
<p>The centre programme is clearly linked to the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A key feature in this centre is the way in which members‚Äô are beginning to use learning dispositions well to build on children‚Äôs skills. This is having an impact on children‚Äôs learning and is a result of recent professional development for members undertaken following focused self review to identify next steps for progressing the centre.</p>
<p>Te reo MƒÅori is strongly integrated throughout the programme. Children benefit from a focused commitment to New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. Multicultural aspects are also developing within centre programmes.</p>
<p>Centre members work collaboratively to provide well-coordinated and purposefully resourced programmes. They respect each child‚Äôs uniqueness and build on their interests.</p>
<p>Adults evaluate each session to help them plan future programmes. The shared knowledge they have about individual children and families promotes a cohesive learning environment.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the umbrella Tamaki Playcentre Association, Tui Playcentre has developed a tailored strategy to support the re-establishment of its renovated centre. A position of pouawhina has been created to complement the existing members‚Äô skills. The pouawhina is helping to ensure that the Playcentre is well organised and managed. This strategy allows the experienced adults to concentrate on supporting the children with their play. Continuing education and training for all adults is an ongoing priority.</p>
<p>Association governance practices are well established. Raising awareness of the playcentre within the community so that centres are well attended is an ongoing focus for the Association. The Association is responsive to the needs of individual centres and provides support and guidance to manage the centres. Members are appreciative of the Association‚Äôs collaborative approach to assist them in promoting positive outcomes for children. Association leaders have made significant progress in aligning and monitoring systems and practices for centres. They could now further strengthen processes for reporting and monitoring progress in each centre.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Centre members and ERO agree that key next steps include:</p>
<ul><li>develop strategies for responding in a more timely and responsive to children‚Äôs emerging interests and for developing the complexity of their learning</li>
<li>responding more strategically to the diverse cultures and languages of children and their families/whƒÅnau</li>
<li>continuing to develop supports and systems for a collaborative and interdependent community</li>
<li>promoting the centre and attracting new members.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tui Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Tui Playcentre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
