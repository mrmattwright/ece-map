</table><p>Ohakea Childcare Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ohakea Childcare Centre is one of two centres owned and operated by a sole trader. It is a mixed-age group service licensed for 23 children, including 13 up to the age of two. Of the 43 children enrolled, at the time of this review, 13 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The owner oversees management and staff employment. The day-to-day operation of the service is delegated to the centre supervisor. An assistant supervisor supports her in leading curriculum implementation. Determining and achieving the service's strategic direction and annual goals is undertaken collaboratively by the manager and all teaching staff. Four full time teachers have an early childhood qualification. Three have full certification and one is provisionally certificated. Of the four part time educators, two have been at the centre for a significant length of time.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes the values of strong relationships with families, whƒÅnau and the community. Intended outcomes of the localised curriculum include celebrating multiculturalism, children experiencing a safe and nurturing environment that fosters their curiosity and that teaching practice and children's learning will reflect <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em>.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two centres owned by the sole trader.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's curiosity and active exploration is fostered through their engagement in a range of planned and spontaneous learning activities and experiences. Learners of mixed ages play amicably alongside each other. Opportunities for children to participate in learning outside of the centre enriches their early childhood experience.</p><p>Strategies in place to involve parents, whƒÅnau and aiga in their children's learning continue to evolve. Warm, reciprocal relationships with parents and between staff is evident. These and the high ratio of adults to children enable teachers to know children's preferences and needs well.</p><p>Curriculum provision for infants and toddlers focuses on nurturing their wellbeing. Teachers should further inquire into, and evaluate practice, to be assured that teaching and learning experiences always support these young children's progress and holistic development.</p><p>Leaders' and teachers' cultural competence is well supported through professional learning and development. This results in an increased inclusion of te ao MƒÅori and Pacific culture in the curriculum. MƒÅori, and all children increasingly experience te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori as a meaningful and authentic part of their early childhood experience.</p><p>Children identified as requiring additional learning support are well catered for. When appropriate, the service works with external agencies and together they collaborate with families and whƒÅnau to develop individual learning programmes for these children.</p><p>Establishing an effective collaborative approach to teaching and learning is a strategic priority. Systems in place support this. A culture of collaboration has extended to leaders and teachers employed in both services owned by the licensee. Teachers work cooperatively on shared developments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers need to build their individual and collective capability to lead and carry out effective internal evaluation practices. This should assist them to know:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>what is working well in the curriculum and for who; define limitations and identify where further developments are necessary to improve outcomes for children and their families and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how effectively the centre philosophy is enacted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how well assessment practice for teaching and learning promotes the expressed outcomes of the service and <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Systems and processes for building leaders' and teachers' capability require strengthening. The manager needs to ensure the appraisal process is rigorously implemented. Goals and development actions should be responsive to the needs of leaders and individual teachers. Practices for endorsing and renewing teachers' practising certificates must meet all the requirements of the Teaching Council.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ohakea Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ohakea Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>5 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
