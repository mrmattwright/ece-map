<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>ACG Strathallan Preschool Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. There are sound management processes in place and children&rsquo;s learning and development continues to be well supported.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>ACG Strathallan Preschool Centre provides education and care for children from infancy to school age in a purpose built facility on the grounds of the ACG Strathallan School Campus, in Karaka, Auckland. In December 2011 the infants, junior and senior preschool areas combined to form one large centre. The good practices noted in previous ERO reports have been sustained. Children continue to learn in attractive, well resourced areas and have many opportunities to make choices within carefully structured programmes.</p><p>The service is affiliated to the Academic Colleges Group (ACG). There is a high level of qualified staff and very good adult-to-child ratios. The centre manager works closely with the executive principal of ACG Strathallan Campus to ensure management expectations are clear and quality assurance is robust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers plan and implement programmes that reflect their teaching philosophy, prioritise academic knowledge, and are influenced <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers provide an inclusive and welcoming environment in which children are developing a strong sense of themselves as successful learners. Each of the areas is very well equipped, attractive and purpose built. Infants receive good quality care and individualised routines. Teachers have skilful interactions, high expectations and sustained conversations with children. Children are well supported to:</p><ul>
<li>develop sound literacy and numeracy skills and to have meaningful science experiences</li>
<li>be curious, eager to learn and persist at challenging activities</li>
<li>engage in cooperative play and high level discussion</li>
<li>explore ways to be creative through art, music and drama</li>
<li>share ideas, problem solve and make good choices.</li>
</ul><p>Children are confident, competent learners who show a growing sense of personal and social responsibility.</p><p>Vibrant displays of children&rsquo;s past and current interests show children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme and provide good information for parents. Planning could now be further developed by reviewing how effectively the extension of children&rsquo;s emerging individual interests, opportunities for children&rsquo;s leadership of learning, and bicultural leaning experiences are reflected in the programme.</p><p>The centre has well established and effective management and administration systems. Policies have been adapted to reflect the individual expectations and aspirations of centre managers. Clear administration systems and well maintained centre records help to ensure that the centre functions smoothly and that children receive good quality care.</p><p>Centre managers and other staff have developed effective partnerships with parents and make useful links between home and centre for children. Parent contributions to policy reviews are valued. Useful information about children&rsquo;s progress and about centre programme focuses and events is often shared with families.</p><p>Good working relationships between management and staff are evident. Performance management systems that promote good quality teaching practices and leadership opportunities are in place, and a supportive working environment and staff stability contribute positively to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Centre managers have identified self review as an area for ongoing development. They agree that they could increase the depth and perspectives of their self-review processes. Developments in this area could include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers reflecting on how their philosophy and centre policies are evident in their teaching practice</li>
<li>increasing the focus on, and visibility of, biculturalism in programme implementation and centre reviews</li>
<li>ensuring annual plans include more specific goals so that outcomes for children can be more readily evaluated.</li>
</ul><p>Work on the above aspects of self review should support management&rsquo;s focus on continuous improvement.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ACG Strathallan Preschool Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.
