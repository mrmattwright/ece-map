Since the 2008 ERO report the centre has had a new licensee and management structure.

Toddlers are able to explore and experiment in ways that best meet their developmental needs.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Mana Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the services&rsquo; vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou&#257;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within all these areas, ERO considers how the quality and sustainability of partnerships with wh&#257;nau, and the effectiveness of self review, ensure that the service is well placed to continue to make improvements for the benefit of all children attending the service. ERO&rsquo;s findings are set out below.</p><h3>How well placed is Tautua Aoga Amata to promote positive outcomes for all children?</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Despite the financial constraints of previous years, teachers have continued to provide a good programme in a supportive environment. The new management systems have enabled teachers to review resourcing needs and to provide a more stimulating environment.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><ul>
<li>Children can speak, sing, dance, communicate and interact using the Samoan language. Reciting Biblical verses is an important part of the centre philosophy and children do this well.</li>
<li>The physical environment is inviting and vibrant and reflects the Samoan heritage. There is a good range of resources and teachers skilfully integrate literacy and numeracy into mat times and children&rsquo;s play. The outdoor area is set up to support physical development, creativity, construction and imaginative play.</li>
<li>Teachers have high expectations of and trust in children. There are lots of meaningful, sustained conversations between children and adults. Teachers encourage children to respect one another and to build positive relationships.</li>
<li>Teachers support children&rsquo;s play choices, encourage children to develop leadership skills and to be independent and confident learners. Routines are well managed and meet the developmental needs and preferences of children.</li>
<li>Children engage well in centre activities. They can move freely between activities and have opportunities to explore and be creative. Children are busy and show enjoyment in what they are doing. They play cooperatively and are keen to join in play.</li>
<li>The licensee has developed sound management systems. This has been instrumental in providing a firm platform to improve all aspects of centre operations and contributes to teachers&rsquo; shared focus on providing children with high quality education and care.</li>
<li>The centre is a positive place to work. Teachers have clear roles and responsibilities and work well as a team.</li>
</ul><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p>Centre managers have identified the need to re-establish and further develop their focus on self review. External advice and guidance could assist teachers&rsquo; professional learning in this area.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Tautua Aoga Amata completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Infants and toddlers learn alongside older children, and teacher interactions with infants are caring and respectful. Toddlers are able to explore and experiment in ways that best meet their developmental needs.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
