</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manu Crescent Private Kindergarten is a small, privately owned centre that has operated in Upper Vogeltown, New Plymouth for 24 years. It is licensed for up to 20 children aged over two years. At the time of this review, 35 children were enrolled and two identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The service offers five daily sessions per week. Since the August 2013 ERO report, a six hour session has been implemented for two days per week.</p><p>A focus on education for sustainability and environmental practice is emphasised through the curriculum. Activities include regular exploration excursions into the local forest, gardening initiatives, weekly cooking of harvested fruit and vegetables grown at the kindergarten and local community garden.</p><p>The service has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the previous review, the two relieving teachers have been appointed to permanent positions. All teachers are qualified and fully registered.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed and frequently spend time at the centre. Teachers know the children and families well.</p><p>Children experience an environment that provides extensive opportunities for play, learning and exploration. The outdoor area is set up to invite responsible risk taking that empowers children to be active learners. They engage in physical activities with enthusiasm and confidence, challenging themselves to strengthen their skills and coordination. The indoor environment is thoughtfully laid out to give children ready access to resources for reading, art, construction and dramatic play.</p><p>Teachers nurture and encourage emerging interests, and support child-led inquiries and investigations. Children are active learners. Early literacy, numeracy and science are integrated meaningfully throughout the programme. Children gain foundational skills which support them to transition to school.</p><p>A bicultural focus is evident. A teacher has taken a leadership role and provides staff with knowledge to support their understanding of te ao MƒÅori. This is increasing teachers' confidence in the use of te¬†reo MƒÅori and supporting the development of a more culturally responsive programme of learning.</p><p>Children with additional needs are welcome at the centre. Teachers' highly inclusive practice and developed links with relevant community agencies aid them in supporting these children's participation in the programme.</p><p>Teachers observe children's play and regularly discuss and record their progress in a summative way. Learning and development is celebrated and shared between teachers and parents and whƒÅnau. It is timely to evaluate the kindergarten's assessment practices to identify how well the service provides meaningful opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute, in an ongoing way, to their child's learning.</p><p>The appraisal process provides opportunities for teachers to reflect on their practice. To further strengthen its approach, action plans should be developed to assist teachers to achieve their identified goals. This should support the monitoring of their progress and identification of next development steps.</p><p>There is a clear process for reviewing operation and practice. Building understanding of internal evaluation should help inform decision making. This should enable the leader and teachers to inquire more deeply in to how well the philosophy, the curriculum and teaching practices are enhancing positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Leadership is effective and improvement focused.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that the next developmental steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ongoing development of teachers' understanding and use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build the understanding of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manu Crescent Private Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Manu Crescent Private Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>26 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
