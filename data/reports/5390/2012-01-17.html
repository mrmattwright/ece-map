<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Wellington South Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation, is a recent positive initiative. The document provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten caters for children from 2 years of age and operates daily from 8.30 am to 1.30 pm. The kindergarten is located in the multicultural central city suburb of Newtown, which comprises a number of refugee and migrant communities. Children attending bring a rich diversity of cultural and language experiences.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten operates as an integrated service, an association initiative. A priority is to collaborate with a wide range of community services to act as a support network for families. Afternoon playgroups operate regularly and are supported by kindergarten staff.</p><p align="left">Since the May 2008 ERO review there have been major building alterations and improved access. Modifications to the indoor area, including the bathroom and kitchen facilities, have produced a well-organised and attractive space. Improved access to the outdoor area allows children to make choices about their play.</p><p align="left">Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and interact positively with each other in child-initiated play. Teachers know children well and are warm and welcoming in their interactions with them and their families. Children with special learning needs are well integrated into the programme and teachers work productively with families to provide appropriate care and support.</p><p align="left">Staff work collaboratively to develop a shared understanding of effective teaching and learning and consider ways to increase challenge and complexity in children&rsquo;s learning. Further development of processes in assessment and planning, and self review should strengthen practice and improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Wellington South Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWellington South Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the previous report, structural and physical developments have occurred, and there have been a number of staff changes. The current teaching team is supported by a recently appointed head teacher, the association, and a senior teacher who liaises with the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">In 2009 the kindergarten changed to an all day licence, which has improved teacher to child ratios. The kindergarten now operates 5-hour daily sessions. Children and families attending have a diverse range of cultural and language backgrounds.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Programme Child-initiated and play-based activities form the basis of the programme. Flexible routines support children&rsquo;s growing independence, which is actively fostered. Teachers provide a range of opportunities for revisiting and building on prior learning experiences. Children interact positively with others of different ethnic groups as they engage in independent and cooperative play. Teachers know children well in the context of their families. A commitment to bicultural practice is evident and aspects of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are integrated into the programme.</p><p align="left">Assessment, planning and evaluation Attractive and well-presented portfolios, documenting aspects of children&rsquo;s learning, are readily accessible to children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers use a narrative approach to highlight children&rsquo;s developing friendships and engagement in the programme.</p><p align="left">Interactions Teachers are positive, warm and welcoming in their interactions with children and their families. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and confidently approach teachers for support and assistance. Teachers are inclusive and recognise children&rsquo;s individual strengths and differences. They model strategies to encourage sharing, turn-taking and playing co-operatively. At times, children engage in sustained conversation with teachers who use rich, descriptive language and effective strategies to extend learning.</p><p align="left">Environment Children play in a well-organised and attractive space. A range of appropriate resources are available for them to freely access. Improved flow between the outdoor and indoor areas allows children to make choices about their play.</p><p align="left">Leadership and self review The new head teacher works productively to build a collaborative team and develop a shared understanding of effective teaching and learning. The kindergarten&rsquo;s senior teacher provides opportunities for useful professional discussion to guide teachers&rsquo; practice and aid reflection on their practices. Spontaneous reviews have resulted in improved outcomes for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Further consideration of ways to offer challenge and add complexity through interactions, programme and the environment is required. This would enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for thinking, reasoning and problem solving, and further engage them in rich, purposeful learning.</p><p align="left">As a new team, the teachers are examining their current practices to establish shared purposes and processes for planning and assessment. Processes to show how teachers identify and meet groups of children&rsquo;s interest are not yet formalised. Further documenting of planning should assist reflection on and evaluation of children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme. This is likely to more effectively guide the selection of teaching strategies that challenge, extend and support learning.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s portfolios should be further developed to more clearly demonstrate learning progress, invite contributions from children and their families, and identify possible lines of direction for future learning.</p><p align="left">The teaching team has identified they are in the early stages of developing their planned self-review practice. Establishing clear evaluative questions with specific indicators to examine and improve embedded practice, should strengthen the implementation of the process.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the strategic plan, setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Children with moderate to severe special needs are well integrated into the programme. Teachers work productively with families to provide appropriate care and support for their learning and development. They consider specific learning needs when making changes to their environment and programme.

<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation, is a recent positive initiative. The document provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten caters for children from 2 years of age and operates daily from 8.30 am to 1.30 pm. The kindergarten is located in the multicultural central city suburb of Newtown, which comprises a number of refugee and migrant communities. Children attending bring a rich diversity of cultural and language experiences.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten operates as an integrated service, an association initiative. A priority is to collaborate with a wide range of community services to act as a support network for families. Afternoon playgroups operate regularly and are supported by kindergarten staff.</p><p align="left">Since the May 2008 ERO review there have been major building alterations and improved access. Modifications to the indoor area, including the bathroom and kitchen facilities, have produced a well-organised and attractive space. Improved access to the outdoor area allows children to make choices about their play.</p><p align="left">Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and interact positively with each other in child-initiated play. Teachers know children well and are warm and welcoming in their interactions with them and their families. Children with special learning needs are well integrated into the programme and teachers work productively with families to provide appropriate care and support.</p><p align="left">Staff work collaboratively to develop a shared understanding of effective teaching and learning and consider ways to increase challenge and complexity in children&rsquo;s learning. Further development of processes in assessment and planning, and self review should strengthen practice and improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Kathleen Atkins</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
