</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wellington South Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te¬†Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The January 2012 ERO report for Wellington South Kindergarten identified that planning and assessment, self review, appraisal and implementation of Te Manawa needed further development. Many areas recognised as strengths have been sustained.</p><p>Areas where the association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association‚Äôs strategic priorities has now been addressed. A diverse programme and warm interactions between children and teachers continue to be strengths.</p><p>All teachers at Wellington South Kindergarten are qualified. At the time of this review, an appointment to the part-time teaching position was pending. The centre operates mixed-age sessions five days a week. Children attending the centre come from many different ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Aspects of the philosophy are highly evident in practice. Children are encouraged to lead learning for themselves and others. Their play is supported by teachers who use appropriate strategies to ensure they develop skills in English, as an additional language.</p><p>Teachers provide a child-centred and holistic curriculum that supports the learning needs of the ethnically diverse kindergarten community. Staff encourage children's exploration and investigation and support the development of their social behaviour. Child-initiated numeracy and literacy activities are highly evident.</p><p>Teachers have close ties with children and their families. Suitable processes support parents and children who have English as a second language. Entry to the kindergarten for these families is personalised and thoughtfully managed to meet families‚Äô individual needs. Support to prepare for progression to school is also given.</p><p>The consistency of quality in assessment of children‚Äôs learning and the sharing of this through individual profile books requires further development. They successfully respond to individual and group interests.</p><p>Self review is established and beginning to contribute to decision making and positive change. A next step is for teachers to further their understanding and implementation of these processes.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and work well together. Support for the development of teachers as leaders should be provided in a consistent, timely manner in order to ensure continued growth and development within the centre.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, and teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. These¬†continue to require development. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Children at Wellington South Kindergarten have frequent opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. There is a considered approach to sharing and respecting all cultures within the centre. Association leaders acknowledge that they need to build teachers‚Äô capability to be responsive to MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Wellington South Kindergarten:</p><ul>
<li>to review and strengthen assessment and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning, including the use and presentation of their profile books</li>
<li>to strengthen approaches for the development of professional practices and leadership within the centre, including self review and appraisal.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. These should include:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens</li>
<li>regular implementation of a robust appraisal system</li>
<li>building teachers‚Äô capability to be more responsive to MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wellington South Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, leaders need to be clear about how they use equity funding to promote learning and the sense of belonging for children and families.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Wellington South Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.
