</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park Mt Eden continues to provide high quality education and care within a programme that incorporates <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Reggio Emilia philosophy. Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, the centre has been merged with the adjacent infant and toddler centre under one licence. It is now licensed for 75 children and caters for children from three months to school age. Children play and learn together in age-appropriate groupings.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the Bear Park franchise. The franchise management group provides well developed policies, organisational frameworks and professional support. The strength of these systems and processes helped the smooth transition of centre ownership during 2012.</p><p>The Bear Park Pedagogical Team works across and within 10 centres to support teaching and learning. The centre owner oversees and guides day-to-day operations in collaboration with the supervisor and teachers.</p><p>The positive features of Bear Park Mt Eden that were acknowledged in ERO‚Äôs 2011 reports continue to be evident. Managers have responded well to ERO‚Äôs recommendation that staff enhance the programme to further support infants and toddlers as capable and competent learners. They have also implemented strategies to work more effectively with families and the wider community to enrich children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Ongoing professional learning has focused on developing planning and assessment approaches that are more responsive to children‚Äôs interests and working theories. The management team provides opportunities for all teachers to contribute to the drive and direction of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their parents/whƒÅnau to the centre. Children settle to their play and connect well with each other and their teachers. Trusting relationships between adults and between adults and children contribute to high quality learning interactions. Children have a strong sense of belonging. They are confident and collaborate well to support each other‚Äôs play. Teachers place importance on children leading their learning.</p><p>Active participation of parents in the life of the centre is encouraged and supported by teachers. Teachers have been deliberate in engaging parents and whƒÅnau in discussions about children‚Äôs learning. They have helped parents to understand how the Bear Park programme provides foundation learning for children‚Äôs future education. Parents report that their perspectives of their children‚Äôs learning are valued by teachers. Increasingly, parent voice is evident in records of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Children‚Äôs transitions to, and within the centre are well managed. As a result of the centre promoting successful partnerships with local schools, transitions of older children from the centre have been enhanced.</p><p>Children experience literacy, mathematics and the sciences in the centre‚Äôs richly resourced environment. Teachers support children's use of language and art in their investigations. Other features of effective teaching practice in the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>collaborative team work that is focused on responding to children‚Äôs different and emerging learning preferences</li>
<li>programme planning that values and responds to children‚Äôs perspectives</li>
<li>teachers enhancing learning by revisiting and building on children‚Äôs strengths and interests.</li>
</ul><p>Provision for children less than two years of age is well considered and nurturing. Teachers are sensitive to children‚Äôs preferences and requirements. They interact with these young children in a calm, unhurried way giving them time and space to lead their learning. A successful initiative to support younger children‚Äôs sense of security and identity has been the centre‚Äôs ‚Äòbuddy system‚Äô. As a result of this system, teachers have noticed that infants and toddlers have been more active participants in their learning.</p><p>MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture and identity are well catered for. Teachers reinforce the bicultural principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> by taking time to get to know MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau. Links have been made with a local marae and kohanga reo. Teachers see this developing relationship providing a means to enrich the centre‚Äôs te reo and tikanga MƒÅori programme. Pacific children‚Äôs different island heritages are valued. The centre owners share with staff their deep knowledge of the culture and language of different Pacific nations.</p><p>Strong centre direction is provided by centre owners and supervisors with support from the umbrella organisation. Governance and management of the centre is efficient and effective. Operational systems and processes are well connected and support a professional culture that is focused on what is best for children. Self review is used for ongoing centre improvement. An effective appraisal system supports teachers to reflect on ways they can promote children‚Äôs thinking and the complexity of their play. Teachers appreciate the very good amount of time and resources they have for their ongoing professional learning and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers discussed the following key next steps in this centre‚Äôs ongoing improvement:</p><ul>
<li>refining appraisal processes in order to support and enhance teachers‚Äô cultural responsiveness</li>
<li>continuing to promote bicultural practices by making te Ao MaÃÑori more visible in the learning environment.</li>
</ul><p>ERO is confident that the centre has the capacity and capability through its high quality leadership and effective long-term planning to sustain its successful development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park Mt Eden completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park Mt Eden will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>16 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
