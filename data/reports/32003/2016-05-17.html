</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre is a parent cooperative early childhood service operating under the umbrella of the Thames Valley Coromandel Playcentre Association (TVCPA) and affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation. The centre is licensed to cater for 30 children including up to 10 children under two years of age. Currently there is one session per week that caters for seven children. The centre is located on spacious, attractive and well-maintained grounds in a rural setting adjacent to Mangatangi School. Playcentre families maintain supportive and reciprocal relationships with the school and local community.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report a new president took up her position at the end of 2015. There have been significant changes to membership and a drop in roll numbers. Centre members have made good progress in addressing the areas for development related to providing further opportunities for children to direct their own learning, sustain and extend their interests and experience a programme that recognises and responds to their language, culture and identity.</p><p>Since 2013 TVCPA has undergone a complete restructuring. It has employed key personal to undertake the day-to-day management of the association and centres. This change has allowed the governance board to plan more strategically, effectively manage their finances, property, personnel and health and safety requirements. There are 13 centres in the association covering a wide geographical area, which presents challenges for both the governance/management body and individual centres.¬†</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to encourage children to be active, respectful, confident, creative problem solvers, learning in a stimulating, friendly and supportive environment.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association provide effective and responsive governance and management for the centre. The philosophy is highly evident and enacted in the life of the centre. Centre members are dedicated to ongoing training and maintaining a valuable service where families and children can learn alongside one another.</p><p>Children demonstrate high levels of confidence and belonging as they explore the interesting areas of play provided. The environment provides children with easy access to a wide variety of plentiful, and high quality equipment and materials. Older children make decisions about how they will use these resources to enhance their play and creativity. Children enjoy playing both independently, in small groups and sharing together at planned and spontaneous whole-group times. Their understanding of their role as caretakers of the living world is enhanced by learning alongside adults in the centre gardens, planting fruit trees and engaging in other sustainable practices such as harvesting and sharing food together. Younger children work cooperatively alongside older children and siblings, and enjoy opportunities to observe and join in play with them. Infants benefit from maintaining familiar routines with their mothers and quiet spaces for breastfeeding and sleeping.</p><p>Adults plan trips and excursions to places of interest in the wider community to extend and enhance children's learning about the wider world.</p><p>Aspects of MƒÅori culture are valued and recognised in the environment and programme. Children are developing their skills with poi and rakau and enjoy sharing waiata with adults at mat times. Individual pepeha are displayed and there is good inclusion of the diverse cultures of all families in the programme.</p><p>Adults plan and implement a programme that contributes to children developing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curiosity and love of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership and social skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confidence in their physical ability to manage challenge and risk taking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ability to be involved in projects over time and add complexity to their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The programme is clearly linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, documented and evaluated at regular meetings. Individual profile books and attractive centre displays enable children and families to revisit and share their learning and successes together.</p><p>Adults consistently make good use of their detailed knowledge of children's strengths, interests and life at home to provide a relevant and meaningful programme. They use open-ended questions to invite children's ideas and opinions. Children's oral language is enriched by the conversations they have with interested adults. Calm, respectful and unhurried interactions are a strength of the centre and a positive outcome of learning gained from ongoing training and course work.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-planned and reciprocal process as they successfully make the transition to the adjacent primary school. Parents report that children are well prepared for ongoing learning in the school environment.</p><p>Centre members are enthusiastic, work cooperatively and foster emergent leadership amongst newer members in a welcoming and inclusive environment. There is a good understanding of succession planning for centre roles and responsibilities and this contributes to centre sustainability. Centre members have worked effectively to strengthen annual planning and self review. This is resulting in ongoing centre development and improvement.</p><p>A particular strength of the centre is the ongoing mentoring, support and guidance from a dedicated and experienced liaison officer. She visits the centre regularly, is available for advice and information sharing, and provides members with documented and relevant feedback. This support is highly valued by members.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It is now important for adults to seek support from P≈´riri Whakamaru o Hauraki to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further support children and adults to learn about the history of local hap≈´ and iwi through meaningful experiences and stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase adults' knowledge of te reo and include this in meaningful contexts during sessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build the confidence and competence of centre members to provide a programme that reflects the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre members are dedicated to continue to find ways to promote their centre in the local community with a view to increasing their membership to ensure the future viability of the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>17 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to¬†</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
