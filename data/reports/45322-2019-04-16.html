</table><p><span>Wymondley Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wymondley Early Learning Centre is one of two preschool services located on the grounds of Wymondley School, Otara. The centre is adjacent to the local kohanga reo. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 10 aged under two years. The roll includes a small group of MƒÅori, and two-thirds of the children enrolled have Pacific heritage.</p><p>The service's philosophy recognises the values and knowledge each child brings from their own life experiences. It identifies a strong commitment to fostering an interactive, fun environment where children can learn positively. The philosophy also acknowledges the integral role family and whƒÅnau play in furthering children's learning.</p><p>A board of trustees, consisting of local community members, governs the centre. The board is committed to providing children with good quality early childhood education. The supervisor is responsible for day-to-day operations.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report, several new teachers have been appointed. Most teachers are qualified. The report recommended that teachers access external support to help them strengthen self-review, programme planning and appraisal processes. Teachers continue to make progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the centre where their identity, language and culture are affirmed. They are warmly greeted on arrival and have positive relationships with teachers and each other. Children engage in play that interests them, communicate respectfully with each other, and develop social skills as they play cooperatively together. They confidently make choices from prepared activities and available resources. Older children develop tuakana/teina relationships with their younger peers and model independent learning.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years, benefit from a calm and peaceful environment with caring teachers. Education and care routines are appropriately individualised. Younger children have easy access to the outside area for exploration and play with the older children. Leaders could review the resources in the learning space for infants, to promote increased opportunities for exploration and investigation.</p><p>Children make full use of the learning environment. The outside play area is spacious and attractive. It offers a good range of interesting challenges to help develop children's physical skills and social competencies. The indoor area has some inviting spaces and displays that reflect the character of the centre.</p><p>Children are settled and well cared for by teachers who know them and their families well. Children hear te reo MƒÅori and other home languages spoken by teachers and others. Teachers celebrate important cultural events with families, and the environment reflects children's cultures. Regular gatherings provide opportunities for children to sing, dance and celebrate together in different languages and cultures.</p><p>Teachers respond to children's individual interests. They are sensitive and responsive to children with additional learning needs. Adults' conversations with children encourage them to share their ideas. They support children to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in different contexts. Children trust teachers to be responsive and to encourage them in their learning. When needed, teachers make timely interventions to refocus children's interests and guide purposeful play.</p><p>Teachers plan activities from observing children's emerging interests. While this approach helps teachers to provide activities that reflect these interests, it does not yet identify specific teaching strategies or learning goals to extend children's learning. Teachers would benefit from support to strengthen their understanding of their role in extending children's learning, and supporting older children to develop their critical thinking skills.</p><p>With support from the new entrant teacher at the adjacent primary school, leaders are reviewing the transition to school programmes, with a clear focus on play-based learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Teachers' different strengths are valued and responsibilities are shared. They use the strategic action plan well to guide centre operations, and achieve goals that align with the board's expectations. Internal evaluation has been identified by leaders as an area to continue developing. The newly introduced appraisal system supports teachers to inquire into their own practice. Leaders are aware that deeper reflection and a more in-depth response to children's learning would enhance teaching practice, and contribute to improving positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using the centre's vision to clearly identify strategic goals for the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a set of indicators to define what quality teaching practice should look like at this centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the consistency of planning, assessment and evaluation, so teachers clearly plan how they can support and extend children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wymondley Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>16 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
