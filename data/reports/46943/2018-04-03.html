</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kea Kids, Russell Road opened in April 2016. This is the first ERO evaluation of the service.</p><p>Kea Kids Russell Road is one of five centres owned and privately operated by Ferns Education Limited. Licensed for 72 children including 15 children aged under 2 years, the centre provides full day learning programmes in a purpose built facility. Three separate rooms cater for different age groups. The community attending the centre is predominately Māori, Samoan and Indian, with smaller numbers of children from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The Kea Kids philosophy and vision guide all practices and developments at the centre. The philosophy indicates a commitment to creating a quality home-like environment, where whānau and community involvement in the curriculum and children's learning is encouraged and valued. Māori and Pacific perspectives and languages are incorporated and the service is committed to promoting the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Meeting the needs of a diverse and multicultural community is another focus of the philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play in spacious and very well resourced indoor and outdoor learning areas. Children enjoy good access to a wide range of equipment and have many opportunities to make choices about their play. Teachers engage in caring interactions that promote children's wellbeing and foster their sense of belonging. Children are very settled and comfortable in the centre environment and play well alongside each other.</p><p>Children benefit socially from periods of mixed age group play, and opportunities for tuakana/teina learning. Routines allow children time to sustain their interest in activities and to move freely between age appropriate indoor and outdoor learning spaces.</p><p>Teachers are attentive and responsive to the needs and preferences of children aged under two years. Children experience respectful nurturing care from teachers, and from personalised routines that align to their whānau routines at home.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are effectively building trust and learning partnerships with parents and whānau. The knowledge and skills that parents and whānau bring to the centre are valued. Leaders and teachers are committed to finding ways for families to contribute to learning programmes and to share their language and culture.</p><p>Bicultural practices are a strong feature of the centre. Te reo Māori is woven through the programme, and children's language, culture and identity are recognised, celebrated and incorporated within the centre's routines and curriculum.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre, and on to school are well managed and based on children's individual needs. Children and their whānau benefit from unhurried and well planned transitions between rooms, and from relationships that teachers are developing with two local primary schools.</p><p>In 2017 the centre experienced a number of leadership and staffing challenges. Governance and leadership structures within Kea Kids supported this period of change well. In January 2018 a new centre manager and new room leaders were appointed. Internal and external support structures are in place to further grow leadership capacity centre wide.</p><p>The teaching team is developing well and working collaboratively. Good professional relationships are evident. Centre leaders have identified strengthening and documenting planning and assessment procedures as next areas for development. They are currently rebuilding and refreshing these practices. This curriculum work is timely and should assist teachers to achieve greater consistency with planning, recording children's learning stories in portfolios, and with in-depth evaluation of the learning programme.</p><p>The centre has a useful and documented process for internal review and evaluation. This should assist leaders to develop high quality programmes and improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>New Kea Kids procedures for performance management and teacher appraisal have recently been introduced. The centre has identified the need to continue to provide appropriate ongoing professional learning programmes for teachers as this new system becomes embedded in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>refining the annual plan to better reflect the key goals for each year</li>
<li>continuing to build leadership capability by providing ongoing support and professional learning for leaders</li>
<li>refreshing and refining planning and assessment systems to promote consistency in teacher practice</li>
<li>continuing to provide relevant support to embed recently introduced teacher appraisal processes.   </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kea Kids Childcare Russell Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kea Kids Childcare Russell Road will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>3 April 2018<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
