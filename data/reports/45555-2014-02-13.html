</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Waipuna Ariki O Matangireia is located in the rohe of NgƒÅti Awa. It is situated on the Te Tohu O Te Ora O NgƒÅti Awa complex, just out of Whakatane, on whenua of historical significance to NgƒÅti Awa. The centre was established in 2010 by NgƒÅti Awa Health and Social Services trust to give all whƒÅnau in the rohe the opportunity to send their tamariki to a bilingual early childhood centre that values NgƒÅti Awatanga.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for 59 tamariki, including 10 from birth to two years of age. All tamariki at the centre are MƒÅori. The majority of tamariki are of NgƒÅti Awa descent, and the remaining children are affiliated to other iwi.</p><p>Trust and centre managers are very responsive to the diverse needs of tamariki, whƒÅnau and the local community. They demonstrate a strong commitment to equity and removing barriers to participation in early childhood education. The provision of transport to and from the centre has significantly increased opportunities for local tamariki to receive early childhood education.</p><p>The general manager of the trust has overall responsibility for the centre. The new education services manager (ESM) took over the management and educational leadership of the centre three months prior to this ERO review. The teaching team has participated in whole centre professional development on assessment. NgƒÅ kaimahi ako ( teaching staff) include six kaiako who are qualified early childhood teachers and three support staff.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy affirms that it is founded in NgƒÅti Awatanga and MƒÅoritanga, underpinned by MƒÅori values and celebration of cultural identity and diversity. It aims to prepare tamariki by giving them a love of learning and supporting them to be persistent, resilient and to show awhi, manaaki and aroha to all. The centre values literacy and mathematical learning. It also aims to empower whƒÅnau to make informed decisions about education for their tamariki.</p><p>This is Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia‚Äôs first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki experience close and trusting relationships with adults and other children. These positive relationships nurture the wairua and emotional wellbeing of tamariki. As a result tamariki settle well and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They play cooperatively, awhi and show aroha for their peers.</p><p>Pƒìpi and young toddlers experience a calm, respectful and loving environment. Kaimahi ako work in partnership with whƒÅnau to establish individual care routines for pƒìpi, and to meet their changing needs. Consistent caregiving allows pƒìpi and young toddlers to form strong and secure attachments with familiar adults. Kaimahi ako provide high-quality support for language development in te reo MƒÅori and English.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy, including manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, NgƒÅti Awatanga and MƒÅoritanga, is effectively implemented. Strengths of the programme include ongoing opportunities for tamariki to:</p><ul>
<li>experience success as MƒÅori in an environment that strongly values and affirms their cultural identity</li>
<li>listen to high quality use of te reo MƒÅori modelled by a significant number of kaimahi ako. As a result tamariki are very comfortable with the use of te reo, respond well to instructions, recite karakia, perform haka, sing waiata and himene, and often incorporate MƒÅori words in their conversations</li>
<li>experience kawa, tikanga and te reo MƒÅori in authentic and meaningful contexts such as p≈çwhiri, hui and tangihanga. This fosters their ability to operate confidently and competently in MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ contexts</li>
<li>learn about NgƒÅti Awatanga through haka, waiata, pepeha, and lively re-enactments of p≈´rƒÅkau (stories about ancestors)</li>
<li>explore mathematical and literacy concepts.</li>
</ul><p>Tamariki with identified learning needs are also well supported and included positively in the programme.</p><p>The ESM has significantly improved the quality and frequency of communication with whƒÅnau about their tamariki. WhƒÅnau find staff to be friendly, welcoming and approachable. A stronger focus on documenting the interests and learning of individual tamariki would make portfolios for older tamariki more meaningful for parents, and assist kaimahi ako to plan for emerging interests.</p><p>The ESM is providing clear and effective professional leadership. She is a strong advocate for tamariki and whƒÅnau and has made good progress in:</p><ul>
<li>developing a more reflective teaching team</li>
<li>building teaching practice through modelling, mentoring and coaching, and promoting a shared teaching philosophy</li>
<li>developing a more collaborative approach to centre decision making and self review.</li>
</ul><p>She is currently developing a more robust system of staff appraisal.</p><p>Centre management, staff, whƒÅnau and tamariki benefit greatly from the manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and wrap around support provided by Te Tohu o Te Ora o NgƒÅti Awa. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>its vision and commitment to adhere to MƒÅori kawa (values)</li>
<li>modelling and sharing of expertise in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and NgƒÅti Awatanga</li>
<li>property and human resource management</li>
<li>provision of a wide range of education, health, social and support services, including targeted whƒÅnau education programmes</li>
<li>the centre‚Äôs building and premises and the use of trust facilities.</li>
</ul><p>The ESM keeps the general manager and trust well informed about the quality of education and outcomes for tamariki and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agreed with the general manager and ESM that their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategic and annual action plans for centre improvement</li>
<li>align these plans with self review, appraisal and professional development priorities, and budget allocations accordingly</li>
<li>develop clear procedures for self review to assist kaimahi ako to further evaluate and improve the quality of education, including the learning environment and assessment practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>13 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
