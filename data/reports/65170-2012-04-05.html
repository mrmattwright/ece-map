<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Picton Preschool is a privately owned and run early childhood centre that caters for children up to the age of five. Two directors share the ownership and management of the service, one acting as licensee. The directors have a strong commitment to the community, evident through their relationships with whƒÅnau and involvement with the wider community.</p>
<p>Since the November 2008 ERO report teachers have undertaken professional development on assessment and have introduced learning stories to children‚Äôs portfolio books. These are records of children‚Äôs participation in the preschool programme and include useful anecdotal notes that capture children‚Äôs interests each month.</p>
<p>The programme supports literacy and mathematics development. Exploration, inquiry and problem solving are also evident. Teachers questioning techniques extend children‚Äôs play and promote learning discussions. Te reo MƒÅori is appropriately incorporated in aspects of the programme and environment. Mat times are well used to develop children‚Äôs participation and independence.</p>
<p>Children relate well and are caring towards each other. They cooperate and understand how to take turns. Teachers are warm, positive and enthusiastic in their conversations with children and invite participation in the range of preschool activities. Children are confident and curious about the world around them.</p>
<p>The centre is attractively presented and maintained. Learning areas are well resourced with a range of choices available to children. The variety of equipment promotes challenge and fosters physical development and skills. The centre is set up to provide teachers and children with good visibility of areas throughout the day.</p>
<p>While some progress has been made addressing the recommendations from the 2008 ERO report, in-depth work is still needed on self review, particularly assessment, planning and evaluation, and appraisal.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<p>Before the review, the management of Picton Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Picton Preschool.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2006 and 2008 ERO reports found Picton Preschool provided a warm, welcoming environment, with positive interactions between staff and children. Both reports stated that self review, programme evaluation and performance appraisal needed development.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<h5>Curriculum Implementation/Programme</h5>
<p>Since the previous ERO review teachers have undertaken professional development on assessment and have introduced learning stories to children‚Äôs portfolio books. These are records of children‚Äôs participation in the preschool programme, supplemented with artwork. Portfolios also include useful anecdotal notes that capture children‚Äôs interests each month. Notebooks are used to supplement the information provided to families and for parents to communicate key information about their children.</p>
<p>The programme¬†supports literacy and mathematics development. Exploration, inquiry and problem solving are also evident. Questioning techniques extend children‚Äôs play and promote learning discussions. Te reo MƒÅori is appropriately incorporated in aspects of the programme and environment. Mat times are well used to develop children‚Äôs participation, contribution and independence.</p>
<h5>Interactions</h5>
<p>Children relate well to each other. They are caring and are encouraged to negotiate, play respectfully and understand how to take turns. Teachers are warm, positive and enthusiastic in their conversations with children and invite participation in the range of preschool activities. Children are confident in their exchanges with adults and demonstrate curiosity about the world around them.</p>
<h5>Environment</h5>
<p>The centre is attractively presented and maintained. All learning areas are well resourced with a range of choices readily available to children. The variety of equipment promotes challenge and fosters physical development and skills. The centre is set up to provide teachers and children with good visibility of areas throughout the day.</p>
<h5>Self Review</h5>
<p>A framework for self review has been developed to review areas identified for improvement.</p>
<p>Good self-review practices include a three-year review cycle of policy and procedures, with parents invited to contribute their views as part of the process. Questionnaires are used appropriately to gather information from both teachers and parents.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<h5>Self review</h5>
<p>Self review requires strengthening. Including clearly stated indicators of quality against which information can be evaluated and progress measured, and how the gathered information is used to inform future actions, is likely to contribute to improve outcomes for children.</p>
<p>The strategic plan has the potential to inform self review. It could be strengthened by identifying actions, areas of responsibility and indicators of success.</p>
<h5>Appraisal</h5>
<p>The appraisal system lacks rigour and sufficient structure. Providing feedback to teachers about the quality of their teaching practice should inform subsequent professional development focuses and impact positively on teachers‚Äô ability to develop child-led learning.</p>
<h5>Programme</h5>
<p>The preschool philosophy states that the preschool supports child-initiated and adultled learning. While teachers are gathering information about children‚Äôs emerging interests, it is not clear how this informs programme planning. Teachers need to make explicit the links between the interests that they observe children initiating and how they develop the programme in response.</p>
<p>There are no records of planning meetings where children‚Äôs needs and interests are discussed nor is there evidence of programme evaluation to show how teachers reflect on the success of the activities they provide in their weekly plans. A high level of teacher direction is evident in the programme.</p>
<p>Assessments in learning stories show how teachers notice and recognise children‚Äôs learning. While next steps are included they are often general statements of support. Teachers do not always identify specific strategies to extend learning.</p>
<p>Children need to ask an adult in order to access their profiles. These should be placed at child level to increase opportunities to revisit prior learning.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Picton Preschool completed an ERO <em>Centre Management Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p>
<ul><li>include the location of incidents in records of accidents to support analysis¬†<em>[strengthen the appraisal process to provide regular guidance and support for teachers that links to professional development].</em></li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p>
<div><ol><li>
<p>management, in consultation with staff, will develop a comprehensive action plan, that outlines how the areas for development and review outlined in this report will be addressed and progress sustained.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office‚Äôs latest report on Picton Preschool.</p>
<p>Picton Preschool is a privately owned and run early childhood centre that caters for children up to the age of five. Two directors share the ownership and management of the service, one acting as licensee. The directors have a strong commitment to the community, evident through their relationships with whƒÅnau and involvement with the wider community.</p>
<p>Since the November 2008 ERO report teachers have undertaken professional development on assessment and have introduced learning stories to children‚Äôs portfolio books. These are records of children‚Äôs participation in the preschool programme and include useful anecdotal notes that capture children‚Äôs interests each month.</p>
<p>The programme supports literacy and mathematics development. Exploration, inquiry and problem solving are also evident. Teachers questioning techniques extend children‚Äôs play and promote learning discussions. Te reo MƒÅori is appropriately incorporated in aspects of the programme and environment. Mat times are well used to develop children‚Äôs participation and independence.</p>
<p>Children relate well and are caring towards each other. They cooperate and understand how to take turns. Teachers are warm, positive and enthusiastic in their conversations with children and invite participation in the range of preschool activities. Children are confident and curious about the world around them.</p>
<p>The centre is attractively presented and maintained. Learning areas are well resourced with a range of choices available to children. The variety of equipment promotes challenge and fosters physical development and skills. The centre is set up to provide teachers and children with good visibility of areas throughout the day.</p>
<p>While some progress has been made addressing the recommendations from the 2008 ERO report, in-depth work is still needed on self review, particularly assessment, planning and evaluation, and appraisal.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre‚Äôs self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO‚Äôs framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> ‚Äì including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> ‚Äì other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> ‚Äì assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
