<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>This centre continues to be well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Maihiihi Playcentre is a parent-led centre located in a rural community near Otorohanga. It operates under the umbrella of King Country Playcentre Association to provide education and care for children from birth to school age. Centre members receive ongoing support and advice from a Centre Support staff member employed by the association. At the time of the review, 27 children were enrolled. Parents were providing two morning sessions each week, one for all age groups and a Big Kids session for older children. The centre has a well-established relationship with the nearby Maihiihi School. Previous ERO reports indicate that children attending the playcentre have benefited from positive, trusting and responsive relationships in a well-prepared learning environment.</p><p>Centre members have been involved in professional development to expand their knowledge of up-to-date planning, assessment and self-review processes. They have attended professional development about strategies to recognise and affirm children&rsquo;s culture and identity, including a focus on M&#257;ori. An association kaiawhina assisted the centre to include aspects of Maori language and culture in the curriculum.</p><p>Recent improvements to the environment include a deck that provides sheltered play space, a child-friendly cooking area, easy access to an area planted in native trees, and the establishment of fruit and vegetable gardens.</p><p>The centre philosophy reflects national playcentre philosophy. High value is placed on adults and children learning from each other during child-initiated play. Parent members provide an atmosphere that is welcoming and inclusive for families of all cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in ten early childhood education services within the King Country Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly involved in self-initiated activities in a positive welcoming environment. Older children participate in sustained, group imaginative play and exploration. Babies and toddlers have a protected area where they can safely investigate equipment that supports their learning and development. Children select from well-presented and resourced areas of play that promote creativity, enjoyment of books and stories, and mathematical experiences. A feature of the centre is children&rsquo;s involvement in following recipes to prepare food for baking. The outdoor environment is extensive, attractively presented and well-maintained. It stimulates a high level of challenging physically active play and provides a range of opportunities for parents to work alongside their children.</p><p>Parents take responsibility for educating their children. They share and support play and communication through two-way conversations and questions. Their interactions with children are responsive, nurturing and extend their knowledge and understanding. A Big Kids session, led by an experienced supervisor, allows children to attend without being accompanied by their parent or caregiver. These older children also visit the local school&rsquo;s junior class.</p><p>The centre programme is planned to take account of children&rsquo;s interests, and includes activities and excursions to enrich children&rsquo;s experiences. Parents record children&rsquo;s learning and development through photographs and learning stories, which are displayed in the centre and in children&rsquo;s individual portfolios. Experienced members provide a good model of how adults can notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>ERO and centre members agree that the next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>record and share more specific examples of children&rsquo;s interests in daily session evaluations</li>
<li>follow up children&rsquo;s currently emerging interests at the next session or at home.</li>
</ul><p>Parents have worked hard to increase the use of te reo M&#257;ori and are including M&#257;ori legends in the learning programme. Their goal is to continue this important focus, so that parents and children become more confident in understanding and using M&#257;ori language and learning in everyday situations.</p><p>Experienced association and centre personnel maintain effective and well-informed management and leadership. Centre members work well together to implement playcentre philosophy. They develop agreed strategic goals, and use well-planned, reflective self review to set priorities for improvement. A strategic goal is to support sustainability. Centre leaders are contributing to this goal by encouraging and supporting newer members to take on management and education responsibilities, and to undertake playcentre training. Many parents appreciate the benefits of playcentre training and are reaching higher course levels.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maihiihi Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Recommendations to other agencies</h3><p>Not applicable.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
