</table><p>The February 2015 ERO report found that Eastland Educare was not well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Key systems and practices were at an early stage of development. Consequently, staff had made limited progress in improving the centre curriculum and the quality of teaching. Additionally there was a need to progress the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving assessment, planning and evaluation practices to include extending the complexity of children‚Äôs learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre philosophy to further strengthen the quality of the programme for children, particularly for infants and toddlers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eastland Educare is a privately owned and family managed early childhood centre in Gisborne. It provides all day education and care for up to 33 children, including eight up to the age of two. Sixteen children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The teaching team comprises seven qualified teachers, including four who are provisionally registered. Two staff are in training. There have been changes to staffing since the previous ERO review.</p><p>Following the February 2015 ERO report, leaders and teachers received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Further professional learning and development has been sought by the centre in strengthening leadership. Progress and ongoing improvement is evident. Continuing to strengthen staff understanding of expectations and increased monitoring by leaders should support improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy has been reviewed in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau. Useful indicators of quality have been developed for teachers with a focus on the particular age group of children they teach. These are beginning to guide the programme for children and teaching practice expectations.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children supporting and extending their interests. Nurturing relationships between adults are children are evident. Opportunities for exploration and collaborative play for infants, toddlers and young children are provided. Leaders have identified that further understanding and implementation of high quality practice for infants and toddlers is a priority. ERO agrees. This evaluation also identified that teachers need to focus on using rich oral language when facilitating children's learning to support their language development.</p><p>Children's interests informs group planning that is inclusive of the local community and enriches the programme. Clearly defining the learning objectives and formally evaluating these is a next step.</p><p>Teachers' understanding of the purpose and use of assessment for learning remains an area for ongoing development. Narratives describe children's emerging interests, opportunities and experiences. Children experience challenge in their play and learning, however, this is not yet well reflected through assessment documentation. Purposeful connections between narratives should assist in identifying progression of learning over time and inform day-to-day learning experiences.</p><p>Children's portfolios reflect the developing learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. Collaborative goal setting is actively promoted to focus the child's learning. The expertise of teachers should be used to build consistently high quality practice throughout the centre.</p><p>Consideration of bicultural practice is reflected through planning. Teachers are committed to ongoing improvements in bicultural practice and actively engage in ongoing learning. Leaders agree they need to extend their knowledge and understanding of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific learners centre wide.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported through a collaborative approach. External agencies, parents, whƒÅnau and teaching staff collaborate on strategies and goals to support their development.</p><p>Key systems to guide centre operation and practices have been established and are regularly reviewed. This includes staff appointments, guidelines for staff release and health and safety practices. Expectations and responsibilities to fully enact the policies should now be developed. This includes strengthening premise checks to ensure all reasonable precautions are taken to prevent accidents.</p><p>Further developing staff appraisal remains a priority. The following areas should be strengthened to ensure this process supports improvement and effective teaching practice:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing and refining the appraisal policy and process to align with the requirements of the Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently and rigorously following expected practice, including observations of practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual appraisal of all staff, including centre leaders.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The newly established process for the induction and mentoring of provisionally certificated teachers is not yet enacted consistently. Clearly identifying the roles and responsibilities for the people involved is urgent. Formalising this mentoring process should better support developing teachers.</p><p>Leaders are participating in ongoing professional learning and development to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of effective leadership. For ongoing improvements to centre operation and curriculum implementation, it is now timely to develop understanding and use of effective review and evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop, implement and monitor clearly defined expectations for centre operation, with a particular emphasis on improving practice over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop understanding and implementation of high quality practices for assessment for learning and the programme for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a robust appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalise the induction and mentoring programme for provisionally certificated teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build understanding and use of effective review and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eastland Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to appraisal. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure all staff are annually appraised. <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Eastland Educare will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>10 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
