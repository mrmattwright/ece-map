</table><p>Annabel's Private Kindergarten¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Annabel's Private Kindergarten is one of eight early learning services within Annabel's Educare Ltd. An area manager oversees the eight centres and is supported in her work by the owner/director. Both the area manager and owner are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Annabel's Private Kindergarten is licensed for 36 children and caters specifically for four year olds. The centre is one of three adjacent Annabel services in Darfield.</p><p>Children progress through each centre into Annabel's Private Kindergarten, which is open from 9.00am to 3.00pm. On a day-to-day basis many children stay longer by beginning and/or finishing their day in Annabel's Educare centre while spending the majority of their day is the kindergarten.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, a new centre manager has been appointed. All of the teachers are qualified, early childhood teachers. The kindergarten is part of the Malvern KƒÅhui Ako | Community of Learning.</p><p>Annabel's Private Kindergarten continues to be a high performing service and has made very good progress against ERO's 2014 recommendations.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews of Darfield kindergartens within Annabel's Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from very caring, responsive and respectful relationships. They play well alongside and with each other, and show a strong sense of belonging. Children have many opportunities to initiate and lead their learning, and be leaders in supporting other children with their learning. They play and learn in spacious, thoughtfully presented and well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>The programme is specifically designed to meet the needs, interests and strengths of four year old children. Children experience a broad curriculum, with a strong focus on early literacy, mathematics, dramatic play, art and physical activity. A recent initiative using storytelling is further enhancing children's oral language. There is also a strong focus on social competence and emotional wellbeing. Children are very well supported in their transition into the centre and on to school.</p><p>Since the introduction of Te Whariki 2017 (the early childhood curriculum) teachers are placing greater emphasis on children's learning and the strategies they use to support this. They have developed very effective planning, assessment and evaluation processes for individual and group learning. Teachers seek and value parents' contributions to these processes and their involvement in supporting their child's learning.</p><p>Cultural diversity is valued, with te ao and te reo MƒÅori given prominence. Core MƒÅori values, such as manaakitanga (kindness), kaitiakitanga (care for the environment) and whanaungatanga (the importance of relationships), are very evident in the programme and centre environment. Cultures of children and their families from beyond New Zealand are celebrated.</p><p>Centre and service leaders are very reflective and improved focused. Effective internal evaluation practices are well embedded, including evaluating the effectiveness of teaching strategies and different curriculum areas in supporting children's learning. Children's and parents' voice are integral to evaluation practice. Internal evaluation contributes strongly to well-informed change and ongoing development.</p><p>Strong governance and management practices contribute to high quality provision for children and their families. Centre processes, such as relevant professional learning and development (PLD) and robust appraisal practices, align closely with the service's well-considered strategic goals and planning. There is a sound policy and procedure framework and well-developed resources to support consistency of practice within and across the three centres.</p><p>Leaders have a deliberate focus on equity for all learners. This is evident in targeted budgeting for personnel and resources for identified children. Children with additional needs are very well supported in their learning.</p><p>Leaders have built positive relationships and partnerships in order to best support children's learning. Leaders and staff work very collaboratively to achieve strategic and centre priorities. Teachers' strengths are valued and leadership fostered and distributed. Involvement in the Malvern KƒÅhui Ako is benefitting teachers and children, through shared PLD and professional conversations.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>The service leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, the need to review their curriculum in relation to Te WhƒÅriki 2017. This review will include defining the learning that matters most/learning priorities at the service. Subsequent internal evaluation processes should evaluate how well the curriculum promotes these identified learning priorities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Annabel's Private Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>11 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
