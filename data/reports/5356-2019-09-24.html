</table><p>Khandallah Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Khandallah Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 42 children, aged over two years. The current roll of 74 children, includes five MƒÅori children. The service provides whƒÅnau sessions where siblings can attend together.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of a rich curriculum where all children are respected and encouraged to explore and be challenged within a stimulating and inclusive environment.</p><p>A range of new and long term staff make up the fully qualified teaching and leadership team.</p><p>Khandallah Kindergarten is governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association (the association). The chief executive and a board of trustees are responsible for the governance. A team of senior teachers oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The association governs 102 kindergartens which includes three Pacific kindergartens and a Pacific home-based service with two networks.</p><p>The June ERO 2015 report identified areas requiring development including assessment of individual children‚Äôs learning and the use of self-review to evaluate the programme. Good progress has been made.</p><p>Progress has been made by the association to improve the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p><p>This review was one of nine in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teaching and learning practices reflect the adopted philosophical values and promotes positive outcomes. There are respectful relationships within this community of learners. Children, whƒÅnau and teachers value and care for the service and actively contribute to the growth and wellbeing of all. The well maintained environment is organised to extend and stimulate children‚Äôs unique self-determined identity.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive facilitators of authentic opportunities for children to learn. They invite interests, extend ideas and integrate literacy and numeracy in a variety of fun ways. Extensive resources are easily accessed and promote child-led learning experiences. Teachers uphold mana through acceptance and valuing of children's individual uniqueness. Positive guidance is used well to support social competence development.</p><p>Regular opportunities for children to experience, understand and engage in te ao MƒÅori are clearly evident. Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the diversity of Aotearoa are respected and acknowledged through cultural events, daily routines, learning stories and well-considered transitions for families and children into the kindergarten and to school.</p><p>Children with additional learning and care needs are identified and support agencies are involved as required.</p><p>An effective planning for learning framework guides teacher practice and is based on children‚Äôs emerging interests. Well-considered group planning identifies an extensive range of useful teaching and learning activities and is further evidence of a rich curriculum. This includes a range of events, routines and traditions that connect children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>WhƒÅnau voice is valued and regularly informs the teaching and learning programmes. Children's assessment portfolios show progress. There is some clear evidence of children being extended through engaging in more complex opportunities to learn. This is particularly evident in transition to school, an example of good practice aligned to the associations expectations.</p><p>To further strengthen their approach to assessment teachers should continue to clearly record in portfolios the impact of intentional teaching on outcomes for children. This should better inform next teaching and learning steps.</p><p>An appropriate internal evaluation framework is in place. Leaders and teachers have used this to strengthen their approach. The teaching team should continue to build a shared understanding and capability of this process to clearly identify valued outcomes for children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The teaching team is well led. A highly collaborative, improvement focused culture is in place. Teacher strengths are valued and extended. Shared understanding supports the seamless enactment of the kindergarten community's and association's expectations.</p><p>A well-considered appraisal process has recently been enhanced to grow and develop teacher practice. Teachers are expected to inquire into the effectiveness of their teaching. Purposeful appraisal goals focus on improving aspects of leadership and practice to support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. They successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility to implement the vision, values and mission of the association. Systems and processes have been well developed to guide teacher‚Äôs capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Senior leaders work effectively together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Well-considered resource allocation supports and enhances children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the teaching team's self-identified areas for development to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen assessment documentation to clearly align with the associations expectations outlined in Te Manawa</li>
<li>build shared understanding of and capability in using internal evaluation as a tool for improvement.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and senior leaders agree that the association's next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to follow the strategic direction set through T≈´manako, Te Tiriti o Waitangi based Strategic Priority Framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Khandallah Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>24 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
