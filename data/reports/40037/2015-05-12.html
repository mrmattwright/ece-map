</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taupo Playcentre is a family cooperative, early childhood service where parents and children learn alongside one another. The centre is located in Taup≈ç and provides high quality, mixed-age, sessional education and care for children from birth to school age. It is licensed for 30 children, including 20 children under 2, at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, centre rolls were increasing and there were 58 children, including 6 children who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Rotorua Playcentre Association, which acts as its governing body. The association strongly endorses the playcentre philosophy, and aims to empower parents to be the first and best educators of their children. It expects that parents will act as volunteer leaders and managers for their playcentre. The association employs staff to provide centre parents with guidance and support. The knowledgeable operations manager is readily available to assist with information, and an experienced centre support officer attends playcentre sessions and meetings to advise and mentor members. The association receives reports from the centre support officer and the centre members who provide assurance of compliance with licensing, health and safety and other operational requirements.</p><p>Playcentres offer a recognised adult education qualification, designed to assist parents to provide appropriate learning opportunities for their children. The association offers training towards this qualification for all members. In addition, the association recently provided professional development through a Ministry of Education contract. An experienced tutor assisted the association and its centres to use self review to promote and evaluate the organisation‚Äôs strategic goals.</p><p>Through its strategic plan, the association provides a framework for centres to set their development goals. These relate to their Te Tiriti o Waitangi commitment, the vibrancy of their communities of learning, their recognition in the wider community, and their sustainable future.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy is highly evident and families are strongly committed to the concept of 'parents as first and best educators of their children.'</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Rotorua Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families/whƒÅnau have established caring and responsive relationships and interactions that contribute to a strong sense of belonging and well being. The aesthetically pleasing and well-designed environment invites children to explore and experiment with a wide variety of high quality materials and equipment. A recent and innovative development of the infant area is a result of highly effective self review that included appropriate research into learning environments for children under two years old. This area provides a safe, inclusive and interesting environment for infants. The park-like outdoor environment provides children with outstanding opportunities to build their confidence and experience physical challenge.</p><p>Children of mixed ages demonstrate well-developed social skills and confidence as they participate in meaningful work such as gardening and baking. Older children build their leadership capability as they support and include younger children and siblings in their play. Knowledgeable adults are unhurried and make good use of calm and positive strategies to guide children‚Äôs decisions and choices.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and concepts of natural science are woven holistically into play through use of equipment, conversations, singing and storytelling. Parents take time to listen to children‚Äôs ideas and use open questions and rich vocabulary to support children to develop their oral language along with thinking and problem solving skills. Aspects of MƒÅori culture are evident in the programme and environment and as whƒÅnau learn alongside their tamariki. Centre members agree there is a need to further build their knowledge of local MƒÅori history, discover the places of significance to local MƒÅori, and include these as an important part of the programme.</p><p>Parents are enthusiastic to plan a good quality programme that recognises and responds to children‚Äôs interests and ongoing development. Continuity of learning is enhanced because parents are the children‚Äôs educators. The skills and interests of parents enrich the programme as they share their knowledge of the wider world. Centre members have set a goal to make greater use of the local and wider community to extend children‚Äôs learning experiences. Attractive displays and individual assessment portfolios record aspects of children‚Äôs involvement and experiences in the programme and celebrate their successes.</p><p>Centre members are highly collaborative. They make effective use of self review to develop and improve centre equipment, materials and the environment. Appropriate policies and processes are in place to protect the privacy of children and their families. Each parent decides what information to display about their children. Centre sustainability is promoted by the ongoing commitment and dedication from experienced members to foster the emergent leadership and learning of all members.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and Taup≈ç Playcentre leaders agree that self-review processes could be further enhanced by making greater use of Ministry of Education tools and guidelines. Attention should be given to continuing to strengthen parents‚Äô understanding and knowledge of:</p><ul>
<li>planning and evaluating the curriculum</li>
<li>acknowledging tangata whenua and bicultural practices</li>
<li>recognising and valuing the language, culture and identity of each child.</li>
</ul><p>The association has agreed that recognising and celebrating the learning for both adults and children is an essential part of valuing the ‚ÄòPlaycentre experience‚Äô. Adding a goal to the association and centre strategic plans for identifying and building on programme successes would focus attention on the quality of learning opportunities and outcomes for children. To implement this goal, agreed indicators are needed to identify the effective teaching practices that build programme success. These should include interactions that foster children‚Äôs language development, and intentional teaching strategies to engage in, and extend, children‚Äôs learning. Consideration could be given to including responsibility for identifying and modelling quality teaching interactions, and providing feedback, as part of centre support visits.</p><p>Including references to Ministry of Education tools and guidelines would assist centres to further evaluate their programmes and identify areas for ongoing improvement.</p><p>For example:</p><ul>
<li>use the information related to Curriculum Criterion 5 to review and strengthen bicultural practice</li>
<li>use the information related to Curriculum Criterion 6 to consider how children‚Äôs language, culture and identity can be recognised and integrated into the curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taupo Family Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taupo Family Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>12 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
