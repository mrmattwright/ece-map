</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childspace Ngaio Preschool is a recently merged licence with Childspace Ngaio Two to Five and Childspace Ngaio Infants and Toddlers. It operates out of two villas that are located side by side. There are four distinctive areas for children designed for the age groups. The infants and toddlers spaces, the Rahui room for children aged two and three and the Tui room for children aged three to five. Children in these spaces often spend time together.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 61 children including 25 children up to the age of two. Staffing includes a centre manager and an assistant manager for each villa and 16 teachers. Each villa has its own cook who makes nutritious meals. The teaching team has had personnel changes since the February 2012 ERO reports as two separate licences.</p><p>This service is governed by the Childspace Institute (the Institute). This organisation offers the wider early childhood sector professional development, resources and equipment. The centre is serviced by the Childspace Workshop. It has a high commitment to maintaining 80% to 100% of qualified teachers and ongoing teacher education and professional development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews of Childspace Early Learning Centres under the Childspace Institute.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm, welcoming, highly respectful and responsive to children. They value care moments with children and use these to form positive relationships. Care moments with infants and toddlers are responsive to the needs of the child. Teaching practice reflects a high commitment to the knowledge of care for children. Relationships between teachers are based on respect and they value the relationships with parents and whānau. A strong commitment to the centre's philosophy is evident in practice.</p><p>Settling-in processes for infants and toddlers are highly responsive to the needs and routines of the child and their family. This supports teachers to establish good relationships with parents and the child. A review of the centre transition-to-school process is planned. Useful information continues to be collated for parents as their children approach the transition to school.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to lead within the centre and continuously contribute to the design of the programme and environment. Group times for children are appreciated as a way to be together. The use of the tuakana teina model to promote learning through peer interactions is valued by teachers and evident in practice. Teachers use a variety of strategies to encourage children to think, explore, problem-solve and question their learning. They foster children's language development well.</p><p>Rituals and rhythms are central to the programme and are consistently implemented, giving children a sense of security to predict what will happen next. The environment for infants and toddlers is calm and peaceful allowing them to lead their own learning. The areas for the older children encourage them to direct their own learning.</p><p>The outdoor space is purposeful and well designed. Children play an integral part in respecting this space and are supported to participate in a nature-based programme. There are many opportunities for children to explore the local community through planned outings and weekly forest walks.</p><p>Teachers have implemented practices that are reflective of te ao Māori concepts in a thoughtful and appropriate manner. This is identified as needing continued development to further strengthen the bicultural programme within the centre. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>Children's assessment information highlights their identity as successful learners. Profiles are evidence of children’s learning and development over time. Teachers work together to identify children’s strengths and interests. Formal six-monthly meetings with parents provide a time to discuss children’s overall development. Including parents' aspirations, as discussed at the meetings, in the child's portfolio would further show how parents' input informs planning. Parents have regular opportunities to respond to children’s assessments and they contribute to these by adding comments and stories through an online assessment tool.</p><p>Self review is well established. It is used by teachers to make changes to the environment where appropriate. Teachers participate in research which helps them to reflect on the quality of practice. A current focus on continuity of care should further assist transitions between the four learning spaces. Teachers should continue to focus of self review on how well they are doing things.</p><p>The principal, based at the Institute, is involved with the aspirations, learning programmes and developments within the centre and provides ongoing support to the teaching team. Leadership is a strength and well promoted. The appraisal system provides a clear process for staff. This is currently under review. There is a good quality of feedback from appraisers to promote growth in professional practices.</p><p>The Institute provides a high level of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust policies and procedures developed in consultation with teachers and parents</li>
<li>well-considered assessment and planning frameworks</li>
<li>clear processes and expectations for continuous review</li>
<li>professional learning and leadership opportunities for staff.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management plans clearly link to the Institute’s strategic plan. There is a focus on improvement through reflection, review and professional development. Many opportunities for teachers to further their education are provided.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and the principal have outlined in an action plan the priority areas for further development. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen the collaboration between the two villas by moving towards having one vision, strategic plan and philosophy</li>
<li>strengthen transition to school with a particular focus on strengthening relationships with schools</li>
<li>continue to develop and refine shared understandings with Māori whānau of success for Māori children as Māori, so that teachers can measure the effectiveness of their practice.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation affirms these priorities to further enhance teaching practice and outcomes for children and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childspace Ngaio Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childspace Ngaio Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>7 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
