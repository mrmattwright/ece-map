</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matangirau Kindergarten is in the grounds of Tiaho School in Wairoa. It opens from 8:30 am to 2:30 pm Monday to Thursday and 8:30 am to 12:45 pm on Friday. The service caters for up to 20 children aged from two to school age. Seventeen children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by whakawhanaungatanga.</p><p>This kindergarten was opened in 2017. This is its first ERO report. A head teacher oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. The teaching team of two have been together for almost two terms.</p><p>Matangirau Kindergarten is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association). Two senior teachers provide professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed-term contract to guide kindergartens' implementation of tikanga and kaupapa MƒÅori practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed. Parents know they have a place at the kindergarten. They stay and socialise with one another and join in the programme. A sense of friendship and community is apparent.</p><p>Children confidently engage in sustained play. They freely explore activities, resources and the environment. Opportunities for new learning are offered through the programme. Children are confident, settled and know each other well. Teachers actively promote language development. Older children have opportunities to take on leadership roles. Tuakana teina relationships are evident.</p><p>Teachers continue to refine the newly developed philosophy. Developing indicators of what teacher practice and valued outcomes for children look like, should further strengthen this.</p><p>Respectful relationships between teachers, children and whƒÅnau contribute to children's sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers actively seek ways to strengthen these to move towards learning partnerships. Children's transitions into the kindergarten are carefully considered.</p><p>Bicultural practice is integral to the curriculum and fosters children's understanding of te ao MƒÅori. Teachers are continuing to strengthen their cultural competence in supporting MƒÅori children to experience success as MƒÅori, and exploring ways to connect with place-based learning.</p><p>Teachers work together collaboratively and share responsibility for curriculum delivery. A recent review of the programme has resulted in positive changes to the environment and teaching practice in response to younger children's needs. Consideration of what good practice looks like for two year olds should further strengthen the programme.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation is currently under development. Plans for individual children are becoming established in consultation with whƒÅnau. This should contribute to a clearer picture of children's learning progressions over time.</p><p>Children's portfolios capture their participation and engagement in the programme. Teachers should consider further strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning and intentional teaching for individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how learning is progressed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connections to culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsiveness to parent aspirations and perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers' understanding of internal evaluation is in the early stages. The association has identified that developing a shared understanding and use of internal evaluation is a priority.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to develop their practice. There is a strong commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system, when fully implemented, should strengthen teacher inquiries into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty-based partnerships and acknowledging MƒÅori as tangata whenua.</p><p>ERO recognises that teachers are in a period of change in establishing a new kindergarten, team, children and whƒÅnau. Further support from the association is required to address the key areas identified for further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop indicators and demonstrate best practice in relation to the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning to inform and enhance the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the new appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matangirau Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure that the outdoor activity space is well drained, suitably surfaced and any tripping hazards are mitigated.</p><p><em>[Licensing Criteria Centre Based Services 2008 PF13]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matangirau Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>1 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
