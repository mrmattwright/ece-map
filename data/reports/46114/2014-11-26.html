</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>King‚Äôs School Early Learning Centre in Auckland opened in 2013. The centre caters exclusively for boys who will continue their learning in the King's School environment. Currently, 19 boys are on the centre roll.</p><p>The Headmaster of King‚Äôs School is the licensee and many of the centre‚Äôs policies and management structures come under the school‚Äôs systems. Regulations specific to the centre are administered by the Head Teacher of the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy is strongly influenced by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, with a focus on respect and values. The centre is led by an experienced Head Teacher, supported by qualified experienced teachers. They have formed a cohesive team approach to teaching and learning and are well positioned to progress the centre through its next stage of development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Boys enjoy their learning. They are articulate communicators, independent and self managing. They know how to interact appropriately with others, show care and concern, and play safely and inclusively. They have rich opportunities to learn new skills, knowledge, and ways of working and thinking. Older boys lead and support others with confidence.</p><p>The boys have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Teachers are caring and supportive. They are highly focused on encouraging the boys to make positive choices and to take great pride in their learning. Teachers listen attentively to the boys‚Äô ideas and extend their thinking through purposeful conversations and open-ended questions. King‚Äôs values of kindness, humour, generosity, courtesy and perseverance are evident in centre practices.</p><p>The programme provides a strong foundation to support boys‚Äô literacy and numeracy. Teachers provide opportunities for boys to read with adults and their peers and to experiment with writing as part of their play. The boys also learn early mathematical concepts in a broad range of contexts. They receive specialist teaching in music and physical education and have regular opportunities to become familiar with the wider school environment and resources.</p><p>Teachers know each boy well and plan meaningful learning experiences for them. They share records of boys‚Äô learning with parents. They communicate well with parents and incorporate aspirations for their children in programme planning. Teachers regularly reflect on their practice and are well placed to monitor and evaluate their own effectiveness in supporting the boys‚Äô learning and development.</p><p>Teachers recognise that they need to further develop their understanding of the importance of culture, language and identity in children‚Äôs learning. Development in this area should help all boys to appreciate the richness of New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage and to understand how well King‚Äôs values align with MƒÅori concepts. The Ministry of Education resource <em>TƒÅtaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>, would help teachers to focus and reflect on their practice.</p><p>Since the centre opened, teachers have worked hard to provide a learning environment especially designed for boys. Teaching and learning programmes, routines, and administrative requirements are well established.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Head Teacher has identified the importance of professional development for all teachers in the centre to remain up to date with research. Processes for teacher performance appraisal are yet to be fully implemented and continue as a work in progress. Supporting good practices with strategic planning and effective self review are important next steps for centre development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of King's School - Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of King's School - Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
