</table><p>Active Explorers Greenmeadows requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Systems and processes to identify good practice and promote consistency of implementation across the centre have not yet been developed. Significant and ongoing changes at this service have impacted on progress in addressing the priorities for improvement identified in the February 2016 ERO report.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers Greenmeadows was previously known as Piccolini Private Nursery &amp; Kindergarten. The service was purchased by the Evolve Education Group (Evolve) in 2016 and was first renamed Leaps and Bounds before adopting the Active Explorers brand name.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 89 children, including 30 up to two years. At the time of this review there were 68 on roll, including seven MƒÅori children.</p><p>Children play and learn in three separate areas. The centre provides morning and afternoon meals for the children.</p><p>The staff team comprises teachers employed by the Piccolini owners. The new centre manager was appointed in May 2018. This is her first leadership role.</p><p>Evolve provides management support and a governance framework. A new area manager was appointed in August 2018 and this is her first position at this level of responsibility. The role of regional manager is currently vacant. At the time of this review, the new area manager is being supported by a manager from another region.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified a number of areas requiring further improvement. These included internal evaluation; partnership with parents; and bicultural perspectives. Some progress has been made, however these remain areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning in an environment well organised to support their independence and exploration. They participate enthusiastically in a range of learning experiences. Parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed.</p><p>Responsive caregiving enables teachers to respond sensitively to each child's changing needs and the preferences of infants and toddlers. They have space and time to lead their own learning. Comfortable, safe spaces successfully cater for children who are not yet mobile and for those who are crawling and learning to walk.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning is variable across the teaching team. Leaders should prioritise the development of systems to promote consistency of teacher practice and monitor the quality of children's learning stories over time.</p><p>Children's progression through the three learning areas reflects their age and learning readiness. Teachers are in the early stages of developing strategies to support older children as they prepare for their move to school.</p><p>Teaching practice is variable. A centre-wide philosophy to guide teaching practice is in the early stages of development. This should be a priority for leaders and teachers. The underpinning philosophy needs to be aligned to <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and the Evolve Active Explorers vision.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of exploring approaches to support educational success for MƒÅori children. Some bicultural practices are evident. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that the bicultural curriculum continues to require strengthening. They agree that increasing the use of meaningful te reo MƒÅori is an important next step.</p><p>Teachers understanding and use of internal evaluation is in the early stages. Further support is required to identify the purpose of evaluation and effectively undertake the process in order to improve children's outcomes.</p><p>Teachers are given regular opportunities to develop their practice through relevant professional learning. The recently revised appraisal system should also be strengthened and fully implemented to ensure that it supports teachers to improve their practice and build capability. It should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>constructive feedback and next steps for development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>targeted observations linked to appraisal goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate support for the manager to develop leadership capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Area managers have recently identified a number of priorities for improvement. They have produced a plan detailing actions to improve practice in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies to support MƒÅori children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies to support children's transitions to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policy implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's external evaluation affirms these priorities for improvement. Leaders should strengthen their action plan to more deliberately reflect current centre practices and to clearly identify the impact of the intended improvements on learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Evolve leaders and ERO agree that for ongoing and sustained improvement, systems and processes to identify good practice and promote consistency of implementation should be developed.</p><p>A strategic approach by Evolve senior leaders is required to track and monitor progress in their identified actions and to address the areas for improvement identified in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers Greenmeadows completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>philosophy development.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA5]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Active Explorers Greenmeadows will be within two years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>30 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
