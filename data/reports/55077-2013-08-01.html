</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Footsteps Adventist Christian Preschool is adjacent to Parkside Christian Seventh Day Adventist School. The centre provides all day care for up to 50 children, including six aged under two years. A large spacious building, with two separate rooms and well resourced outdoor spaces, caters for the needs of different age groups.</p><p>The Footsteps Adventist Preschool board of trustees is responsible for the overall governance of the centre. The centre management committee, which includes the centre director, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. The centre director provides leadership and direction for staff. Staffing remains stable and all teachers are qualified.</p><p>Trustees, management and staff have effectively responded to the areas for improvement in the 2010 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are nurtured in an environment that is welcoming and strongly reflects the centre‚Äôs philosophy and Christian values. A sense of belonging for children, families and whƒÅnau is fostered through positive and responsive relationships. Parents are welcome to stay and join in their children‚Äôs play. Their knowledge and skills are valued and they regularly contribute to the learning activities.</p><p>Children engage in a wide range of physical skills and opportunities for group or independent play. The centre environment reflects the multi-cultural backgrounds of the families attending.</p><p>The curriculum is child-centred and based on their interests, strengths and needs. It promotes learning through creative and imaginative play with opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy concepts. Independence and self-help skills are fostered.</p><p>A high ratio of adults to toddlers caters well for these children's needs and care routines. Free flow between spaces provides opportunities for siblings to interact and for older children to support younger children.</p><p>Children enjoy a range of well-planned and interesting group-learning experiences that integrate science and the arts. They lead their learning and engage in sustained play. Infants and toddlers confidently explore their surroundings and participate in age-appropriate activities. Teachers make the most of learning opportunities within regular routines.</p><p>Some regular use of te reo MƒÅori during activities and routines supports the bicultural curriculum. The centre director recognises that this is an area for ongoing development and is committed to strengthening te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori perspectives across all aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profile books support improved links between home and the centre. They record children‚Äôs learning over time and capture and celebrate special moments. Parents are encouraged to contribute to their child‚Äôs learning and are regularly informed of the daily learning activities in the centre. A well planned process is being implemented to ensure that all children‚Äôs learning is assessed regularly.</p><p>Children transitioning to school participate in a programme that extends their learning and prepares them for school. Parents are well informed of the schooling options available to them.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to improve their teaching practice. Management supports ongoing professional development for staff. The appraisal process identifies goals and provides teachers with useful feedback and next steps to develop their practice.</p><p>A comprehensive strategic plan provides clear direction for the centre. Self review is valued and focused on improving outcomes for children. Further links between indicators, evidence collation and more focus in reviews should strengthen the evaluative aspect of the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Staff are committed to the ongoing improvement of the service. Managers, leaders, teachers and ERO agree that the next steps to continue to improve positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>embedding assessment practices</li>
<li>strengthening teachers' confidence in using te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and strategies to support MƒÅori success as MƒÅori</li>
<li>strengthening self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Footsteps Adventist Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Footsteps Adventist Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>1 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
