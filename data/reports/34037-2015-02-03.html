</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kowhai Kindergarten is located in the rural settlement of Te Kowhai, approximately 10 kilometres north west of Hamilton. The kindergarten provides a school day service, with flexibility for sessional and shared places. There are 45 children enrolled of whom one is identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten has a very positive reporting history with ERO. The leadership and teaching team has remained stable since the previous 2012 ERO report. The kindergarten philosophy reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It seeks to provide an environment that is welcoming, safe and stimulating where respectful relationships are fostered. Children are to be empowered by a curriculum that is responsive to their interests and strengths, and encourages them to become confident, competent life-long learners.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All WKA kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschool</em> focus, which is a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Education Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten‚Äôs quality of education. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten‚Äôs administrative responsibilities are well supported by association personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA‚Äôs clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Te Kowhai Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>A feature of the kindergarten is the strong sense of community it has established. This promotes meaningful partnerships amongst the teaching team, children, their families and local schools. Children are supported to develop a sense of belonging and wellbeing, and there are high expectations for considerate behaviour. Kindergarten routines and the programme foster children‚Äôs social skills and communication. Relationships at all levels of the kindergarten community are affirming, sensitive and caring. Teachers know children well and are highly responsive to their physical and emotional care needs and education interests.</p><p>The teaching team has made deliberate efforts to strengthen bicultural aspects of the kindergarten programme. The identity, language and culture of children and their families are regularly affirmed. The kindergarten should continue its development of bicultural practices.</p><p>Children have ongoing accesses to a wide range of quality resources, and are encouraged to initiate their own learning. Teachers engage children in extended learning conversations that promote and model problem solving, reflection and creativity. Children have many opportunities to be involved in sustained and complex play. Written and oral language skills are successfully promoted through well-developed sign-in routines, the sharing of books and the print-rich environment. The language and concepts of early mathematics are encouraged through conversations that involve positional terms, and the opportunities for children to engage with measuring activities and manipulative puzzles.</p><p>The attractive environments stimulate children‚Äôs curiosity, and encourage them to engage and explore. Outdoor play areas in particular allow for physical challenge and promote children‚Äôs respect for, and appreciation of, the natural world. The life cycles of different animals are keenly followed by children at appropriate times of the year. The extensive gardens encourage children to be involved with caring for plants.</p><p>Children and their families are well supported through times of transitions. Teachers take an individualised approach to supporting children new to the kindergarten. Older children are encouraged to take leadership roles by assuming increased responsibility for the wellbeing and learning of younger children. There is a highly effective transition-to-school programme that includes visits to and from local schools.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to assess, plan and evaluate children‚Äôs learning and the effectiveness of their programmes. They are involved in ongoing professional learning and are up-to-date with recommended best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Teachers share their observations of children‚Äôs emerging interests and strengths, and use them to plan responsive programmes and complete well-illustrated, individual assessment portfolios. These portfolios are regularly shared with parents as documents and electronically on-line. Parents are encouraged to contribute to their own child‚Äôs assessments. Families have opportunities to meet with teachers to share their aspirations and discuss children‚Äôs learning and progress.</p><p>The head teacher and ESM provide highly effective leadership for staff and the kindergarten community. Together they set high expectations for reflective practice and model a commitment to ongoing professional learning. The head teacher contributes to professional and curriculum development within the association. Self review is well developed and involves working with evidence to achieve further improvements in educational outcomes for children. The teaching team recognises that areas for ongoing review include the:</p><ul>
<li>implications for planning and the programme from the recent enrolment of younger children</li>
<li>presentation of resources in some of the outdoor play areas to enhance children‚Äôs access.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the ESM and teaching team agree that the use of the assessment portfolios could be extended to:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate how each child‚Äôs progress and development is made clear for parents and teachers</li>
<li>review how children‚Äôs and their parents' voice is included and valued.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kowhai Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kowhai Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
