</table><p>Halswell Learning Tree is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Halswell Learning Tree is a family owned centre which provides full-day education and care for 50 children, including up to 20 children under two years.</p><p>The management team consists of the two owners and the centre manager. Most of the staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers. The centre supports teachers in training.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises the importance of collaborative relationships between the child, parents/whƒÅnau and teachers, and encouraging children's learning, confidence and creativity.</p><p>Centre leaders have addressed some of the areas for improvement identified in the 2015 ERO review, particularly the strengthening of systems and procedures to guide practices. Areas identified in this review that still require some strengthening include internal evaluation, appraisal, assessment and planning.</p><p>Since the last review, an area for infants and toddlers has been established and the Ministry of Education has re-licensed the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in calm, well-organised environments. They benefit from the teachers' focused planning. The learning priorities of respect, reciprocal relationships and social competencies are clearly evident.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from responsive interactions and secure attachments with a small number of adults. They are well supported to actively explore a range of appropriately challenging play spaces and learning activities. Teachers adjust routines to meet children's individual needs.</p><p>Learning portfolios explain and celebrate a child's participation in the programme. Teachers have implemented a new approach to their assessment and planning for individuals. The stories show how teachers' strategies are supporting children's learning. Parents and whƒÅnau are invited to contribute to the portfolios.</p><p>Children are well supported as they transition into and through the centre. Decisions are made in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau. Leaders and teachers have connections with local schools to support transitions for children and their families. They also make good use of their local community to extend the learning experiences for children.</p><p>Leaders value their relationships with families to support children's learning. They use a range of strategies to communicate and regularly seek information through newsletters, informal conversations, surveys and a daily diary. Leaders are aware of the need to strengthen the use of parent feedback in assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Leaders model clear expectations and encourage a collaborative team approach. Teachers are well supported through targeted professional development to keep up-to-date with current education and teaching practices. Teachers are encouraged to take on leadership roles and to share their interests and expertise.</p><p>There have been some positive changes as a result of internal evaluation and policy reviews. Leaders agree that they need to build a shared understanding of how internal evaluation could show the difference they are making to children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the centre leaders agree, that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>make the centre's appraisal process compliant with Education Council requirements regarding observations and summary statements attesting that standards have been met</li>
<li>develop capability and knowledge of internal evaluation</li>
<li>review and embed the centre's philosophy in line with parents' aspirations and current practices</li>
<li>develop practices for building learning-centred partnerships with parents</li>
<li>investigate ways for teachers to share and evaluate their teaching strategies and planning in more formal ways.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Halswell Learning Tree completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Halswell Learning Tree will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>22 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
