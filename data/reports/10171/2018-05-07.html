</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bream Bay Educare, located in the small community of Ruakaka in Whangarei, offers all day early childhood education and care in a building attached to the community recreation centre. The centre is licensed for a maximum of 50 children, including 16 up to the age of two years, and services the wider semi-rural and coastal community. Children are accommodated in two separate age-related rooms and share the outdoor area.</p><p>The service’s philosophy reflects the aims of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and emphasises a strong partnership between the centre, parents and whānau and children.</p><p>Bream Bay Educare is part of a group of ten centres owned by the directors of Educare Early Learning Centres and is supported by the organisation’s general manager. The umbrella organisation provides administrative and professional support.</p><p>The centre manager at Bream Bay Educare oversees the day to day management of the centre. The centre has responded positively to the recommendations of the 2011 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Bream Bay Educare are actively engaged in their play. They are warmly welcomed and settle quickly to the activities they choose from the wide range offered. Parents report that they appreciate the warm, responsive and supportive relationships they have with teachers. They note the benefit of these relationships for their children. Carefully chosen equipment enables children to explore and to enjoy physical challenge. Opportunities are provided for children to problem-solve cooperatively at their own pace.</p><p>Respect is evident between children, teachers and parents and is one of the values identified in the centre’s strategic plan. Inclusive practices help to ensure that all children in the centre access good education and care. Teachers work closely with external agencies to support the participation and learning of children requiring extra specialist support.</p><p>Affectionate relationships are evident between teachers and babies and toddlers in the under two area. The service’s routines are respectful and encourage children's independence. Teachers emphasise the language development of younger children. These children have a separate outside area so they can play independently. Older children have access to the area at times to participate in and develop close tuakana-teina relationships.</p><p>Teachers provide a good teaching and learning programme. They take part in appropriate professional learning and are currently involved in increasing their understanding of mathematics learning within an early childhood education setting. Part of their professional learning has focused on gathering parent and whānau aspirations for their children. Teachers are beginning to use these aspirations in planning further learning for the children. Teachers are now well placed to begin to evaluate the impact of their teaching practices on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Strong bicultural approaches are evident in the centre. Children and teachers are increasing their confidence in the use of te reo Māori throughout the day. Tikanga Māori is respected and elements of it are implemented regularly. Displays of bicultural activities and artefacts feature in the centre. Some programme activities recognise Māori themes, such as Matariki. Parents willingly contribute to the learning programme to strengthen children's and teachers’ knowledge and understanding of tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers are further developing and using their assessments of children’s learning to highlight individual children’s interests and dispositions for learning. This process should help teachers to plan more specifically to extend children's learning. Teachers ensure that children’s learning of mathematics is clearly highlighted in learning stories and wall displays.</p><p>The centre is well managed and is strongly supported by its umbrella organisation. The centre’s direction statement includes the centre philosophy and the manager’s vision statement. These statements are reviewed regularly to ensure they continue to reflect desired outcomes for children. The value of these documents would be increased if key concepts were further defined to help develop shared understandings amongst staff. The defined concepts could then form part of the centre’s performance management processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the owners and centre manager agree that key next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>providing opportunities to further develop teachers’ leadership skills</li>
<li>increasing the usefulness of self review to support ongoing centre improvement</li>
<li>continuing to improve the use of assessment information to inform ongoing planning for individual children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bream Bay Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bream Bay Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Northern Region</p><p>3 December 2014 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
