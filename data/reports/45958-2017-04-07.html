</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below</p><p>Some key aspects of practice need further development to support continuous improvement.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Brooklyn Kids is a privately owned and operated early childhood centre located in Brooklyn, Wellington catering for children from three months old to school age. It is licensed for 114 children, including up to 35 aged under two years. Three classrooms cater for the different age bands: KƒÅkano is for children aged from three months to two years; and Pihinga for those 18 months to three and a half. In May 2015, licensed numbers were increased from 72 to 114 children with the opening of a third classroom, K≈çhuri, specifically for children aged from three to five years. Of the 108 children enrolled at the time of this ERO review, seven identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Two of the four owners are closely involved in the day-to-day administration and management of the service. A new fulltime management position was created in 2016. At the time of this ERO review, the permanent appointee was due to return to her position after maternity leave. Of the 18 teaching staff employed, 13 are registered teachers.</p><p>The philosophy guiding teaching and learning emphasises the importance of: offering an engaging learning environment; developing reciprocal relationships with families; nurturing positive learning dispositions in children; planning a varied curriculum responsive to children‚Äôs interests and needs; and valuing diversity.</p><p>The February 2014 ERO review identified the need to align the strategic direction and philosophy to annual planning, self review, professional development and the budget, and consider ways of making the curriculum more reflective of te ao MƒÅori. Teachers also identified the need to strengthen their approach to assessment. These aspects of practice continue to require development. The rate of progress has been impacted on by organisational and staff changes, particularly in 2016.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are kind, caring and welcoming, working collaboratively to plan learning experiences for children. Their trusting relationships with children and strong focus on supporting them to develop socially is evident.</p><p>Spacious environments include resources to support children's learning in a range of domains. Teachers should consider reviewing some routines and practices to better facilitate children's interest in, and access to, learning materials over time. Plans are in place to lower some wall displays to support children's reflection on their participation in activities.</p><p>Flexible routines and consistent caregiving are in place to support infants' and toddlers' wellbeing and sense of belonging. However, overall, provision for these youngest children needs further development, particularly in relation to the quality of teachers' engagement with children, and the organisation of play and routine times.</p><p>Children's transitions in and through the centre are carefully considered and well facilitated. Individuals' needs are taken into account and supported by a familiar teacher.</p><p>A good relationship has been developed with the local school to support children's transitions from the service. Resources have been created for families, and activities planned for children. The next step is to develop ways of sharing information about each child's learning with teachers in schools.</p><p>The philosophy expresses a commitment to integrating a MƒÅori perspective in the programme. Short phrases in te reo MƒÅori are used by some staff and some resourcing has been put in place. Priority should be given to strengthening understanding of te ao MƒÅori across the service to inform a more bicultural approach.</p><p>Teachers prioritise the importance of developing reciprocal relationships with families. Information about parents' views is sought and valued. Leaders agree that building learning partnerships with parents to support their children's development is a next step. Plans are in place to enact this initiative.</p><p>Guidelines outline expectations for the development of the learning programme for children. A more visual approach to planning for learning has been adopted. Teachers are planning specific activities linked to children's emerging interests and themes. Some portfolios show how teachers are noticing, recognising and responding to children's interests and working to include parents' input in their approach. As teams are becoming established they should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formally planning to meet parents' aspirations for their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning to add complexity to children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledging families' cultures, languages and identities in assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening evaluation of planning for the group.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Team culture continues to build as new staff settle into the centre. Collaborative ways of working and reflective practice are being encouraged. Further clarification of expectations for roles and teams across the service is planned. Future plans include increasing the proportion of experienced teachers on staff to better support the sustainability of outcomes.</p><p>Suitable development-focused support is in place for teachers. Those that are provisionally certificated participate in externally facilitated induction and mentoring. The centre appraisal process supports remaining staff.</p><p>Teachers' and leaders' understanding and use of internal evaluation needs further development to better inform decision making about improvement.</p><p>The quality of governance and management continues to develop. Leadership of the service is becoming more defined. A good range of guidelines is in place. A longer term strategic plan which identifies priorities, outcomes, roles, timelines and actions should be developed. Linking this to the budget, internal evaluation and staff development is likely to support the sustainability of operation. The owner has made a useful decision to more closely link the budget to emerging teaching and learning priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation has found that next steps for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve the programme for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the organisation of resources for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote teacher capability through planned development opportunities linked to centre priorities and teacher needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritise the development of teachers' understanding of te ao Maori and implementation of a more bicultural perspective across the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation to support sustained good practice and continuous improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Brooklyn Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall and cause serious injury, in the event of an earthquake, are secured. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Brooklyn Kids will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 April 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
