</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five on Bader Street is a newly established early childhood service located in the suburb of Melville in Hamilton. The service opened in October 2012 and provides education and care for children from 3 months to school age. There are three adjacent, age-based rooms with ready access to separate and spacious outdoor play areas.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 65 children, including 15 children aged under two years. At the time of the ERO review there were 88 on the roll including 34 who identified as MƒÅori, many from other ethnic backgrounds and 15 children under two years of age. The centre has achieved a Healthy Heart award providing healthy meals. The teaching team has seven fully qualified teachers, two of whom have recently joined the centre. Parents are offered flexible choices for the care and learning of their children, including all-day and sessional options.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes, professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel. These processes are underpinned by clear vision and values. The professional and business managers have key roles in ensuring that the Kids to Five on Bader Street philosophy and vision are realised.</p><p>Centre leaders make highly effective use of self review to continually develop and improve the centre. They demonstrate a strong commitment to maintaining positive parent partnerships and providing a programme based on children‚Äôs interests and strengths. This has contributed to the establishment of a high-quality service in a relatively short period of time. Kidicorp Ltd. and this service are committed to providing equitable opportunities for local families and increasing their access to early childhood education. They have access to a participation vehicle for transport and work in close partnership with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>children learn through positive, meaningful and reciprocal relationships</li>
<li>a safe and inclusive environment for children and whƒÅnau</li>
<li>honouring of the Treaty of Waitangi and showing respect for all cultures.</li>
</ul><p>These aspects were highly evident during the ERO review, particularly in the positive partnerships established with MƒÅori whƒÅnau, the recognition of many cultures in the programme and centre displays, and the settled environment where children were confident learners.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers have established a professional team who work collegially to provide a high-quality education and care for children and their families. Strong leadership has resulted in open and transparent communication systems and processes. The centre manager has placed priority on building, motivating and sustaining positive and meaningful relationships with staff, children and their families, and the wider community. Particular strengths of her leadership include:</p><ul>
<li>fostering emergent leadership of teachers through sharing leadership responsibilities</li>
<li>modelling reflective practice</li>
<li>setting high expectations for all aspects of centre management and operations.</li>
</ul><p>Children are welcomed into thoughtfully-designed and well-presented environments. There are many opportunities for children to explore, experiment and experience challenge. They are able to choose from plentiful, high-quality and easily accessible materials and equipment. Many of these resources promote learning about natural science and the environment. Children and teachers make appropriate use of computer technology to extend and revisit learning, including access to games to enhance early mathematics and literacy learning experiences. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into appropriate learning experiences in each room through the <em>‚ÄòBe School Ready‚Äô</em> approach. This is contributing to children‚Äôs confidence and capability as they transition to school. Transitions are well planned as children move through the age-based rooms, resulting in a calm and settled environment.</p><p>Children under two years are confident and settled. They receive individual time with teachers during care routines and throughout the day. The head teacher models inclusive and responsive practice for infants and very young children.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the visibility and value placed on recognising the many cultures of teachers, children and families. Teachers share their knowledge of their own languages and cultures. For some families with English as a second language this provides welcoming and important support as they transition into the service. The centre programme for children and their families is enriched by regular celebrations, family nights, trips and excursions into the local and wider community.</p><p>Parent aspirations and children's identified strengths and interests are valued and documented as an important part of planning the programme. Centre displays and individual portfolios show current learning and children‚Äôs development and progress. E-portfolios enable teachers, parents and the extended family to contribute richly to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that useful next steps to strengthen the programme are to review:</p><ul>
<li>the audience and purpose of centre displays</li>
<li>children's‚Äô portfolios to more strongly reflect their individual cultural heritage</li>
<li>the provision of equipment that enables children to design and build their own spaces for adventure and dramatic play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are collegial and reflective practitioners. They participate enthusiastically in ongoing and centre-wide professional development and sharing best practice in the centre and the wider community. Teachers consistently use high-quality strategies that promote children as confident and capable learners. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>responsive, nurturing and affectionate interactions</li>
<li>learning conversations that extend children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>consistent use of positive guidance strategies that promote children‚Äôs social and self management skills</li>
<li>teachers sharing their love of learning as they respond to children‚Äôs interests.</li>
</ul><p>A member of staff is building the understanding of teachers by sharing her skills and knowledge of MƒÅori language and culture. This support should continue to develop teachers‚Äô confidence and competence in:</p><ul>
<li>using te reo MƒÅori in conversations with children</li>
<li>integrating local history and places of significance to MƒÅori meaningfully into the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids to Five on Bader Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids to Five on Bader Street will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>24 October 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
