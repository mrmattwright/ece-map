</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Rawhiti operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The kindergarten is located in the rural township of Matamata. It is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is open from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, staffing has remained consistent. The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Management effectively responded to the 2012 ERO report recommendation to involve children in more sustained and complex exploration. Teachers have continued undertaking professional development to keep them well informed about current educational practices, theory and research.</p><p>The kindergarten is well-supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust‚Äôs strategic direction sets out the service‚Äôs vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust‚Äôs professional leaders monitor the kindergarten‚Äôs compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management‚Äôs expectations. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>Teachers have a shared understanding about what they value as high quality education and care as outlined in their service philosophy. This statement documents a commitment to the provision of opportunities that encourage children‚Äôs self-expression, self-esteem, self-help and social skills. Children‚Äôs learning is supported through exploration, social interactions and during fun times.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergartens reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into Central Kids Kindergarten - Rawhiti. Teachers are knowledgeable about <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and ensure an inclusive programme, where children have the opportunity to participate in high quality learning experiences.</p><p>Children‚Äôs interests, strengths and diverse abilities are valued by teachers who understand the unique and varying ways children learn and make sense of the world. Teachers are highly responsive and notice children‚Äôs strengths and interests. They encourage children to further investigate and learn in authentic and meaningful ways. Children are capable of making decisions and managing their own learning pathways.</p><p>Teachers are highly skilled in engaging children in learning conversations. They build on children‚Äôs understanding, knowledge and lifelong-learning dispositions through the well-established positive, trusting relationships they have with them. Teachers view children as capable learners, and as a result children are confident to actively explore, investigate, problem solve and make informed decisions.</p><p>Children have access to high quality equipment and resources that promote learning in literacy, mathematics, music and science. Children‚Äôs creativity and imagination is generously catered for and encouraged to support higher level thinking. Access to technology such as iPads promotes children‚Äôs digital intelligence. The physical environment is thoughtfully prepared to provide children with challenge. They can take informed risks, and have many opportunities to capably assess situations and develop a range of useful strategies that help them achieve success.</p><p>Teachers have established a kindergarten culture where children learn in an emotionally safe, social context that cares for their wairua (spirit). They model positive ways of socialising and communicating. Children learn about fairness, social justice and skills that help them negotiate, take on other points of view and be responsible for the wellbeing of themselves and others. Children‚Äôs social competencies are nurtured and they are skilled in developing friendships and communicating with others.</p><p>Teachers value parents‚Äô knowledge about their own children. Parents and family members are viewed as essential partners in their child‚Äôs learning. The culture, language and identity of each family is embraced by teachers. Teachers support MƒÅori ways of knowing and being, and they celebrate and acknowledge MƒÅori as tangata whenua.</p><p>High quality assessment portfolios provide a rich record of children‚Äôs learning and progress. These capture the complex ways in which children learn and how teachers extend on their learning through play. Families have access to these in hard copy and on the internet. They are able to contribute, share children‚Äôs home experiences, and be actively involved in their child‚Äôs learning. These strong connections between the kindergarten and home experiences foster children‚Äôs belief in themselves as capable and successful learners.</p><p>The experienced head teacher provides sound professional leadership for the kindergarten. She is well known in the community and is now enjoying second generational families returning to the kindergarten. Staff are well supported by a knowledgeable professional leader who provides strong support and guidance for the service. The head teacher operates a shared leadership model for teachers and support staff.</p><p>Teachers are strong advocates for children and their families. Well-established self-review processes enable teachers to systematically inquire into, and evaluate the effectiveness of, their practices in promoting positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have identified through robust self-review processes areas for ongoing inquiry. They intend to further develop high quality practices in:</p><ul>
<li>information and communication technologies (ICT)</li>
<li>environmental sustainability</li>
<li>embedding te ao MƒÅori into assessment practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rawhiti completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>curriculum<br>premises and facilities<br>health and safety practices<br>governance, management and administration.</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rawhiti will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</span></h2><h4>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h4><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/" target="_blank">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">.</a><a href="[sitetree_link,id=]" target="_blank"></a></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
