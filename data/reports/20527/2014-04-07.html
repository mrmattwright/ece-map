</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playhouse Early Childhood Centre is privately owned and located in a modified house in Green Bay. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 49 children, including 14 up to two years. Children are grouped in two rooms, with the older children occupying the upstairs area of the house. Extensive improvements to the size and layout of the building are planned.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy recognises the importance of a balance between child initiated exploration and teacher provided experiences. Trusting relationships are considered essential to support children to take risks and overcome challenges.</p><p>The owner brings a range of professional skills from previous experience in business, planning and people management. This is balanced by the early childhood experience of the supervisor and office manager. The centre‚Äôs management team collaborates well to provide effective governance of the centre and leadership to the team of well-qualified teachers. They use a framework of well-considered plans and policies to guide operations.</p><p>Many of the positive features noted in the 2011 ERO report continue to be evident in the centre. Areas identified for development in 2011 have been the focus of improvement and as a result good progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They play and learn together in a calm and settled environment. They are industrious in their play and benefit from being able to engage in uninterrupted play. Children choose whether to play collaboratively or cooperatively with other children or by themselves. Teachers take time to engage with children as individuals and to nurture their development. Children play and interact with adults confidently.</p><p>Teachers respond positively to parents‚Äô preferences for care routines for their children. Infants and toddlers explore their environment freely. They play outdoors alongside and with the older children. As a result of tuakana/teina relationships, children learn from each other and are mutually respectful. The transition of younger children to the older children‚Äôs room is supported through these practices.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They share information about children‚Äôs interests and development. Teachers increasingly encourage child-initiated learning and notice and respond to children‚Äôs dispositions for learning. They record children‚Äôs participation in the programme and their learning in portfolios. The care and interest that teachers take in supporting the children‚Äôs learning is reflected in the portfolios.</p><p>Teachers plan together for appropriate learning experiences, including project work and regular outings to the local park, library and visits to schools for older children. These outings complement the ways teachers support children to develop confidence and skills in early literacy and numeracy within the context of play.</p><p>The centre management team has prioritised the development of bicultural understanding and practice in the centre‚Äôs strategic plan. Teachers have participated in professional development to build their knowledge and confidence in using te reo MƒÅori. Pacific children are well supported and some are able to identify and interact with teachers who speak their home language.</p><p>Teachers use an agreed format for individual and team self review. They develop appropriate individual goals for their appraisal. Manager‚Äôs use centre wide goals to maintain their focus on the centre‚Äôs strategic priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further enhance the quality of the programme and outcomes for children, ERO agrees with areas for review and development identified by the centre management team. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing teachers‚Äô understanding of bicultural practice and the use of te reo MƒÅori in the centre</li>
<li>establishing consistency in how the centre‚Äôs philosophy is enacted in teachers‚Äô practice</li>
<li>building teachers‚Äô capacity to support and extend complexity in children‚Äôs play</li>
<li>finding ways to gather and respond to contributions parents make in relation to their child‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>continuing to build capacity for self review to support ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playhouse Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Playhouse Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
