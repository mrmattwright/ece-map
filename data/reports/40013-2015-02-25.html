</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papamoa Playcentre is located in Papamoa, near Tauranga. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including up to 15 children under two years of age at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, the roll of 91, included 21 children of MƒÅori descent. The centre currently operates four general sessions a week that children attend with their parents, and two extension sessions that older children may attend without their parents. The centre also hosts an initiative to support mothers and babies, [Supporting Parents Alongside Children‚Äôs Education (SPACE)], for two sessions a week.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association (WBOPPA). The parent cooperative benefits from the ongoing support and guidance of a centre liaison officer and centre administration officer provided by the association. The WBOPPA also provide useful documentation and frameworks to guide centre training workshops and operations. These guidelines are underpinned by the association‚Äôs philosophy, which is well implemented by centre leaders.</p><p>The cooperative has made significant progress in addressing issues identified in the 2011 ERO report. Leaders have made effective use of self review to create a more welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment for families. They have strengthened biculturalism and systems to share good practices. Other improvements include parents attending more than one session a week, the introduction of extension sessions and re-development of the outdoor area. Leaders have also significantly increased the number of parents enrolled in higher levels of playcentre training.</p><p>The centre employs one very experienced playcentre member to support one general session and one extended session. ERO attended this general session and an extension session that is regularly supported by two parents with course three training.</p><p>The centre supports parents to learn with their children, and to facilitate and respond to child-led play in a manner that extends children‚Äôs interests. Members want their children to be competent and confident, learners, communicators and problem solvers, who are secure in their sense of belonging. In addition, they want children to develop relationships with other children and adults.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are capable and competent learners. They play well with and alongside others and form positive and trusting relationships with a variety of children and adults, including session leaders. They confidently communicate with adults and peers.</p><p>Parents cater well for the diverse needs and abilities of infants, toddlers and young children. They carefully set up the environment so that toddlers, as well as older children, can independently access resources and equipment, make choices, and direct their own learning. The centre also includes a spacious and inviting area where babies and young toddlers can safely practise physical skills without interference from older children.</p><p>Parents‚Äô interactions with children are respectful, responsive and caring. They skilfully foster development of social and language skills. Parents also make effective use of questions, suggestions and modelling to support children‚Äôs learning. They incorporate a high level of mathematical language in general sessions through waiata and incidental conversations with children about their play. Recently there has been an increased emphasis on including aspects of te reo, tikanga and te ao MƒÅori in the programme, learning environment and centre celebrations. Children also learn about nature, caring for the environment and frequently travel to places of interest in the community.</p><p>Extension sessions provide more opportunities for sustained exploration of literacy and science concepts, and mathematical learning through process cooking, shopping and measurement activities. Older children demonstrate well-developed social skills and frequently participate in complex process and other group activities during extension sessions. Session leaders make good use of wall displays to share assessment practices and children‚Äôs diverse learning experiences.</p><p>Parents demonstrate a strong commitment to the playcentre philosophy of collective leadership and consensus decision making. They have well-developed strategies to encourage and support parents to take on new leadership roles. The recent emphasis on truly valuing and acknowledging each person‚Äôs contribution has significantly increased parents‚Äô sense of belonging and level of involvement. The centre also funds in-session modelling of good practice and support for less experienced members to complete training modules.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified, and ERO agrees, that their next steps are to work with the association to systematically build parents‚Äô overall confidence and ability to:</p><ul>
<li>use strategic plans and self review to provide clear direction for ongoing improvement</li>
<li>further develop the implementation of te reo, tikanga and te ao MƒÅori in meaningful ways with children</li>
<li>use written observations to clearly identify and plan for children‚Äôs emerging learning and interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papamoa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, parents should complete the daily hazard checklist at all sessions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papamoa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>25 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
