</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kinderhaven Preschool Henderson Central is licensed for 45 children over two years of age. Many parents make the most of the Ministry of Education’s 20 hours ECE funding by enrolling their children for the morning and afternoon sessions.</p><p>The centre has had a new supervisor since the last ERO review. She leads a team of teachers, some of whom are long-term staff members. A number of volunteers also support children’s learning. The centre is one of three operated by the same owners. Supervisors now work together more regularly to develop consistent practices across all the centres.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report recommended that teachers increase their understanding and application of <br> <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, as well as staying up to date with the latest developments in programme planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>Other aspects for development included increasing challenge for children, and improving the quality of learning opportunities. Some of these areas have been progressed well. The centre supervisor is focused on consistent good quality practices to provide better learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s curriculum is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. There are good systems for collaborative assessment, planning and evaluation. There is good evidence that the emergent curriculum is becoming more effectively implemented as teachers develop better understanding of this approach.</p><p>Parent perspectives and their aspirations are used to help develop the curriculum. An awareness of bicultural concepts is evident in teacher practice. The leader has identified that the centre's bicultural curriculum and te reo Māori are areas that they will further focus on for professional development. Staff will also continue to develop their programme for supporting children's transition to school.</p><p>Parents receive good information through learning stories about their children’s learning and development. Teachers are becoming more confident in writing learning stories, and in developing evaluative outcomes for children and for their own teaching practice.</p><p>Children and teachers have positive relationships. Teachers are focused on developing caring and nurturing relationships to support children’s learning and progress. Teachers also have positive and supportive relationships and partnerships with parents and the community.</p><p>Teachers provide good support in many ways. They come from different cultural backgrounds that reflect the children’s ethnic diversity. They are very aware of children’s needs and the challenges that face the culturally diverse children in the centre, including those with English as an additional language. There are good strategies practised by teachers to support and develop children’s communication. Teachers’ conversations with children extend their language skills, vocabulary and knowledge.</p><p>Teachers encourage imaginative play and respond to children’s interests. They incorporate some literacy and mathematics concepts in play. This good practice could be extended to support children’s thinking, particularly in the outside play environment. A next step for staff is to consider how resources can be used better for both the inside and outside spaces to enhance children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers model enthusiasm, politeness, and appropriate social skills. There are good teaching practices occurring. Good modelling of teaching practices by the supervisor will continue to develop the quality and consistency of all teaching practices.</p><p>The supervisor is establishing a culture of ongoing improvement and building professional capability. She is encouraging teachers to reflect on and evaluate their own teaching practice. Professional development is increasingly aligned to appraisal, centre and personal goals. The supervisor has identified further strategies to improve the robustness of teacher appraisal and increase teacher responsibility and leadership.</p><p>The centre operates under the overarching Kinderhaven philosophy. This has been reviewed by staff and parents to become more specific to their centre. Clear policies and procedures guide staff practices. Good processes for reviewing policies have been implemented. The owners of the centre are supportive of their staff and their needs. A three-year strategic plan informs the annual plan and centre self-review. The supervisor and owners intend to further develop these areas.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further improve practice, centre leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to review and develop centre resources</li>
<li>continue to develop consistency in the quality of teaching practices</li>
<li>increase depth in teachers’ evaluation of their practice</li>
<li>further develop the alignment between the strategic plan, annual plan and self review. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderhaven Preschool Henderson Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kinderhaven Preschool Henderson Central will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 April 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
