</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned centre in Mount Eden and is the first of eight Little Wonders centres operating across New Zealand. The owner is the director of the service, and employs a centre manager and three team leaders to manage the centre.</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide for up to 110 children, including 40 up to two years of age. The centre is organised into five rooms. Children transition across these rooms according to their ages and stages of development. There are separate, linked outdoor areas for infants and toddlers, and for pre-schoolers.</p><p>The majority of children are Pākehā. Chinese children make up 14 percent of the roll. Small numbers of Māori and other ethnicities also attend. Staff are also culturally diverse and reflect the centre’s community. Many staff provide children with first language support. All teachers are either qualified or in training for qualifications.</p><p>The child-centred company philosophy has been personalised for this centre and reviewed by teachers and parents. Teachers are committed to the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The <em>Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE)</em> philosophy of respect for children and freedom of movement is also included in programmes.</p><p>The strengths identified in the 2013 ERO report remain evident in the centre. These include respectful, positive relationships between teachers, children and parents, and robust self-review practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau are warmly welcomed on their arrival at the centre. The service supports new families to transition smoothly within the centre and on to school.</p><p>The centre prioritises a culture of children first and foremost. Children are happy, confident, and articulate. Many demonstrate a sense of responsibility for themselves, their peers and the environment. Children have opportunities for tuakana/teina relationships and mixed-age play, which foster their social and communication skills.</p><p>Strong, reciprocal and respectful relationships support children’s sense of belonging. Teachers work alongside children having fun in their learning. They are very responsive and encourage conversations that support children's first languages and foster language development in meaningful contexts. Centre leaders are actively developing consistency in the ways that teachers promote language development through open-ended questioning and active listening.</p><p>The learning spaces are well used and provide a responsive environment with meaningful and natural resources. The outside areas strongly promote physical challenges, exploration, curiosity and risk taking, appropriate to the children’s age.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a comfortable and quiet area in which to play. The area is spacious and very well organised. The surroundings cater for a wide variety of developmental stages and support children to build confidence while interacting with each other. The RIE philosophy is strongly evident in practice. Responsive caregiving supports children's need for strong and secure attachments with adults.</p><p>Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace, allowing space and time for children to lead their learning. Toddlers are encouraged to develop independence in their play and to make choices about indoor and outdoor exploration. Older children contribute to the development of a curriculum that is responsive to their needs and provides them with good early literacy, science and maths learning opportunities.</p><p>The owner and leaders have a strong commitment to building teacher capability and confidence in their understanding about bicultural practices. Teachers take personal responsibility for learning te reo Māori and some have a strength with integrating te reo Māori in the programme in meaningful ways.</p><p>Parents and extended families take pride in sharing their cultural celebrations with children at the centre. Events such as Diwali, Chinese New Year, Fijian Day, language weeks and Matariki, are well supported by whānau.</p><p>Teachers use assessment and planning information very well to understand and identify children's learning. Parents' aspirations and children’s emerging interests are used well to inform teachers' planning for each child. Parents receive useful information about their children’s learning through digital portfolios, newsletters, and informal communication with teachers.</p><p>High quality, well aligned systems, documents and practices support centre operations and promote positive outcomes for children. A collaborative leadership team with a clear sense of the centre's vision, values and philosophy sets the direction for the centre. Professional development is strategic, and improvement focused.</p><p>The improvement and accountability purposes of self review are well understood and enacted. Self review is authentic, well planned and documented. Comprehensive processes guide effective teacher appraisal. To strengthen these processes, teachers could deepen their inquiry into the implications of their practice for children's learning experiences and outcomes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, centre manager, and team leaders agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepen critical evaluation of teaching practices, focusing on positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gather regular parent input through consultation and surveys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to prioritise the development of bicultural practices in their internal evaluation and strategic planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
