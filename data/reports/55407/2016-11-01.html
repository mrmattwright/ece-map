</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Chelsea House is a privately owned early learning centre located in Raumati. It is licensed for up to 90 children, including 27 children up to the age of two. Of the 90 children enrolled, 13 are MƒÅori.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. A manager leads the centre and team leaders are responsible for the over two year olds and children aged up to two. Coordinators also oversee rooms. Eleven staff are qualified and three are completing registration.</p><p>The August 2014 ERO report identified that teachers needed to develop shared assessment practices, enhance the bicultural programme and strengthen internal evaluation to build consistent high quality teaching.</p><p>Members have received targeted support in the bicultural area through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). As a result, the service developed an action plan that has resulted in improved centre practices and outcomes for children. Positive progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the centre actively engage in relevant learning opportunities. A sense of belonging is enhanced through positive respectful relationships between children and adults. Children are supported as confident, independent learners, able to initiate interactions and lead themselves. They communicate confidently with peers and adults.</p><p>The philosophy, currently under review, incorporates the values of respect for children, families and each other. Children are viewed as leaders of their learning and are given the freedom to explore and interact with others. They are encouraged and supported in an environment which nurtures social and emotional confidence. Relationships promote a culture of joy, laughter, imagination and empowerment.¬†</p><p>A newly-established system and procedure for identifying, monitoring and promoting children's learning is in place. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to individual children's emerging interests, ideas and passions that inform group planning. Wall displays and profile books of their learning are visible and shared with parents and children. The process is well understood and consistently implemented by teachers across the service.</p><p>Opportunities for parents to contribute to their children's learning occur regularly. Parent aspirations and profile responses provide links between the home and centre. Children's strengths, interests and next learning steps are shared. Each child's progress is tracked and monitored.</p><p>The curriculum is grounded in literacy and mathematics. Creativity is fostered through dramatic play, art, science and activities responsive to children's interests and strengths. Excursions provide them with rich local learning opportunities. Social competencies fostering positive and respectful relationships are interwoven through interactions. Continuing to build consistency in teaching and learning practices throughout the centre should further support children's self-management.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is a core focus and visible across the centre. Environmental signposts include kupu MƒÅori, natural resources and mana whenua information. Karakia and waiata are woven through centre routines and aspects of play. Teachers draw from a range of MƒÅori assessment frameworks to inform their teaching and learning. Teachers have been developing sound provision for MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Children's connections to their cultural identities are fostered through teachers' advocacy and parent and whƒÅnau input. Pacific children are supported to achieve success and their cultures are visible in the centre. Continuing to develop a working knowledge of tamariki MƒÅori, Pacific and other ethnicities should assist staff to further enrich children's culture, language and identity.</p><p>Programme provision for children up to two years of age caters well to their individual strengths and needs. Babies explore the environment at their own pace.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs participate fully in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers. Parents, whƒÅnau, staff and external agencies collaborate to ensure best outcomes. Inclusive practices, valuing diversity are evident.</p><p>Team leaders support children‚Äôs sense of belonging as they transition into and through the centre. Teachers support parents to settle children according to their needs. This includes providing a range of information, organising visits and developing learning records and routine information to share. Teachers continue to strengthen, establish and build closer links with a range of schools to enhance transition.</p><p>The manager effectively leads a collaborative team. Teachers continue to develop their knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation to guide improvement. Evaluation is being strengthened. Strategic planning provides clear direction for the centre and supports ongoing improvement and sustainability</p><p>Appropriate professional learning contributes to better understanding of responding to diverse groups of learners and effective internal evaluation. Emergent leadership is encouraged. The appraisal process supports teacher development to meet Practising Teacher Criteria. This should be strengthened through targeted observations, more robust feedback and annotated evidence.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that teachers should be supported to further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to show depth of learning for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation processes to inquire into the effectiveness of teaching to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultural knowledge of te ao MƒÅori and Pacific peoples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching and learning practices centre wide.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Chelsea House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Chelsea House will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
