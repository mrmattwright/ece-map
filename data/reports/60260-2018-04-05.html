</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kapiti Children's Centre is an established centre located at Raumati Beach. It provides education and care for up to 40 children, including 15 up to two years of age, in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>The centre licence was reassessed by the Ministry of Education when it changed ownership in April 2017. The new owners have renewed and reviewed the learning environment and the philosophy.</p><p>Since then, a permanent manager has been appointed and several changes of teachers have occurred.</p><p>The April 2016 ERO report found significant improvement was needed across areas of centre operation including assessment and planning, teacher appraisal and internal evaluation. In 2016, the previous centre owners received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). The current owners and manager have made considerable gains since 2017 and are continuing to respond suitably to the key next steps identified in the previous ERO report<strong>. </strong><strong></strong></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is clearly evident in the learning programme and throughout the centre's operation. Children show enjoyment and are confidently engaged in their play. Teachers are responsive to children's choices and play. Respectful relationships are evident. Those with additional needs have these carefully considered and additional support is sought where necessary.</p><p>Children up to two years of age confidently interact and play alongside older children. Relationships are promoted through peaceful, unhurried care routines and programmes designed to address the needs of the service's youngest children.</p><p>Leaders demonstrate a sound understanding of assessment practices that promote new learning and captures current learning. They have identified that assessment and planning for children's learning, bicultural practices and evaluation of the programme requires further strengthening. Leaders are purposefully building teachers' practice and understanding in these areas.</p><p>The new owners have a considered approach to change and improvement to promote children's learning and wellbeing. The strategic plan sets useful priorities for improvement. Self review guides decisions and informs decision making. There is suitable alignment of long term planning, teachers' appraisal goals and professional development programmes. Appropriate appraisal processes are now in place to develop teachers' practice.</p><p>Leaders and managers demonstrate a collective capacity to lead improvements. Parents are consulted about proposed changes in the centre and with their child's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, managers and leaders agree that the service's key next steps are to continue to implement and embed the developments identified in the centre's strategic plan. In particular, the need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural practices</li>
<li>assessment and planning</li>
<li>internal evaluation to know the impact of programmes, policies and practices on outcomes for children's learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kapiti Children's Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b> </b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kapiti Children's Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>5 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
