</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Monkeys Preschool is a privately owned, all-day early learning service in Palmerston North. It is one of two centres that are jointly owned and managed.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have staff and learning spaces separate to those of older children. The centre is licensed for 32 children, including 15 aged up to two years. Of the total roll of 40, 11 children are MƒÅori, and four of Pacific heritage.</p><p>There have been changes to the leadership structure of the centre since the June 2014 ERo report. The manager oversees two team leaders, who support teaching staff. Qualified teachers work alongside teachers in training.</p><p>The centre's vision and philosophy emphasise children's individuality, connections with whƒÅnau and community and sustainable practices. The learning environment makes use of natural and recycled materials.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas for development. These included aspects of internal evaluation, leadership and mentoring, the bicultural curriculum, and partnership with parents. Progress is evident in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in a rich, mostly child-led curriculum. Teachers work responsively alongside children, supporting them in play. They give children opportunities to lead and foster their social competence and self-help skills. Literacy is effectively woven into teaching interactions. Teachers skilfully encourage physical exploration and challenge to promote learning. Events and excursions, based on children‚Äôs interests, extend the programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers lead their learning in a calm environment. Teachers are warmly responsive to their cues and non-verbal communication. They effectively support oral language. Consistent routines and staffing promote children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing. Teachers work at children‚Äôs level and invite their engagement. Respectful practice is evident.¬†</p><p>A range of thoughtful strategies promote children's and families' sense of belonging when first enrolling at the centre. Transitions between age groups are flexible and responsive to children's needs. Teachers work collaboratively within the team and with whƒÅnau to plan for these transitions. Useful learning and wellbeing information is shared. A range of strategies and initiatives support children and families as they transition from the centre to school.</p><p>Teachers work alongside families and external agencies to support children with additional learning needs. Plans and monitoring for these children are well considered.</p><p>Children regularly see, hear and experience elements of te ao MƒÅori. Events and visual displays support this valuable learning. Teachers are exploring kaupapa MƒÅori concepts with children and within programme documentation. Leaders and teachers have identified the bicultural curriculum as an ongoing improvement focus. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>ERO and leaders agree that a next step for the centre is to develop and implement targeted, culturally responsive strategies for the promotion of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children. They should continue to engage with relevant research and professional learning opportunities in this area.</p><p>Teachers plan strategies and activities based on close observation of individual children‚Äôs emerging interests, strengths and needs. Clear links are made between planned learning outcomes and the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Plans are regularly revisited and evaluated, with a focus on children‚Äôs engagement. Leaders should now support teachers to consistently focus assessment, planning and evaluation on children's progress. Assessments should clearly show how intentional teaching strategies have resulted in new learning.</p><p>A key next step for the centre is for teachers to further develop their positive relationships with parents and whƒÅnau into purposeful learning partnerships. As these develop, teachers should consider how well they respond to children‚Äôs language, culture and identity.</p><p>A useful framework guides internal evaluations. Teachers prioritise actions for change, share responsibility for these actions and monitor their impact. More robust data-gathering would strengthen the analysis aspect of this process.</p><p>Management implements clear, useful support systems for appraisal and teacher certification. Observations of practice occur. Teachers are highly reflective. A focus on improvement and positive outcomes for children is evident. The process should now be strengthened through the use of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>setting more specific, challenging goals to grow teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>targeting evidence to show clear progress against goals and the Practising Teacher Criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new management system is effective. Team leaders are well supported to take on areas of responsibility in their leadership role. More experienced teachers support those with provisional certification and teachers in training to take active roles in the centre.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the centre's priorities are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation, to clearly link teaching strategies with children's progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning-based partnerships with parents, including the gathering of information about what families want for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies for promoting the educational success of MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Monkeys Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Monkeys Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>23 August 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
