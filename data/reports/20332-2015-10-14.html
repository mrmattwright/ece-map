</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Takapuna was previously known as the North Shore Leisure-Takapuna Cr√®che. While still located at North Shore Leisure, the service is now one of 10 early childhood education (ECE) centres across the wider Auckland region centrally managed by the Auckland Council.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs operations have benefitted from the Auckland Council‚Äôs new ECE management structure and systems. Since ERO‚Äôs 2012 review, the centre has been relicensed, and the new council licensee and curriculum leader are now strategically positioned to support the on-site head teacher and staff.</p><p>Other significant changes have occurred during this time. The service now offers a wider variety of full day, session and casual attendance options. This enables parents to utilise the government‚Äôs twenty hour subsidy and consequently roll numbers and attendance have increased.</p><p>The centre has places for 30 children including 10 up to the age of two years. The facilities provide for mixed age play, with separate play area for infants and toddlers. Teachers are reviewing centre routines and practices. Health and safety and employment policies have been updated and are now aligned to Auckland Council‚Äôs expectations.</p><p>The staff work very collegially and many, including the head teacher, have worked at the centre for an extended period. The majority are registered teachers. They are aware of ongoing changes and plans for future improvements.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children attending Kauri Kids Takapuna are very familiar with the routines and expectations of the programme. They are confident children who make friends with each other and make good use of the equipment provided. They relate positively to the teachers and can share their interests, feelings and concerns.</p><p>Children benefit from the small roll number and opportunities for mixed age play. They are considerate of one another and include others in their play. Infants and toddlers are nurtured and well cared for. Infants have appropriately selected resources and enjoy periods of one-to-one interaction with designated staff.</p><p>Teachers are currently reviewing and evaluating their planning and assessment practices. They have recently introduced portfolios to document each child‚Äôs learning journey, using observations and photographs to identify children‚Äôs progress and learning dispositions. A centre goal is to build stronger learning partnerships with parents to better share and extend the use of portfolios.</p><p>Children can independently access a wide variety of good quality learning resources. The programme reflects key aspects of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and provides opportunities for self-selected play. Children are encouraged to explore the environment and use equipment creatively. Well developed centre plans to extend the outdoor area will greatly enhance opportunities for learning.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô planning is becoming more child-centred and individualised. Teachers recognise and respond to children‚Äôs strengths and interests. Positive engagement enhances learning relationships. Teachers should now increase ways for children to lead their own learning and limit interruptions to this self directed learning time. This would create greater opportunities for extended and sustained play.</p><p>More children are staying at the centre until they are five and making the transition from this centre to school. Teachers have introduced ‚ÄúTui Time‚Äù a useful programme to support skills for school readiness. They have included aspects of writing and numeracy, together with drawing, oral language and self management. Teachers are planning to strengthen these ‚Äòtransition to school‚Äô procedures in consultation with parents.</p><p>Centre leadership has been strengthened. The head teacher has had good opportunities for professional development and increased support for leading the teaching team. Teachers are benefitting from opportunities to share with others in the wider Kauri Kids organisation.</p><p>Centre leaders are preparing to implement a new appraisal system that will encourage teachers to reflect on their practice in response to the Practicing Teacher Criteria. Self review is improvement focused and documented, and recent staff training has usefully included aspects of the early childhood Licensing Criteria.</p><p>Centre leaders anticipate that new Kauri Kids vision and philosophy statements will provide a useful framework for whole centre self review and teachers‚Äô individual reflection.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kauri Kids‚Äô centre managers are developing more strategic approaches to guiding the development of its learning centres. This is enabling Kauri Kids Takapuna to identify key next steps in its centre goals and action plans. These include:</p><ul>
<li>upgrading and extending the outdoor learning environment</li>
<li>enhancing learning partnerships with parents</li>
<li>reviewing bicultural practises and use of te reo MƒÅori</li>
<li>ensuring the programme challenges and extends older children.</li>
</ul><p>These steps have a clear focus on outcomes for children. They are likely to sustain recent developments and lead to further improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Takapuna completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kauri Kids Takapuna will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
