</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Young Explorers Early Learning Centre is situated in Buckland, a rural village on the outskirts of Pukekohe. It is a mixed-age centre that provides full day education and care for children from three months old to school age. The service is licensed for 40 children, up to 10 of who can be under two years of age. The centre embraces <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and the philosophies of Reggio Emilia and Magda Gerber’s Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE).</p><p>Young Explorers caters for a largely New Zealand European/Pākehā community with a very small number of Māori children. The owner/manager leads a team of qualified teachers, with two thirds of this team being provisionally registered teachers. She mentors and supports teachers towards gaining their full practising certificate. There is a high teacher-to-child ratio across the centre.</p><p>In 2012 ERO identified many positive aspects of the service, including the support provided for children's learning, the quality of partnerships with parents, and the centre’s commitment to New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. These strengths continue to be features of the service. The owner/manager has responded positively to ERO’s suggestions for increasing parent understanding of the curriculum and continuing to grow teacher capability in early childhood education and care.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Caring and positive relationships underpin the centre environment. Children and parents are warmly welcomed and children happily engage in play and connect with their friends. Children are considered to be capable and confident learners by teachers. Children's ideas and thoughts are respected and valued during periods of free play. The centre has appropriately adapted parts of the Reggio approach to suit the New Zealand context.</p><p>The physical learning environment continues to be a feature of the centre and encourages children’s curiosity. Teachers extend children's learning by taking advantage of their rural surroundings. Children have access to a variety of natural resources. Art and creativity feature prominently in the curriculum using the environment as motivation. The owner/manager could now consider further ways for the environment to provide opportunities for physical challenge.</p><p>There are many opportunities throughout the day for children to make choices about their play. Mathematics and language development are emphasised throughout the programme and are effectively integrated into children's play. Teachers promote te reo Māori and aspects of tikanga during daily routines to extend the centre’s approach to New Zealand’s bicultural heritage.</p><p>A further feature of the programme is the emphasis placed on continuity of care. Parents comment on the close bonds established between members of the group that children stay with over their time at the centre. Care groups gather together daily to participate in activities based on an overarching theme. These activities are based on children's and teacher’s interests. It would now be timely for teachers to review these group times to ensure all activities stimulate and engage children and further enrich their learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a dedicated safe place in which to socialise and to develop language and skills. The basis of the RIE approach is respect and this is very evident in practice. Consideration could be given to providing a changing range of resources to further encourage infants’ and toddlers’ exploration.</p><p>Good systems are in place to enhance the partnership between staff and parents. Children's learning is monitored and reported through suitable processes. Teachers reflect on the progress and development of children's learning dispositions and skills. Teacher reflections would be strengthened by deeper analysis of the impact of their teaching practices on outcomes for children.</p><p>The owner/manager is working actively to increase the sustainability of the centre. There are appropriate shared leadership responsibilities within the team. Effective self-review systems and procedures enable a variety of evidence to be gathered to guide decision making for improvement. However, self review practice is currently focused mainly on teacher-led projects. It could now be usefully expanded to all areas of the curriculum and to evaluating progress made in achieving centre goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner/manager acknowledges the key next step is to engage in rigorous, evidence-based self review to evaluate the impact of the programme on positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Young Explorers Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the centre owner/manager should:</p><ul>
<li>review and update all policies and procedures to ensure they meet current legislation and best practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>ensure an analysis of risk is completed for each trip outside the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Young Explorers Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>2 September 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
