</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Pipiwai Road in Kamo, Whangarei, is licensed to provide full day education and care for 50 children, aged from birth to school age. Infants and toddlers up to two years of age are catered for in a separate area. Two other age groups share an outdoor playground but have their own indoor areas. The Adventurers room provides for children between two and three-and-a half years of age. The Explorers room caters for older children, up to five years of age.</p><p>Formerly part of the ABC early childhood group, the centre is now part of the Kidicorp organisation. It operates alongside the Kamo Preschool Centre on the same site. This has resulted in new resources, including improvements to the indoor and outdoor environment. Kidicorp personnel work effectively with a newly appointed centre manager and staff to promote good quality education and care.</p><p>Kidicorp has recently initiated a van service to transport children who otherwise may not be able to attend an early childhood centre. This service is well used by MƒÅori whƒÅnau and has increased the number of MƒÅori children enrolled in the centre. Teachers continue to develop their understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and to consider ways to foster the language, culture and identity of these children.</p><p>The teaching team comprises fully and provisionally registered teachers, with two teachers still in training. The centre manager leads by example and is highly respected by children, teachers and parents. Teachers are well supported to sustain the good practices identified in the 2011 ERO report and to continue lifting the quality of teaching to benefit children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled and have a sense of belonging in the centre. They have warm and affectionate relationships with teachers and interact positively with their friends. Most children engage well with a good range of resources and activities and are responsive to teachers‚Äô support for their play. They often share with others and sometimes work independently. Children benefit from the Kidicorp ‚ÄòBe School Ready‚Äô programme, which fosters their resilience, independence and ability to be self-managing. As a result, children from a very young age are developing a sense of themselves as capable learners.</p><p>Teachers know children very well. Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a warm and nurturing environment. Teachers create an accessible area for babies to explore a selection of suitable resources and materials for play. There is a teacher designated to help these children transition to the over two area.</p><p>Teachers work well with children in the Adventurers room. They ask children questions and extend their ideas about their interests. Teachers have expectations that children will take responsibility for themselves and help each other. Children happily make choices about their play in groups or individually during activities, at meal times and mat times.</p><p>The Explorers room reflects the Reggio Emilia philosophy where pre-school children guide their own learning, based on their interests. Teachers set up resources in this room to provoke children‚Äôs curiosity. ERO and centre managers agree that this learning space needs to be more consistently available for all children to use.</p><p>Good professional development is provided by a visiting teacher who is fluent in te reo o Ngapuhi. Children at the centre have the opportunity to sing waiata with actions, say karakia and become familiar with phrases in te reo MƒÅori. Teachers could now make better use of this opportunity to further develop their capability in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes that reflect children's emerging interests. They are committed to embracing the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and making links with the key competencies in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> (NZC). There is now a need for teachers to focus on using better questioning techniques to extend children‚Äôs thinking and knowledge. More open-ended use of resources would help to stimulate children‚Äôs exploration and creativity.</p><p>Parents can see and read about children's learning through some very good quality photo stories and narratives. An annual survey enables parents to provide feedback about their children‚Äôs interests and aspirations. Children‚Äôs assessment portfolios could be further improved with greater contributions from parents.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers are well supported by Kidicorp. Regular support visits, frequent professional development opportunities and systems to monitor standards help staff to improve centre practices. Detailed strategic and annual action plans for each room guide centre development. Teachers also take responsibility for reviewing practices within their own areas. Managers recognise the need for continued development in self review and are particularly focused on their ‚Äòbicultural journey‚Äô in 2014.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that, in order to further develop the quality of teaching practices and learning outcomes for children, teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop teaching practices that facilitate more sustained and complex play</li>
<li>ensure early literacy and numeracy concepts, and science and technology opportunities, are integrated in meaningful ways through play</li>
<li>increase parent contributions in programmes and portfolios.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Pipiwai Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Pipiwai Road will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>16 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
