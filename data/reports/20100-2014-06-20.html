</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lincoln Road Childcare and Kindergarten operates in the premises of the Lincoln Road Bible Chapel in Henderson, West Auckland. It provides education and care for up to 32 children over two years of age. The centre is led by an experienced head teacher, appointed in 2012. The centre continues to benefit from the support of the Chapel management board.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs roll reflects the increasingly diverse local community. Families‚Äô home languages are highly valued and encouraged in the centre. Teachers are well qualified and value parents‚Äô involvement in their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report identified the need to improve curriculum and management practices. The centre has responded positively to ERO‚Äôs recommendations and is continuing to strengthen and consolidate improvements made to date.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and happy in the centre. They experience positive relationships with their peers and teachers. They have access to the outdoor grass and garden areas, and large climbing frames. Children choose their own play, make their own decisions, and work well independently and in small groups. They are becoming confident and competent learners.</p><p>Christian values of ‚Äòkindness, joy and respect‚Äô are acknowledged and integrated into the curriculum. Teachers are caring and respectful and prioritise children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. They work at children‚Äôs level, allow them time and space, and prompt their extended learning. Children show perseverance and take risks in a welcoming, calm and supportive learning environment.</p><p>A separate space is available for children up to three years of age. Tuakana/teina relationships are supported as these children move freely throughout the centre and interact with their older peers. The teachers acknowledge that it is timely to review and consider ways to improve this separate area.</p><p>Good relationships between teachers and parents help to inform planning for children‚Äôs learning. Some parents remain during sessions and help by reading to groups of children and working alongside them in play areas.</p><p>The teaching staff are collaborative and cooperative. They have participated in focused professional learning programmes and have a good understanding of Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum. They have a good knowledge about how the curriculum supports children‚Äôs interests and aspirations. Useful assessment and planning practices provide teachers with a shared understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development. Portfolios provide a record of children‚Äôs learning over time. Children can revisit their learning through some displays at child height. The head teacher recognises that they could review and improve these displays and children‚Äôs access to good quality resources in play areas.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and respect the diversity of cultures in the centre. Some teachers are skilled in using te reo MƒÅori, or children‚Äôs own home languages. Cultural diversity is acknowledged through a variety of foods, signage, wall displays and picture books. Teachers are keen to strengthen their understanding and skills in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Using Ministry of Education resources such as <em>Ka Hikitia: Managing for Success</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for teachers of MƒÅori</em> <em>Learners</em>, would support this goal. Teachers should also become familiar with the Ministry‚Äôs <em>Pacific Education Plan.</em></p><p>Policies, procedures and monitoring systems are well developed. They support the effective running of the centre and help promote good quality education and care for children. Rigorous monitoring systems are in place and help to sustain good quality practices and improve outcomes for children. Regular meetings and reports maintain relationships and ensure the Church board has good information about centre operations. Spontaneous and systematic self review is consultative and well documented. The head teacher is strengthening and developing the centre‚Äôs strategic planning processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and managers agree that key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support ongoing professional learning and development for teachers to enhance their understanding of curriculum implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to further support children to become capable and confident managers of their own learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lincoln Road Childcare &amp; Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lincoln Road Childcare &amp; Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
