</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Weymouth Playcentre is one of 16 centres in the Tamaki Playcentres Association. The centre is governed by the Association which provides a management and policy framework to guide centre operations. Liaison officers and other Association staff provide support for centres, including adult education programmes to encourage children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Weymouth Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the guidance and support of the Tamaki Playcentre Association. A key feature of Playcentre is that children and parents learn alongside one another and promote the philosophy of the parents as first teachers of their children. The playcentre is licensed to cater for up to 25 children, including up to 20 infants and toddlers. The centre is open for three morning sessions each week. Centre practices reflect the aspirations stated in the playcentre‚Äôs philosophy.</p><p>The centre is part of a multi-cultural community. Many families attending identify as MƒÅori. Bicultural practices are a strength of the centre. An inclusive culture and good links with the local community foster positive outcomes for children and families.</p><p>The Playcentre Association is currently undergoing a structural review to streamline its systems, policies and practices and promote the long-term sustainability of the organisation. A key priority is to encourage and support Playcentre members to take an active role in the governance of the organisation at the Association level.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review the premises have undergone substantial interior renovations. Centre leaders have been well supported by the Association to maintain the good practices identified at that time and to respond to the recommendations noted in the ERO report. The qualification levels of members have increased.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight playcentre reviews in the Tamaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, engaged in their play and demonstrate a good sense of belonging in the centre. They develop strong friendships with each other. There are strong tuakana-teina interactions among the mixed age groups. Children confidently initiate play and have opportunities for choice and decision making.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau are positive and encouraging in their interactions with children. They value children‚Äôs play and conversations and are responsive to their strengths and interests. Adults support the development of literacy, mathematics and science through play. Good systems are in place to develop and extend children‚Äôs individual and group interests. Parents/whƒÅnau are continuing to develop strategies to further enhance their assessment and planning practices.</p><p>Programmes are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The 'notice, recognise and respond' approach is evident in documentation and in practice. Association support personnel and centre members are continuing to develop planning approaches to strengthen the role of adults in supporting and extending children's ongoing learning.</p><p>Bicultural practices and perspectives are very evident in the programme and learning environment. Centre members have made good use of professional development opportunities and the skills and knowledge of more experienced members to increase their capability and confidence in this area. They use te reo MƒÅori naturally and in ways that recognise it as a living language.</p><p>The centre is well resourced. The environment offers challenge and invites exploration and choices. Members are flexible in their use of the environment and resources to provide developmentally appropriate learning experiences for children of all ages. Members are planning to further develop the spacious outdoor area to enhance their use of natural materials, environmental programmes, and outdoor physical challenges.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are confident in the environment. Appropriate spaces are provided for their play and care. Older children are well provided for, including equipment and space for physical challenge. Centre leaders liaise with the neighbouring school and with other local early childhood education centres, and are continuing to develop a range of ways in which they can effectively support children‚Äôs transition to school.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau take collective responsibility for the children. They learn together in ako relationships and have a collaborative approach to managing the centre. Centre members are encouraged to continue their participation in higher levels of training. They have accessed support from the Association and other professional development providers to strengthen teaching and learning practices. Leaders promote the Playcentre vision and philosophy, and work collaboratively and strategically to build the capability of newer members. They are considering ways to ensure the sustainability of these good practices.</p><p>The Association‚Äôs three year strategic plan outlines goals relevant to all centres. An annual centre management plan guides current decision making and development. In recent years the liaison officer has helped leaders in this centre to develop a framework for a centre-based strategic plan, to more comprehensively reflect their long-term thinking. Centre leaders should now further develop and implement this strategic plan to support and sustain progress towards longer term centre goals.</p><p>Informal self review is ongoing in the centre. Some outcomes are documented through planning and evaluation processes and through regular audits. Centre leaders recognise that they are still at the early stages of self review and want to now develop more robust and useful processes. Planned professional development should provide timely support for the centre to achieve their improvement goals in this area.</p><p>Association management policies are well established. Heightening awareness of Playcentre within the community is an on-going focus of the Association. Centre members report that the Association is very responsive to requests for support and guidance to manage the centre. The Association could now consider ways to further support centres to provide quality programmes for children and to promote improvement in effective centres.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members agree that key steps to support ongoing centre improvement and enhance sustainability are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop consistency in the quality of learning interactions and using self review to evaluate the effectiveness of practices</li>
<li>improving the documentation for planning and evaluation processes to more clearly show children‚Äôs learning over time and to enable a shared understanding so that all members can participate fully</li>
<li>further developing and documenting self review as a purposeful tool to build centre members‚Äô capacity for ongoing improvement</li>
<li>reviewing the framework for the centre strategic plan, and using it as an ongoing working document.</li>
</ul><p>The cluster review has identified areas of governance and management for the Association to address. These include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening strategic planning and self review practices</li>
<li>re-establishing performance management systems for all employed staff</li>
<li>ensuring liaison officers and licensing support workers contribute more effectively to improving the quality of programmes in centres.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Weymouth Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Weymouth Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
