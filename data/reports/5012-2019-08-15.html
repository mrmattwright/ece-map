</table><p>Te Kamo Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kamo Kindergarten is one of 22 kindergartens governed and managed by the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA). The kindergarten draws children from a wide geographic area and an increasingly diverse community. It provides six-hour sessions for 30 children over two years of age.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy values te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, ako (community of learners), ngƒÅ hononga (relationships), and te taiao (environment). It references Te Tiriti o Waitangi and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, as guiding documents.</p><p>The kindergarten teaching team includes a head teacher, two other registered teachers, an administrator, and a qualified lunch-cover staff member.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted next steps to build on existing good practices. Areas for development included evaluation, partnerships with whƒÅnau, and teachers' understanding of effective practices. Since 2015 the kindergarten has progressed these areas and established strong connections with the local primary school as well as other schools close by.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and settled. They respond positively to the warm individual greetings from teachers and their peers. They play frequently in cooperative groups, with high levels of conversation and friendship. Teachers' focus on physical literacy promotes, and challenges children to try, new ways of moving to keep fit. The addition of a healthy heart focus on nutrition has been embraced by whƒÅnau and children.</p><p>Children are empowered to be autonomous and have a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten. Teachers prompt children's investigations and support play. They engage children in reciprocal conversations about their interests. Children cheerfully share news and ideas with teachers.</p><p>Teachers have a strong focus on improving their implementation of a bicultural curriculum. Their work with a local kaumƒÅtua is evident in displays, children's portfolios and the use of te reo MƒÅori. Children are familiar with aspects of tikanga MƒÅori and demonstrate tuakana/teina relationships in their play.</p><p>A challenge that teachers have met well is the inclusion of two-year-old children in the roll. Teachers have made deliberate moves to ensure that children have a sense of safety in the kindergarten. They monitor the younger children, suggesting play options and supporting their growing social competence. Children play with increasing confidence.</p><p>Te Kamo Kindergarten has gone through a period of change and significant growth since ERO's 2015 review. The new teaching team has carefully considered and established a philosophy and team culture that is having a positive impact on outcomes for children. Distributed leadership recognises the interests and strengths of team members and has led to a variety of new initiatives that benefit children and their whƒÅnau. Teachers' deep reflection ensures that children's needs, interests and strengths are discussed and form the basis of curriculum planning.</p><p>Teachers have formed effective relationships with whƒÅnau, engaging in meaningful conversations that benefit their children. Teachers, children and parents planned and constructed a protective shelter for the mud kitchen that supports extended play well. Teachers are working diligently to be more actively welcoming and inclusive to those with English as an additional language.</p><p>Teachers have embraced NKA's professional development opportunities and new ideas from their professional practice manager. Teachers' knowledge of current good practice has grown and brought a sense of achievement about positive outcomes for children. Internal evaluation is well established and guides decision making. Teachers share their knowledge about children's learning with each other and discuss next steps for building on children's interests and skills.</p><p>The Association provides a comprehensive policy and procedure framework that sets clear expectations and guides teachers‚Äô practice. It has developed relevant appraisal and teacher inquiry processes that reflect the Teaching Council‚Äôs guidelines. Each kindergarten‚Äôs annual plan aligns to the Association‚Äôs strategic vision, values and goals. NKA employs a speech language therapist and seconds a social worker from Family Works to provide targeted support for children, whƒÅnau and teachers.</p><p>Professional practice managers (PPM) regularly visit kindergartens to provide leadership and curriculum guidance for teachers. A Pou Whakarewa Tikanga MƒÅori Advisor works closely with teachers to increase their understanding of and focus on authentically threading te ao MƒÅori into learning programmes. There is an organisation-wide emphasis on providing high quality resources and equipment for children. Leaders and teachers value and respect the thoughtful use of natural resources.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team agrees that their key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation to more clearly align with their high expectations of progress in their teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prompt children's thinking about their next steps in learning as a way of giving them more ownership of their own learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Association-wide development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening understanding of evaluative thinking and internal evaluation processes to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the Association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kamo Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>15 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
