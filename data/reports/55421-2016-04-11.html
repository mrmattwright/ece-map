</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pelega O Matua Fanau is a Christian based education and care centre in Marewa, Napier. The aoga’s philosophy places an emphasis on providing a learning programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and promoting gagana Samoa and fa’a Samoa. The aoga operates under the governance structure of the Ekalesia Fa’apotopotoga Kerisiano Samoa church (EFKS). The head teacher, who was appointed in 2015, leads a staff that includes two other qualified teachers. The aoga is governed by a management committee that includes parent and church representatives.</p><p>ERO’s 2013 report identified extending children’s learning and establishing self review as areas for development and review. Areas of non-compliance regarding health and safety were also identified. The aoga has made good progress in most of these areas.</p><p>In 2014 and 2015, the centre received professional support to improve leadership, and to develop management systems. This support has helped the aoga improve the programme for children and improved the sustainability of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Pelega O Matua Fanau has developed processes to improve the effectiveness of centre management and the quality of the programme. The aoga is committed to embedding and building on these practices to promote children’s learning and well-being.</p><p>The aoga provides an inclusive and supportive environment for children. They enjoy positive and respectful relationships and are encouraged to express their ideas. Teachers use Samoan language and children engage in pese Samoa. Children talk together in gagana Samoa and parents are encouraged to support first language development at home. Teachers are beginning to plan a more responsive and child-centred programme based on children’s interests and skills.</p><p>Children are keen to learn and willing to engage. They experience a variety of opportunities to learn through their play. Children enjoy cooperative and imaginative play and participate in a programme that celebrates fa’a Samoa, te Ao Māori and tala o le Vavau a mai Samoa anamua (Samoan legends). They have access to a good range of resources and the outdoor learning environment. Children’s self-management, expression and spoken language are encouraged. Children under two have opportunities to play and learn with older children. They are encouraged to be active and to try new things to grow their confidence.</p><p>Teachers and managers are committed to improving outcomes for children. The aoga’s appraisal process has been reviewed to increase expectations for teaching practice. The head teacher is externally appraised. Staff participate in ongoing professional learning and have developed learning relationships with other centres. Teachers would benefit from professional support to help them evaluate the quality of the programme and to extend children’s learning.</p><p>Self review is established in the aoga with the goal of promoting quality learning for children. Centre policies have been reviewed to reflect current practice. The aoga has developed a strategic plan that can be improved by setting clear long-term goals based on ERO’s <em>He Pou Tataki</em> framework.</p><p>The management committee has participated in professional learning and is focused on improving management practices to support children’s learning. Financial management has improved allowing managers to focus directly on improving teaching and learning. Teachers’ appraisal processes are implemented and now need to be aligned with current Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To extend children’s learning opportunities, teachers should continue to increase the level of challenge and complexity in the programme by:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop use of teaching practices to promote children’s thinking and creativity</li>
<li>improving children’s choice in play by increasing the availability of learning resources</li>
<li>reviewing the aoga’s philosophy to ensure it reflects the shared vision and values of teachers and parents</li>
<li>strengthening self-review processes and strategic planning by including the use of indicators to measure progress against the aoga’s goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education considers continuing with professional support to help embed effective teaching, learning and management practices in the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pelega O Matua Fanau completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure safe fall surfaces extend 900mm from climbing equipment<br> <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, (HS12)</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pelega O Matua Fanau will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 April 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
