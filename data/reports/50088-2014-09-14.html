</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nga Rito o Te Puawaitanga is situated in Palmerston North. It is located adjacent to Whakatipuria Teen Parent Unit (TPU) attached to Freyburg High School.</p><p>The non-profit centre is licensed for 37 children aged from birth to five years, primarily of teenage parents who have returned to school. Some spaces are allocated to children from the local area. Many of the children attending the centre are MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre operates as a charitable trust, supported by a management committee. The running of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager. A social worker employed by the trust provides support for parents and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are nurtured in an environment where whanaungatanga is significant. A sense of belonging is promoted through responsive and respectful relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers know the children and their parents well. Parents spend time settling their children, guided by teachers.</p><p>Strong bicultural practices are evident. The philosophy is anchored in te ao MƒÅori and underpins all aspects of the curriculum, teaching and learning, and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. The philosophy is being reviewed to ensure that it reflects current practice. Parents are encouraged and supported to participate in many aspects of their child‚Äôs learning and development. Contributions to the programme are valued.</p><p>Children learn in a calm and settled environment. Routines are flexible and responsive to children‚Äôs needs. Independence and self-help skills are encouraged. Teachers use routines as learning opportunities.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô interactions with children are positive and caring. They engage in conversation with children as they play, encourage and affirm them in their learning. Children have opportunities to take the role as teacher. They actively promote tuakana teina relationships to support learning.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. Responsive care giving supports children‚Äôs need for strong and secure attachments. Ongoing communication helps teachers respond to the needs of children. A range of resources are accessible to encourage children‚Äôs exploration.</p><p>Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests. Ongoing discussion guides programme planning. There is an established procedure for assessing children‚Äôs learning. Teachers agree they need to continue to develop programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices to better help them identify and support learning.</p><p>Mathematics and literacy in the daily programme are not strongly evident. This needs to be more thoughtfully planned for, assessed and resourced in the environment to enable children to become confident and capable in mathematics and literacy.</p><p>There is a strong commitment to promoting MƒÅori children‚Äôs success as MƒÅori. Children and staff use te reo MƒÅori and children learn aspects of tikanga throughout the daily programme. Leaders have identified the need to further strengthen teachers‚Äô knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori to support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leaders have identified some useful next steps to strengthen partnerships and understanding. Promoting success for Pacific children as Pacific is an area for further development.</p><p>Teachers are enthusiastic and work collaboratively. Appraisal provides staff with useful feedback and next steps to develop their practice and improve outcomes for children. Leaders have identified the need to strengthen appraisal by including use of the Registered Teacher Criteria and<em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners.</em></p><p>Strong partnerships, a shared vision and a comprehensive strategic plan set directions for ongoing development. A process for self review has been established and informs decision-making. Parents and whƒÅnau are consulted and their contribution to the process is valued. Leaders acknowledge that their understanding of self review is developing. They are being supported through professional development to improve their practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>strengthen staff knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori and incorporate this into the programme.</li>
<li>promote Pacific children‚Äôs success as Pacific</li>
<li>strengthen appraisal</li>
<li>continue to develop staff knowledge and understanding of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nga Rito o Te Puawaitanga Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nga Rito o Te Puawaitanga Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>14 October 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
