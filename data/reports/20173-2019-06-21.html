</table><p>Titoki Montessori Pre-School¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Titoki Montessori Pre-School is a well-established service in Torbay, and is licensed for 35 children aged over 2 years. The centre provides sessional and full-day learning programmes. A third of the children on the roll are Chinese, and there are increasing numbers of children from other ethnic backgrounds. Many children speak languages in addition to English.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs Montessori philosophy and vision, and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, inform the programme and guide teaching practice. It aims to provide a programme that fosters independence, respect, concentration, and creativity.</p><p>The centre is operated by a non-profit community organisation. It is governed by an elected parent council. A head teacher leads a team of registered and experienced teachers, who have additional Montessori qualifications.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reporting. Since the 2014 ERO review the centre has built strong learning partnerships with parents and families. These partnerships support the philosophy and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are warmly welcomed into the centre. An inclusive and respectful culture is strongly evident. Well planned and managed arrival routines help children to freely access play equipment and activities, and to settle quickly into self-directed exploration, learning and play.</p><p>Children are independent and play well with and alongside each other. They play and learn in mixed age groups at their own pace in a calm and supportive learning environment. Children benefit from caring relationships with each other and their teachers. They develop a real sense of being members of a learning community.</p><p>Children are capable, confident and articulate. They have many opportunities to hear and use languages other than English. Teachers respond well to children's interests. They use skilful questioning and engage in rich discussions. This adds complexity to children's knowledge and extends their thinking, vocabulary and knowledge of their world.</p><p>The centre is well-resourced. Teachers plan and provide well prepared Montessori learning resources, activities and provocations to specifically meet children's development stages and needs. They affirm and build on the strengths children bring and model the Montessori philosophy. Teachers interact with respect, acceptance and trust.</p><p>Teachers are culturally responsive. They acknowledge and affirm children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds and their unique identities. Bicultural practices are evident. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori in waiata and in learning programmes.</p><p>There is evidence of strong consistency in care and learning throughout the centre. Transitions into the centre and on to school are well planned, managed and evaluated.</p><p>Families actively support their children's learning and the day-to-day life of the centre. Parents are provided with very good information about the curriculum and children's progress. Highly effective learning partnerships with families are a key feature of the centre.</p><p>The centre is very well governed and led. Members of the governing committee have a sound understanding of their roles. The head teacher leads a highly collaborative team of teachers. They have a strong commitment to, and understanding of, Montessori philosophy and methodology, which they blend seamlessly with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Leaders and teachers use internal evaluation well to ensure continuous improvement and positive learning outcomes for children. Rigorous performance management practices and strong professional leadership enable the centre to maintain its focus on providing high quality early childhood education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps identified by centre leaders include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build sustainability by increasing teachers' capacity to lead centre operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop governance succession plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek external governance training for new parent council members.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Titoki Montessori Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
