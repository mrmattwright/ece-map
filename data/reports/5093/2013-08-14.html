</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pt England Kindergarten is a well established service that caters for children between three and five years of age. Most children at the kindergarten have Pacific heritage. Many children are close to school age and have recently enrolled. A feature of the centre is that many parents stay for the morning session to support their child and to participate in the programme.</p><p>The kindergarten is in the grounds of Pt England School and is close to Glen Innes township. Teachers have developed useful processes to support children as they begin school.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history and was last reviewed in 2010. Since that time changes have included a move to the kindergarten day model whereby children can now attend for a full school day or for morning or afternoon sessions. There is also a new teaching team and a further teaching appointment is about to be made. The head teacher has been at the kindergarten for twelve months.</p><p>Pt England Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional managers. In line with the centre philosophy, children are supported to play and learn within a curriculum based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is welcoming to children and families. Children‚Äôs wellbeing and sense of belonging are nurtured through respectful and friendly relationships. Children are settled and well supported by parents and teachers. The inclusive and peaceful learning environment supports children, including those with special learning needs to engage in a variety of learning experiences.</p><p>The learning environment is well resourced and offers appropriate challenges that invite children to explore. The outdoor area is attractive and includes vegetable gardens and cultural resources. A current project involves the construction of a bridge by the children and a part-time builder. The programme is influenced by special events, such as Matariki, and learning opportunities that include visits to the museum and local marae.</p><p>Children move freely around the centre and mostly engage in basic play. They have good opportunities to experience literacy, numeracy and science in meaningful ways. Children confidently use information communication technologies (ICT) such as the smart board, tablet and digital camera. Teachers are beginning to promote leadership opportunities with children.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed the way they document children‚Äôs learning. Portfolios are attractive and are becoming culturally inclusive. Children‚Äôs home languages are recognised and parents‚Äô contributions are becoming increasingly evident.</p><p>Teachers work well together and are developing useful self-review processes. They receive good opportunities for professional learning and development. The head teacher is well supported by the AKA to build staff leadership capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and teachers agree that useful next steps for Pt England Kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self review, including a more regular focus on reviewing progress against strategic goals</li>
<li>promoting an inquiry approach for further developing culturally responsive leadership and teaching</li>
<li>continuing to improve planning, assessment and evaluation approaches that support children‚Äôs individual interests and complex play opportunities</li>
<li>providing opportunities for parents to learn more about how to extend their children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pt England Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pt England Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
