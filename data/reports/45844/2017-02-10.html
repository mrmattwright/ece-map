</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Centres (Jervois Road), in Herne Bay, provide education and care for up to 59 children from two years to school age. The centre is located in a heritage protected building close to the Herne Bay Primary School. Two large rooms cater for different age groups. The Kiwi room caters for children aged two to three years, and the Tui room for three to five year olds. All children share outdoor play areas. The increasingly diverse community can choose to enrol children for sessional hours or full days.</p><p>The Evolve Education Group took ownership of the service in December 2014. The teaching team has remained stable. The centre director works closely with Evolve managers in the daily operations and strategic direction of the centre. The director is supported by eight full-time staff, including a housekeeper and a chef. Most of the teachers are qualified.</p><p>The philosophy of the service focuses on inclusion, respectful relationships and building partnerships with parents and whānau. It is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and inspired by Reggio Emilia approaches. The layout and resourcing of the physical environment provide children with space to explore at their own pace and lead their own learning.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified positive practices that have been maintained, including respectful relationships and meaningful conversations between children and adults. Teachers knew children and families well and good systems were in place. A developing focus on te ao Māori, improved self review, and high quality leadership have also been maintained. ERO suggested that teachers strengthen bicultural practice and their resourcing for different age groups, and review the learning programme for younger children. There has been good progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy is evident in the programme. Children are encouraged to make decisions and solve problems. There is ongoing open communication between children and with adults. Parents, whānau, community and teachers play an integral part in all aspects of children's learning, wellbeing and development.</p><p>Children's social and emotional wellbeing are nurtured with care. Teachers have established very good relationships with children. They support children to be socially competent and respectful of the environment and of each other.</p><p>The environment has well considered spaces for children to play in and to choose from the available resources. A good variety of equipment includes an emphasis on art and craft and creativity, and supports children to explore and be creative. The atmosphere is calm and provides opportunities for younger children to enjoy their own space as they play alongside older children and their siblings. Excursions to the local outdoor bush and parks provide opportunities for extended physical challenges.</p><p>Children are articulate and curious, and ask meaningful questions. They enjoy many opportunities to experience literacy, numeracy, science and art while they explore and have fun playing alongside each other. Older children share their understanding of the world with each other and their teachers. They are encouraged to be independent and use their initiative, especially when contributing to centre routines. Teachers value and respect children's decisions about their daily programme, and support them to be self-managing.</p><p>Programmes support children's individual and group interests. Teachers document and evaluate their practice and the learning outcomes for children. They could strengthen their evaluation by focusing more specifically on outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are aware of the purposes and process of internal review. They consider their own practice through ongoing professional discussions and reflections, and are focused on continuous improvement. Teachers have focused on strengthening curriculum documentation and planning, made positive changes, and evaluated their impact.</p><p>Parent feedback to teachers is very affirming. They provide teachers with their own ideas about the centre's goals and about teachers' practice. They appreciate the care their children receive and the nurturing and education that the centre provides. Māori parents affirm the centre's focus on bicultural practice. Many parents often provide online feedback about their children's learning experiences.</p><p>The centre director continues to lead the team well. She works closely with Evolve managers to achieve the centre's strategic goals and support parents' aspirations for their children. A distributed leadership model builds a cohesive team approach that works well for parents. An appraisal process has been developed to provide relevant professional direction and builds teacher professional capability and expertise.</p><p>The Evolve organisation provides policies, personnel and support services to guide and strengthen the centre's business and curriculum practices. Following a change in Evolve leadership, values and strategic goals continue to be reframed. A strategic plan guides direction and an annual plan supports the achievement of strategic goals. Individual centres are also expected to develop strategic and annual plans to support the achievement of strategic goals. There are good links between this centre's strategic plan, internal evaluation and teacher appraisal. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for development are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the evaluation of teachers' own practice, including their bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>document teachers' educational practices and theories</p>
</li>
</ul><p>develop ways to help children to understand the diverse cultures of Aotearoa and to experience success in their own languages and cultural identities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Centres (Jervois Road) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Centres (Jervois Road) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
