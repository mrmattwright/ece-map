</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nestlings Preschool provides full-day education and care for children from two years to school age. The centre is privately owned and operated. It is situated in a semi-rural area of Tauranga and is licensed for 30 children. Currently 41 children are enrolled, including two who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre's Christian-based philosophy strongly follows and promotes values such as kind and caring relationships. The centre aims to promote children's interests and uniqueness through a structured programme that fosters their confidence and competence.</p><p>The centre is a member of the Ot≈´moetai Community of Learners|KƒÅhui Ako.</p><p>Since the last ERO report in 2013 an external appraiser has been appraising the centre manager and the outdoor environment has been upgraded. The teaching team has remained constant with a new co-manager appointed in 2016.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has established strong, positive and reciprocal partnerships with families. Effective communication encourages them to take an active role in centre life. An online assessment tool provides parents with good opportunities to have input into the programme. Parents and whƒÅnau are actively engaged and well informed in their children's learning.</p><p>Children's wellbeing and belonging is effectively supported by respectful and responsive teaching. They benefit from long-standing teachers who provide stability and continuity of learning. Children are encouraged to play co-operatively and social competency is fostered through positive and sustained interactions. Children are empowered to become increasingly knowledgeable and capable self-managing learners.</p><p>The Christian-based curriculum is responsive to the strengths, interests, and capabilities of all children. The well considered and spacious environment encourages all areas of learning to be accessible and utilised. Teachers effectively use assessment for learning, which follows the children's interests. Teachers plan for a programme that is authentic, personalised and meaningful for each child. To further extend on this, setting realistic goals for children will allow their progress to be visible over time. The curriculum is designed to reflect a play-based approach to learning. A mix of adult-led and child-directed experiences promotes children's confidence and independence.</p><p>Teachers use deliberate strategies to extend children's emerging interests and ideas. Children are supported to make choices and decisions about their sustained play. They are able to fully participate in an inclusive learning programme. Te reo and tikanga are well-supported by teachers who are strongly committed to promoting bi-cultural practice. Teachers' use of rich language through engaging interactions is enhancing children's communication skills. Children‚Äôs learning is fostered and supported by intentional teaching practice.</p><p>Distributed leadership empowers teachers to take responsibility and lead aspects of centre operations. Leadership is focussed on reflective and collaborative practice, building teacher capability and improvement through ongoing self review. Through the guidance of an external facilitator, the appraisal process for the centre manager has been strengthened and now includes a stronger focus on building capacity and effective goal setting. Leaders have established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are, and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>The centre owner provides effective governance and management for the centre. She is committed to the establishment of a high-quality education and care service. Systems and procedures guide the daily centre operation and collaborative relationships with staff and families is a feature of the service. Christian beliefs and values strongly underpin the vision and philosophy that drive the centre's direction and development. The owner has created a strong organisational culture that is leading to ongoing improvement and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the important next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>implement formal observation as part of the teachers' appraisal process, including meaningful feedback and feed forward in order to build capability</li>
<li>extend on current planning processes so that they include more specific information. The process of setting measurable and realistic goals will further inform children's learning and determine their progress over time</li>
<li>source meaningful professional learning and development about a bi-cultural curriculum to deepen teachers' understanding of teaching and learning for MƒÅori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nestlings Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nestlings Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>27 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
