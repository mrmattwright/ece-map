</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Papatoetoe provides education and care for up to 66 children, including 15 children under two years of age. The centre is located in the Allan Brewster Leisure Centre. Many of the families who use the facilities also use this service. The centre provides casual, part-time and full-time education and care. It has six fully qualified teachers.</p><p>Staff have maintained the good practices identified in the 2013 ERO review. There have been some staff changes with many taking on leadership roles in other centres in the organisation. The long-standing head teacher continues to lead, mentor and inspire her staff. There has been targeted professional learning and development which has resulted in further significant improvements.</p><p>Responsive relationships, whānau and community connections, respect for tangata whenua and inclusion are aspects of the centre philosophy, which is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and includes an organisational belief that ‘active bodies have active minds’.</p><p>Kauri Kids Papatoetoe is one of ten early childhood centres that are owned by and operate within policies and framework of Auckland Council. The Auckland Council delegates management responsibility to the Childcare Services Manager. The centre’s head teacher works closely with a newly appointed curriculum manager, who visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four Kauri Kids reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in this centre have a strong sense of ownership in the centre. They are confident and articulate, some in a variety of languages. They engage in self-chosen, sustained play and are enthusiastic learners. Children play cooperatively and with acceptance and empathy for others. They use literacy, mathematics, science and information communication technologies as part of their play. Children’s creativity is encouraged through art, dancing, music and drama.</p><p>Teachers provide an interesting and vibrant learning environment where children make choices and have fun learning through play. Well resourced and inviting play areas support children’s engagement in play for sustained periods of time. The environment is print rich. Wall displays reflect teachers’ respect for te ao Māori and children’s diverse family backgrounds, and staff often use children’s home languages. Teachers share a strong commitment to providing physical activities. This is evident in the opportunities children have to explore and be active in the outdoor area and adjacent leisure centre.</p><p>Respectful, caring relationships between teachers, children and their families are a key feature of this service. There is a strong sense of belonging and partnerships with parent/whānau. Supportive and inclusive teaching practices affirm children’s strengths, identities and cultures. Infants and toddlers receive individualised nurturing care in an attractive, carefully organised area. Teachers work enthusiastically to promote positive educational outcomes for all children.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement a responsive curriculum that reflect <em>Te Whāriki, </em>the early childhood curriculumand the centre philosophy, and nurtures children’s languages and cultural identity. Te reo and tikanga Māori are a strength in the programme. Teachers have re-established planning systems and with support from the curriculum manager, continue to improve planning and assessment. Portfolios are good records of children’s involvement in the programme and show children’s strengths and interests.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and benefit from the mentoring and effective leadership of the head teacher. They are encouraged to take responsibility and share their strengths and knowledge. The Auckland Council also provides leadership and professional development opportunities for teachers as well as administration and professional support.</p><p>Self review is established and becoming more focused on improving outcomes for children. There is a shared vision and clear direction guided by the strategic and annual plans. A rigorous appraisal system has been implemented that aligns to the strategic plan and teacher goals. Teachers’ appraisals identify appropriate professional learning needed to support their development.</p><p>The Auckland Council has good systems to guide centre management and governance, maintain ongoing improvement and ensure accountability. A robust system is in place to monitor health and safety practices and ensure all centres meet legislative requirements. The Auckland Council has a strong commitment to implementing bicultural practices and responding to community needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that key next steps for the centre could include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation, using indicators of good practice</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of their programme planning and their own practice, with a focus on children’s learning</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the quality of teacher interactions with children and their whānau.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Papatoetoe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kauri Kids Papatoetoe will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 August 2016<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
