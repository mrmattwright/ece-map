</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Awanga Kindergarten is situated near to the local school in the settlement of Haumoana, overlooking Cape Kidnappers and the Kaweka Ranges. Up to 40 children can attend the centre at any one time. The current roll includes learners who share places across the week.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association (NKA), which oversees the operation of 16 kindergartens including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association and support for the general manager. Two education managers are responsible for building teacher capability. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa MƒÅtauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of Te Ao MƒÅori. He demonstrates a clear vision for MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau. The head teacher provides professional leadership to the wellestablished and experienced teaching team. An active parent committee supports the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Enviroschools programme and has recently been awarded Silver status. The areas of strength identified in the October 2012 ERO report continue to be evident. Teachers continue to develop and embed Enviroschools, bicultural practices and self review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergarten reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive, responsive, affirming relationships with others. Their sense of belonging is fostered. Families‚Äô cultural backgrounds are acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers make use of their knowledge about children and their lives outside kindergarten to add to their experiences.</p><p>The child-initiated curriculum has an emphasis on literacy, numeracy and Enviroschools. Children have some good opportunities to lead their own learning and sustain their play. Their independence is encouraged and they enjoy the company of peers. Children help, take turns and care for their environment. Teachers are responsive to their interests and needs.</p><p>Learning spaces promote a sense of curiosity and discovery. They reflect the local community and its surrounds.</p><p>Transitions are well managed to assist children and their families to become familiar with kindergarten, and as they move on to school. There are established reciprocal links with the local primary school.</p><p>Through the Enviroschools work, teachers have purposefully developed their understanding in te¬†reo¬†me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. A focus on embedding and sustaining the programme, and ensuring ongoing family, whƒÅnau, and community and iwi involvement are identified next steps.</p><p>Teachers have a sound understanding of the processes for knowing about children‚Äôs interests and their learning. Recent positive developments include the implementation of a system for monitoring their response to the goals and information parents share about their children and their interests.</p><p>Assessment portfolios include individual and group entries and provide a record of children‚Äôs participation and involvement in kindergarten experiences and activities. ERO and teachers agree that further developing and embedding assessment and planning processes is a next step. This should include deepening a clearer focus on the learning and teaching that is occurring.</p><p>Self review is focused on improvement and used to inquire into aspects of the programme. Teachers have made good progress in developing this since the previous ERO review. Widening the scope of review to focus more on how well teachers are improving outcomes for children as well as growing their teaching practice, is a next step.</p><p>The head teacher fosters leadership opportunities that use teachers‚Äô strengths well. Teachers are reflective and have a shared vision for teaching and learning. They work together in collaborative ways.</p><p>The association empowers teachers to use the team‚Äôs strengths to respond to children and the parent community. Education managers should continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes to effectively build teacher capability. These include self review, assessment, planning, internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten teachers and education managers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>further embed and extend the scope and impact of self review, including evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation as part of the planned review of the curriculum</li>
<li>improve appraisal goal setting, evidence, observations, feedback and next steps.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Awanga Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Awanga Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
