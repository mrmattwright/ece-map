</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fairfield Kindergarten is located in Hamilton and provides both all-day and sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 50 children were enrolled, of whom 33 are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviro-School</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten‚Äôs quality of education. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten‚Äôs administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2011, there has been a change of ESM and head teacher. Another teacher has joined the staff and an extended school-day session has been added. Two teachers have remained in their roles which provided continuity for children and families during a time of change. The kindergarten is committed to increasing participation for families by removing barriers where possible and makes good use of equity funding to support this.</p><p>Good progress has been made with the area for development identified in the 2011 ERO report related to assessment and planning. Assessment, planning and evaluation are now well managed and lead to a rich and meaningful programme. Significant improvements and developments have been made to buildings and grounds, including sustainable gardens and attractive security fencing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Fairfield Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children and families are welcomed and included by teachers who value them highly and acknowledge the strengths they bring to enrich the kindergarten. Teachers continue to maintain meaningful long-term relationships with the wider community. There are thoughtfully designed spaces where parents, families and whƒÅnau can share and be together. Families are comfortable to share in play and learning alongside their children and demonstrate a sincere sense of belonging and ownership. Parents interviewed by ERO during the review considered the kindergarten to be an important hub of the community. The recent review of the kindergarten philosophy resulted in a statement that strongly reflects the views and values of the community.</p><p>The programme and environment strongly reflect the multicultural and diverse community of the kindergarten. Children explore in spacious environments that are creatively planned and visually attractive. This environment empowers them as learners as they build their knowledge about Papatuanuku, sustainability and the natural world. Children have ready access to a wide range of high-quality equipment and materials that enhance their learning and creativity and provide physical challenge. They are confident communicators and express their opinions and ideas with their friends and teachers. Computer tools and technology are available for the use of children and families. Initiatives such as e-portfolios have increased the knowledge of teachers about children‚Äôs lives outside of the kindergarten. Teachers should now ensure that children‚Äôs use of computer technology enhances their learning and meets the intent of the kindergarten philosophy.</p><p>Particular strengths of the programme are the opportunities for children to:</p><ul>
<li>celebrate their own and others‚Äô cultures through play</li>
<li>learn about gentleness, nurture and other social skills</li>
<li>take risks, experiment and sustain their interest for long periods of time</li>
<li>build their understanding of literacy and mathematics concepts as they play</li>
<li>express themselves through the creative arts.</li>
</ul><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation is well organised and leads to a rich and meaningful programme that is shared and well known by parents, family and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Teachers are skilled practitioners and bring a wide variety of experiences, values and expertise to their roles. They work as a professional and collegial team in the best interests of children and families. The teaching team has established a culture that reflects the importance they place on identifying parents‚Äô aspirations for their children. Teachers listen carefully to children and families to gather their ideas. They document these to inform their planning for individuals and groups of children.</p><p>Teachers consistently demonstrate high-quality practices that include:</p><ul>
<li>deep respect for and responsiveness to the language, culture and identity of each child</li>
<li>rich conversations with children that extend their thinking and add complexity to their learning</li>
<li>modelling calm, respectful and peaceful interactions with children and families</li>
<li>affirming children‚Äôs strengths and using these to build communication and life skills</li>
<li>skilfully settling of children to purposeful play.</li>
</ul><p>The experienced and knowledgeable ESM and head teacher work in an open, transparent and professional partnership to provide effective leadership. The head teacher has established an enthusiastic team with a shared sense of leadership and direction. She is highly reflective and committed to providing an environment and programme that responds to the cultural context of children and their families. Self review is highly developed and effective in promoting ongoing improvement and sustainability for the kindergarten. This is evident in the head teacher‚Äôs enthusiasm for research and professional learning that extends her thinking and understanding about her leadership role and the realisation of the kindergarten‚Äôs vision and philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and ERO agree that continuing to review aspects of the assessment and planning cycle is likely to enhance outcomes for teachers, children and their families.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fairfield Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fairfield Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
