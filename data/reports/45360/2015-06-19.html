</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidiwise Early Learning Centre is located in the Bethlehem area in Tauranga, and caters for children from birth to school age, in three age-group areas. The spacious environment includes a large bush area and a variety of pets for children to interact with.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2012, the centre owner/manager has opened a new area for three and four year olds. A learning coordinator has been appointed to oversee the quality of practices and policies, and there have been a number of new staff appointments. Management and teachers are beginning to respond to the areas for development identified in the last ERO review about assessment, curriculum delivery and self-review practices to monitor the quality of education and care.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed the centre philosophy, which places emphasis on providing 'care and education for children and supports them in becoming independent, resilient and passionate learners, with great social skills and a deep empathy for others and the environment</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are welcomed into homely, inclusive, attractively presented environments. Children in all age-group areas have many opportunities to participate in a rich range of exciting, challenging and stimulating learning experiences. They explore and make discoveries in the bush area, and have regular excursions in the local and wider community, including farm visits and pony rides. Children and teachers have established caring, close and trusting relationships. There are many opportunities for children to socialise with each other and for older children to support younger children. Centre routines are well known and children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. They are developing as confident and capable learners.</p><p>Teachers use a wide range of effective teaching practices to support children's learning. They involve themselves in children's play and use children's interests to respond to teachable moments. Aspects of literacy and mathematics are integrated naturally into the programme. Books and computers are used to inquire and investigate into new learning. Transitions between age-based areas are sensitively managed to support each child's wellbeing.</p><p>Babies and toddlers receiving personalised care routines and one-to-one interactions with teachers. Regular conversations with parents and whanau provide teachers with vital information about children's preferences and needs. These young children have many opportunities to actively explore in a spacious natural outdoor environment.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in sustained play and learning in the 2 to 3 year olds' area, particularly in the outdoor environment. Teachers notice and respond effectively to their interests to support further exploration and discovery. Children's critical thought wondering and creativity are promoted through regular use of the bush and farm excursions in the 3 to 4 year olds' area. In addition, a regular X science extension programme encourages children to problem solve and predict through hands-on investigations.</p><p>Families appreciate the accessibility of the natural environment and the availability of swimming lessons for their children while attending the centre. Children's portfolios document and share group and centre activities with parents. There is a need to include more personalised explanations of individual development and learning in these documents. Teachers value the skills that parents are able to contribute to centre programmes.</p><p>The centre owner/manager is focused on the best interests of children, and providing authentic and meaningful experiences, including the provision of sustainable practices, caring for the environment and animals. Centre policies and procedures have been recently reviewed and provide clear guidelines for practice. Teacher appraisal processes are being developed. Teachers regularly reflect on resources and areas of play with a view to ongoing improvement. They work collaboratively and have established a shared vision and philosophy for education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There continues to be a need for management and teachers to develop a systematic, planned and deliberate process of inquiry and analysis to effectively evaluate teaching practice and improve outcomes for children. This would better enable them to review and improve:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation practices, in order to better reflect individual progress over time and monitor and evaluate how well programmes extend children's learning</li>
<li>staff appraisal processes that include ongoing coaching, reflection and monitoring, stronger links to the centre's expectations for teachers' practice, and specific teachers' goals focused on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO supports the centre's strategic intention to further develop their bicultural curriculum.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree whole-centre professional development is necessary to strengthen strategic self-review practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidiwise Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidiwise Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>19 June 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
