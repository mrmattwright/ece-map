</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre is situated in the children's ward of Rotorua Hospital. It caters for children admitted to the ward, and for their whƒÅnau and siblings. The service is governed by the Lakes District Health Board. Day-to-day management of the service is shared by the charge hospital play specialist (HPS) and the clinical nurse manager.</p><p>The service's aim is to promote children's social and emotional wellbeing, and to support their whƒÅnau to feel a sense of welcome and belonging. The centre is licensed for 25 children up to six years of age. Numbers of children fluctuate on a daily basis. Many whƒÅnau have MƒÅori heritage and there is a growing number of Pacific and Indian families with children in the ward.</p><p>The service is staffed by two qualified early childhood teachers, assisted by two relievers. The charge HPS also holds an additional hospital-based qualification. Some play and learning opportunities with children are undertaken at their bedside and in other parts of the hospital. This support is aimed at increasing children's wellbeing and supporting their confidence in dealing with complex medical procedures.</p><p>The HPS aim to provide play and learning experiences for children in this unfamiliar setting. The large playroom, deck space and outdoor area provide for exploration and different activities for children. There is space in the playroom for siblings and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children respond positively to opportunities to explore and find activities in the attractive and inviting playroom. The HPS include a wide range of resources to cater for children's interests and different ages and stages of development. Frequent conversations with whƒÅnau help in deciding what children might like to play with.</p><p>Special care is taken to acknowledge those children who are admitted to hospital on a regular basis. Their artwork and references to their previous visits are kept in the playroom to provide a sense of belonging and continuity.</p><p>HPS use some te reo MƒÅori in conversations and interactions with children. The playroom decorations and resources are beginning to reflect bicultural understanding. The placement of the playroom, looking down on the lake and the marae provides a sense of belonging and familiarity for MƒÅori whƒÅnau and their children. The HPS have identified their intention to improve their bicultural understanding as well as strengthening their understanding of Pacific cultures and languages.</p><p>Procedures are in place for the daily recording of children's interests, and suggestions for extending their play. However, these assessment procedures are not consistently followed. Shared responsibility for assessment and more equitable contribution to professional discussions and planning would improve the HPS team's ability to evaluate and enhance their support for children.</p><p>Governance of the service is provided by senior hospital managers. The charge nurse manager, the interdisciplinary staff working with children, and the HPS form a team that is passionate about providing a high quality service for children and their families. HPS have had opportunities to build their practice through supportive professional development, coaching and regular performance appraisal.</p><p>The service is in a good position to continue developing and refining systems and practices. The service's well written and meaningful philosophy statement and vision are evident in practice. Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the ward and the playroom by the HPS and relievers. Children are comfortable and quickly develop trusting relationships with HPS.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There are good procedures in place for the ongoing development of the service. However, the service is not yet reaching its potential. It is urgent that managers continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen leadership and documentation, and increase accountability for the development of the service and the quality of support for children and their whƒÅnau</li>
<li>establish more regular internal evaluation that enables HPS to make judgements about the effectiveness of the service</li>
<li>make HPS' appraisal more meaningful by keeping evidence of work towards professional goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>To improve current practice, the service manager should seek support to increase the rigour of performance management systems and to align HPS appraisal processes with Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.
