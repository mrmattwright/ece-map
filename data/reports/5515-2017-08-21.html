</table><p>The kindergarten needs further support to improve the quality of leadership and the quality of the programme and practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Elsie Street Kindergarten is located in Gore. The kindergarten is licensed for 45 children aged from two years to school age. Up to 40 children attend six hour sessions.</p><p>The kindergarten is led by a head teacher and five teachers, including two teachers who have been appointed since the last ERO review.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by Kindergartens South (KS). The kindergarten receives regular support from KS senior teachers. After the 2013 ERO review senior teachers supported the head teacher and teachers to develop action planning to address the key next steps in ERO's report. Since this time there has been limited progress on these next steps.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of fourteen kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kindergartens South).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide children with a variety of experiences, including a weekly outing for older children to experience nature in a local reserve. Children have opportunities to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop skills to be a friend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>join in active-movement programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn about their local community through outings and visitors to the kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are involved in a local cluster of schools and early childhood services to strengthen transitions to school. However, the formal transition to school programme at this kindergarten does not reflect current best practice.</p><p>Leadership has not been effective in sustaining progress since the 2013 ERO report. The 2013 ERO report identified that teachers needed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>be more intentional in their teaching by identifying the strategies they were going to use to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the impact the planned teaching strategies had on children's learning, for groups and individual children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO found that systems for planning, assessment and evaluation are not effective in promoting positive outcomes for children's learning. Planning does not support the provision of a rich curriculum. Documentation does not give sufficient guidance to teachers to intentionally plan for groups and individual children. Planning does not show how teachers respond to children's language, culture and identity.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified that the head teacher and teachers needed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identify key Māori concepts that are important to the kindergarten community and make these explicit in their philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO found that teachers have identified two important Māori concepts. However, planning to deepen the teachers' and children's understanding around these has not been sustained. Children experience some aspects of te ao Māori in the programme, such as waiata, a kindergarten whakapapa and some legends. The teachers need to develop planning to extend and enrich the bicultural programme and teaching practices.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified that the teaching team needed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen annual planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO found the kindergarten's vision to guide annual planning was not current and was in the process of being developed. The vision and the kindergarten philosophy need to be developed collaboratively with parents, and include their aspirations and expectations.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified that the teaching team needed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop their knowledge and use of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO found the head teacher and teachers do not have a good understanding of robust internal evaluation practices. They do not have evidence to show how well they have improved aspects of their practice. The head teacher needs to develop her own and teachers' understanding and use of effective internal evaluation to monitor and improve the programmes and practices they provide.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from ongoing and well-planned professional learning and development. A new appraisal system is being introduced. This needs to include expectations for observations and explicit links to Tātaiako. Specific goals to support leadership should be included within the process. </p><p>The kindergarten receives good support from Kindergartens South (KS). The KS board has a clear strategic vision that outlines key priorities for development. The next step is to ensure explicit alignment of these priorities to each kindergarten's long-term planning. The board has identified that internal-evaluation practice is not strong at board level. The board needs to receive evaluative reporting of how well these plans and other initiatives have been enacted and the impact on children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps to promote positive outcomes for all children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop leadership for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>find ways to work in collaboration with parents and whānau and reflect their aspirations and expectations within the philosophy, vision, and long and short-term planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop effective systems for planning, assessment and evaluation, and implement a rich curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop effective internal-evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The key next steps for the KS board are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the appraisal system continues to be developed and embedded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and use rigorous internal-evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure explicit alignment of kindergarten planning to implement the KS strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive evaluative reporting of progress towards the strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elsie Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><p>To improve current practice the kindergarten needs to strengthen risk-management plans for excursions.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Elsie Street Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson <br>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>21 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
