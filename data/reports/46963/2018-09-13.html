</table><p>Love Kids Home Based ECE Service needs support and guidance to build the capacity of visiting teachers and educators to deliver quality early childhood curriculum programmes in homes.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Love Kids Home Based ECE Service is a newly established, privately owned service with its head office in Mt Roskill. The service was licensed in 2016 for 30 children. Children enrolled in this service come from the West, East and Central Auckland.</p><p>The director/owner works with two visiting teachers to oversee the delivery of the curriculum by the educators, who provide education and care for up to two children in each of the homes. Most of the educators are children's family members, such as grandparents. All educators, visiting teachers and families are Chinese.</p><p>The service's vision is underpinned by a belief that children deserve to be loved and nurtured in order to learn. The service's philosophy promotes respectful, positive family and community connections and a safe environment for children. Assisting children to develop holistically at their own pace and in collaboration with whƒÅnau are priorities. Children's language and cultural identity are valued. There are well developed policies and systems to manage the growing demand for home based education and care in the Chinese community of greater Auckland.</p><p>This is the first report for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner is committed to early childhood education in home settings. Leaders place a high importance on and prioritise culture-based values and children's sense of belonging and wellbeing. Educators have developed very warm relationships and responsive interactions with children and families. Children express their interests and needs confidently.</p><p>Visiting teachers use their monthly visits to homes to monitor health and safety, and educator practices. They observe and record children's learning during their monthly visits and make these records available for parents to access online. However, these records could be more consistently used to identify children's interests and inform how their learning is to be extended. Educators' capacity to notice, recognise and respond accordingly, and visiting teachers' capability to support them, are areas for development.</p><p>Environments are well resourced and affirm children's language and identity as Chinese. They provide good indoor and outdoor spaces for children to play. A resource library is available for educators to access. More natural resources and strategies that incorporate bicultural and multicultural perspectives and activities would promote children's understanding of the cultures and environments of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Relevant professional learning has increased visiting teachers' professional knowledge. Educators now need support to build their capacity to understand the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. They also require support to plan and assess children's learning and to build children's independence and social confidence.</p><p>The service's commitment to acknowledging Te Tiriti o Waitangi is promoted through some use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, and excursions for children and their families. Parents' aspirations and perspectives are evident in the many forms of communication available to them. Parents are generally very positive about the care that their children receive.</p><p>The service has developed useful processes for evaluating the quality of visiting teachers' practice and to guide improvements. More robust evaluation of the quality of service provision would help the owner to identify future development priorities and contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of programmes for children.</p><p>Management systems include a vision that underpins the service's strategic direction, and policies and procedures that define expectations for staff. Mentors informally support visiting teachers to work towards gaining their full teachers' certificate. The director now needs to embed a robust performance management system and formal appraisal processes that meet Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director and visiting teachers agree that to improve practices they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>access relevant professional development to improve visiting teacher and educator practice in assessment, programme planning, and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a process for regularly developing and reviewing policies and procedures, that includes all stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote practices that incorporate bicultural and multicultural perspectives to ensure a more diverse curriculum that builds educator practices and provides more positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Love Kids Home Based ECE Service completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>effective performance management system, including a robust appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust internal evaluation to inform sustainable improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more effective planning, assessment and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional capability of visiting teachers and educators to deliver a quality curriculum programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, GMA 2, 3, 6, C4</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Love Kids Home Based ECE Service will be within two years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>13 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
