<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Tramway Playcentre is one of the twenty playcentres administered by the Southland Playcentre Association. Originally named Tisbury Playcentre, it was in recession and reopened at Tramway Road. It is operated by parent leaders and supported by a volunteer educator. It offers two morning sessions for parents and children from birth to five years of age. Parents must stay with children who are under two and a half years old.</p><p align="left">The playcentre is well organised and resourced. There has been good progress in developing the centre on its new site. It has a large outdoor area which is used to create a variety of challenges for physical play. Parent leaders are successfully building the centre roll on this new site.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from a safe and nurturing environment. Parents and their children are made to feel welcome and included. Positive and supportive relationships are evident between adults and children throughout the centre.</p><p align="left">Parent leaders focus strongly on developing all aspects of the centre. They seek and receive good support from key personnel within the Southland Playcentre Association. Parent leaders undertake playcentre parent education programmes.</p><p align="left">Parent leaders work well together to support the children&rsquo;s learning. They have made a good start in developing children&rsquo;s records of learning. They reflect and evaluate the quality of the programme for children to improve children&rsquo;s experiences.</p><p align="left">ERO noted the following features of the centre going particularly well. The:</p><ul>
<li>positive interactions between parents and children</li>
<li>focus and support provided to develop parents&rsquo; knowledge and skills</li>
<li>planning and evaluation of the centre programme</li>
<li>way in which tasks are shared and carried out</li>
<li>support and guidance provided through the Playcentre Association.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Centre leaders and ERO agree that the centre&rsquo;s next steps should include reviewing and developing:</p><ul>
<li>the bicultural dimension of the programme</li>
<li>the centre&rsquo;s philosophy</li>
<li>further opportunities for children to explore aspects of the world around them</li>
<li>planning for individual children&rsquo;s next learning steps.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s care and safety are being well managed at the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO report since 2006. This centre was formerly Tisbury Playcentre. Tramway Playcentre is on a new site. The centre has been refurbished and is run by new parents, families and a volunteer educator.</p><h4>Findings</h4><p>Focus on improvement. Parent leaders and the association are focused on improving the centre and outcomes for children. Parents are responsive to new ideas from the leaders. Systems are being developed to support continuous improvement. Children benefit from tailored professional learning for parents within and beyond the centre.</p><p>Assessment and portfolio development. Parent leaders are in the early stages of compiling records of children&rsquo;s learning. They capture children&rsquo;s interests and experiences. Records show parents are noticing and recording children&rsquo;s interests. Parents should consider how children could have easier access to their portfolios.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Interactions. Children benefit from positive and productive interactions throughout the centre. Children&rsquo;s behaviour is managed in positive ways. Parents feel welcomed by parent leaders. Children generally get along well with each other. Greetings and farewells are building children&rsquo;s sense of belonging to the centre.</p><p align="left">Planning and evaluation. Parent leaders use planning and evaluation approaches for children&rsquo;s learning. Goals for children and future support possibilities are recorded in planning webs. Children&rsquo;s goals are revisited at the end of session evaluations of the daily programme.</p><p align="left">Shared leadership. Parents are working well together as a team. They successfully share their roles and responsibilities. Children&rsquo;s interests and needs are communicated effectively. These factors are contributing to a cohesive, smooth running programme.</p><p align="left">Playcentre Association support. Personnel from the Playcentre Association are providing useful support and information for parents. This has included:</p><ul>
<li>some formats to help record children&rsquo;s daily learning</li>
<li>ongoing monitoring of aspects of centre operations</li>
<li>support to meet the 2008 ECE regulations</li>
<li>ideas to assist parents&rsquo; engagement with children.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Planning for individual children&rsquo;s next steps.It is not always clear how children&rsquo;s future learning is planned for in centre programmes. There could be a greater focus on planning and extending individual children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Bicultural dimension. There is scope to increase parents&rsquo; knowledge and confidence in the integration of bicultural elements into the centre&rsquo;s programme. Parents are receiving some support for this from an external liaison person. There is scope to increase children&rsquo;s awareness and understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage through programme planning and evaluations.</p><p align="left">Self review. It is time for parent leaders, with support from the Playcentre Association, to review and implement a local philosophy for the centre. Parent leaders should consider how well the centre programme provides for children to explore aspects of the world around them.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Tramway Playcentre completed an ERO Centre<span>Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

It offers two morning sessions for parents and children from birth to five years of age. Parents must stay with children who are under two and a half years old.</p><p align="left">The playcentre is well organised and resourced. There has been good progress in developing the centre on its new site. It has a large outdoor area which is used to create a variety of challenges for physical play. Parent leaders are successfully building the centre roll on this new site.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from a safe and nurturing environment. Parents and their children are made to feel welcome and included. Positive and supportive relationships are evident between adults and children throughout the centre.</p><p align="left">Parent leaders focus strongly on developing all aspects of the centre. They seek and receive good support from key personnel within the Southland Playcentre Association. Parent leaders undertake playcentre parent education programmes.</p><p align="left">Parent leaders work well together to support the children&rsquo;s learning. They have made a good start in developing children&rsquo;s records of learning. They reflect and evaluate the quality of the programme for children to improve children&rsquo;s experiences.</p><p align="left">ERO noted the following features of the centre going particularly well. The:</p><ul>
<li>positive interactions between parents and children</li>
<li>focus and support provided to develop parents&rsquo; knowledge and skills</li>
<li>planning and evaluation of the centre programme</li>
<li>way in which tasks are shared and carried out</li>
<li>support and guidance provided through the Playcentre Association.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Centre leaders and ERO agree that the centre&rsquo;s next steps should include reviewing and developing:</p><ul>
<li>the bicultural dimension of the programme</li>
<li>the centre&rsquo;s philosophy</li>
<li>further opportunities for children to explore aspects of the world around them</li>
<li>planning for individual children&rsquo;s next learning steps.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s care and safety are being well managed at the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
