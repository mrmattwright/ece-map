</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Panmure is licensed for 100 children including up to 25 children under the age of two years. Children may attend sessions (morning or afternoon) or full time. There are four separate rooms for different age groups; babies, and two, three and four year olds. The three older groups share a large outdoor play area.</p><p>The centre was purchased by Kidicorp at the end of 2013. The new centre premises were built in 2014. Kidicorp policies and procedures are now guiding centre operations. The centre manager, who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the centre, is supported by a professional services manager and a business manager who regularly visit the centre.</p><p>Children and staff reflect a wide range of ethnic groups. Several teachers speak the home languages of some children and their families. Twenty-two percent of children who attend the centre are MƒÅori and 27 percent are from Pacific cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre offers transport to and from the centre for some children who might otherwise not access early childhood education services.</p><p>Staff are well qualified and most teachers are registered. Two teachers are studying towards early childhood teaching qualifications.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report indicated that ERO would return to the centre in two years to evaluate the progress made in response to the report‚Äôs recommendations. ERO recommended that teachers be supported to build their teaching skills and strengthen the centre‚Äôs self review practices to improve outcomes for children. Good progress has been made in these areas with the support and guidance of Kidicorp managers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Supportive relationships are evident between teachers and children and among children. As a result children participate confidently in the programme and show a strong sense of belonging. Children communicate well and show respect for others and the environment. Teachers skilfully support children to develop social and self-help skills. Children enjoy playing in groups and many have developed friendships with other children at the centre.</p><p>Although children are grouped by age, children over two years of age are free to spend their time in any of the rooms apart from the babies‚Äô room. This helps with their transitions through the centre‚Äôs age-group rooms. Babies are well cared for. Teachers follow each child‚Äôs own feeding and sleeping routines. They often talk with infants and provide a stimulating range of accessible resources.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to participate in conversations and they respect their contributions. These conversations often guide children‚Äôs play and the projects they work on. Centre leaders could now support teachers to increase the level and complexity of the language used in these conversations. They could also further promote teachers‚Äô use of te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Children are well supported when they are new to the centre. Teachers have recently reviewed and improved the support that children and their families are given when children prepare to attend school. Centre staff recognise the importance of working in partnership with parents. They encourage parents to contribute ideas about the programme and to discuss their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The flexibility of the programme and the layout of the buildings and play areas support children to make choices about their play. Children have easy access to a wide range of resources. Wall displays support learning and teaching. The centre environment and celebrations reflects the cultures of the children who attend. The centre acknowledges MƒÅori as tangata whenua and has a commitment to bicultural New Zealand. Centre managers could now reflect this commitment in the centre‚Äôs philosophy statement.</p><p>Effective leadership and management systems guide centre operations and promote on-going improvement. Kidicorp has clear expectations for teaching and children‚Äôs education. Managers recognise that further discussion with staff is needed to ensure that policies and procedures are well understood and implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers‚Äô self review has identified appropriate priorities for development. Action plans are being developed and key staff are available to support improvement in these areas. These priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>assessing children‚Äôs learning to guide programme planning and extend children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>seeking parent aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning and supporting these aspirations in the programme</li>
<li>using appraisal processes effectively to promote teachers‚Äô professional development</li>
<li>building self-review practices to improve outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Panmure completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Panmure will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 October 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
