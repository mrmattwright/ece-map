</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leigh Community Pre-School continues to provide education and care for children from six months to five years of age. The centre is led by a committee consisting of three staff, and seven parent and community representatives. The management team includes a curriculum and teaching manager and a centre manager. As a result of staff changes over the last two years, at least half of the staff are new and all members of the management team are new.</p><p>The pre-school is licensed for 28 children with 39 on the roll at the time of this review. It offers sessional and full day care. The pre-school is adjacent to the local primary school. Children from the pre-school have access to the school’s facilities and centre managers have good connections with school staff who support children’s transition to school.</p><p>The pre-school has strong connections with its community and very good links to local whānau, hapū and iwi. All teaching staff are qualified. Since ERO’s 2012 review some teachers have specialised in working with children up to 2 years of age, and have accessed personal learning in te reo Māori.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended that staff extend their understanding and use of self-review. ERO also noted that managers should work in partnership with management to develop effective strategic planning.  During the 2015 review ERO found that these aspects of self-review and strategic planning have substantially improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive, sensitive and responsive interactions between staff and children are evident. Teachers know children and their families well. Respectful relationships and positive interactions support children to be confident and engage in their learning. Children’s affirming interactions with their peers and teachers during play helps promote a caring and supportive environment for children.</p><p>A significant feature of relationships between families and the centre is the ‘key teacher’ approach. An identified teacher keeps each family informed about their children’s care and learning. This enhances opportunities for ongoing and more in-depth communication about children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers and children use te reo Māori incidentally with confidence. Children sing waiata and know these songs well. They use Māori vocabulary in their conversations. Stories and the history of the local region and tangata whenua are identified in documentation and in the centre surroundings. The centre reflects the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand very well.</p><p>A sense of responsibility and self-confidence is evident in children’s behaviours. Children select their areas of play and are imaginative, creative and happy in their environment. They are free to play as individuals or in group situations and it is notable that children are encouraged to take care of one another.</p><p>The transition to school programme is well supported by the centre and local school staff. Parents support their children through participation in the programme, and through kapa haka.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations of their practice. They discuss children’s learning and think about ways to further support children’s learning. Teachers work collaboratively and make good use of children’s interests to guide their planning for play. Teachers discuss and evaluate children’s learning regularly during and after play sessions.</p><p>Managers have introduced a good process for appraisal. It is collaborative, evidence-based and complies with legislative requirements. The appraisal process incorporates the practicing teacher criteria, and the manager and mentor monitor appraisals to ensure they are rigorous and that improvement is sustained. The management team have a shared leadership approach to managing their responsibilities and priorities.</p><p>The inside and outside environments are well resourced. The outdoor area provides good opportunities to challenge children and provide them with a sense of adventure. Teachers are inventive in providing water play and this adds another dimension to children’s experience of the natural world. The inside area provides space where children engage in different activities. There is good flow and access from inside to outside.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teacher's next steps include considering ways to keep records of their discussions and thinking about children’s play on a daily basis. They should also further develop evaluation processes to identify the impact of programmes on children’s learning. This would be useful in identifying the extent to which they have added value to the programme for children over time. </p><p>Self-review continues to develop. The centre leaders acknowledge that self-review requires further improvement so that it more effectively covers and contributes to all aspects of centre development and management. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leigh Community Pre-School Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Leigh Community Pre-School Inc will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
