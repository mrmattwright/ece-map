</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pongakawa Playcentre is a long-established, parent-led early childhood service. It is situated south of Te Puke in the district of Pongakawa and adjacent to the local school. The centre buildings and grounds are spacious, attractive and well maintained. There are mature trees and an orchard for children to explore.</p><p>The centre is licensed to cater for 25 children including up to 13 children under the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review there were 22 children on the roll including 15 under two years and six children identified as being of MƒÅori descent. The centre operates three mixed-age, group-supervised morning sessions each week.</p><p>Pongakawa Playcentre operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association (WBOPPA). Centre members benefit from the support and guidance of an experienced centre liaison officer. The centre administration officer provided by the association also works on one session per week to meet qualification requirements. She provides valuable modelling and support for parents. WBOPPA also provide training workshops and useful documentation and frameworks to guide centre operations. These guidelines are underpinned by the association‚Äôs philosophy, which is highly evident in members‚Äô practice.</p><p>Centre members are engaging in different levels of training and are committed to learning alongside their children. They place priority on promoting children‚Äôs learning through play as happy, confident learners who can try new things in a safe and secure environment.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review centre members have worked effectively with the support of the association and federation to strengthen self review. Members have developed manageable systems and frameworks for planning and assessing children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Western Bay of Plenty Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate confidence and a strong sense of ownership as they play and learn alongside their friends. They have established trusting relationships with other adults. The mixed-age setting promotes opportunities for older children to be leaders and build their social skills as they interact with younger children and their siblings. Older children are sensitive and careful of infants and toddlers in the learning environment. They explore and make choices from a wide variety of interesting and open-ended equipment. Children have fun taking calculated risks and building their physical skills on appropriately challenging equipment. They express themselves creatively through art, music, writing and imaginative play.</p><p>Centre members prepare the environment well and provide interesting experiences that promote positive learning outcomes for children. Routines are flexible and responsive to the diverse needs and abilities of children and their families. Transitions are well planned and contribute to a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing amongst adults and children. The centre maintains close and reciprocal relationships with the local school.</p><p>Members enthusiastically share their knowledge of literacy, mathematical and scientific concepts as they work alongside children. Their diverse range of knowledge and experience enriches the programme. However, because of the differing levels of understanding parents have of mathematical learning, there would be benefit in members taking a more intentional approach to reviewing this area of the curriculum. Members provide continuity for learning between home and the centre through their ongoing involvement with the programme. They support children to revisit and share their learning through conversations, displays, children‚Äôs individual portfolios and by making books about centre events.</p><p>MƒÅori children have good opportunities to experience success as MƒÅori as they learn with and alongside their whƒÅnau. Te reo MƒÅori is increasingly used by centre members. Members benefit from another member sharing her knowledge and capability in the use of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori. Playcentre whƒÅnau recently prepared and shared a hangi with the wider community as part of Matariki celebrations. Children and their families have participated in kapahaka celebrations at the local school. They are increasing their understanding of New Zealand as a bicultural society.</p><p>Members build their understanding of centre operations and develop leadership skills as they participate in ongoing training and take responsibility for key roles to ensure smooth running of centre operations. This shared approach has established strong partnerships with families in the local and wider community. Centre leaders have implemented sound systems of collaborative self review and centre-wide planning, which contribute to ongoing centre sustainability, development and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that the next steps for Pongakawa Playcentre are to:</p><p>continue to strengthen programme planning by intentionally responding to children‚Äôs emerging learning and interests through the termly and end-of-session evaluations. Particular attention should be given to adding challenge and complexity to older children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>make greater use of guidelines, frameworks and indicators of best practice to inform self review</p><p>consider making greater use of <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to support members to more effectively document learning for infants, toddlers and young children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pongakawa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pongakawa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>27 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
