</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parkvale Kindergarten is located in Parkvale, Hastings and provides education and care for children from three to five years of age. It is licensed for up to 40 children and operates as a sessional kindergarten on an all day licence. The kindergarten has peer groupings, with four year olds able to attend five mornings a week and three year olds for three afternoons. A playgroup is held on Tuesday afternoons to facilitate transition into the larger group.</p><p>The four teachers are fully qualified and registered. They work well as a team to meet the needs of the children who come from a range of backgrounds. The programme is influenced by the aspirations parents and whānau have for their children. The kindergarten enriches its programme by taking advantage of the good links with the wider community.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two Education Managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The principles of Parkvale Kindergarten’s philosophy relate to the uniqueness of children, their interests and community collaboration. These elements are reflected in the programme. Teachers have begun a timely review of the philosophy, in consultation with the community, to be sure it meets the aspirations of the current children and community.</p><p>The kindergarten’s focus on “playing as good friends” is highly evident in this warm and supportive environment. Teachers model supportive relationships and positive interactions. They encourage children to explore and challenge themselves and to lead their own play.</p><p>Teachers recently attended a leadership conference and plan to reflect on the implications for them in their capacity as leaders. The next step is to put into practice the findings from the conference.</p><p>Teachers reflect on the daily programme and consider children’s strengths and interests in their ongoing planning. The next step is to more clearly document the kindergarten’s approach to planning and assessment to facilitate consistent practice.</p><p>The wide range of resources and the spacious physical environment support the stimulating and challenging programme. Partnerships with families are strong and valued. Children and their families display a sense of belonging in the kindergarten setting.</p><p>Through ongoing whānau consultation teachers plan to meet aspirations for Māori children. The importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is acknowledged through partnerships, policies and practices. This is an ongoing focus for development.</p><p>Routines are consistently implemented. These routines give children a sense of security and provide an opportunity for shared formal learning. Teachers engage children in constructive conversations and through astute questioning, facilitate language and numeracy development.</p><p>Transitions are well considered. Children from the playgroup may join the three-year-old afternoon session. The move to the morning session is well paced and is usually timed according to readiness rather than age. There are very good links to local schools and a well-established programme facilitates a smooth and successful transition.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to staff for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear, long-term direction for the association. Teachers are well supported through regular visits from the education managers who offer access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>There is a commitment by the association to increase teachers’ capabilities through the introduction of the Haere Whakamua project. This project is based around progressing the organisation's journey in becoming bicultural.</p><p>The association identify, and ERO affirms, that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>updating the appraisal process and policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing clear expectations through guiding documents for programme delivery and kindergarten operations and monitoring the implementation of these.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers and use this information to inform future decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that they should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and develop the statement of philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practise the learning gained from the leadership conference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>document procedures for assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend culturally responsive practices and strategies which support success for Māori as Māori and success for Pacific as Pacific.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should</p><ul>
<li>establish and review current guiding documents and monitor implementation</li>
<li>undertake strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parkvale Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Parkvale Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>24 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
