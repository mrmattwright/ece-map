</table><p>Oromahoe Kindergarten needs external support to review and improve many aspects of its operations.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oromahoe Kindergarten is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 25 children aged over two years. Younger children are cared for in the nursery, and transition through to the kindergarten room at around three years of age. All children share the outdoor play area.</p><p>Teaching practice follows the Rudolf Steiner philosophy. Play resources are unstructured and mainly from the natural world. Self-directed play forms the basis of the programme. Seasonal rhythms direct kindergarten routines.</p><p>The centre manager leads a team of two other qualified teachers and one teacher in training. The Bay of Islands Waldorf Education Trust, which currently consists of five members, provides governance support for the kindergarten. The centre manager and administrative assistant have taken on the Trust chairperson duties.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well cared for. On arrival, children are encouraged to settle into an activity set out by teachers, help prepare the food for morning tea, or access a limited range of resources and materials for their play.</p><p>Some children play together imaginatively in small groups with minimal teacher interaction. Teachers respond to children who ask for help or to promote respectful ways for children to interact with each other and the environment. During mealtimes and centre routines teachers foster children's self-help and independence skills.</p><p>Teachers need to consider how effectively their interactions with children prompt further, or more complex, thinking about their activities or play. They should also consider how they can align their philosophy and teaching practice with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and current understandings of high quality practices in an early learning environment.</p><p>The programme currently follows the winter rhythm. This means children play indoors until after lunch when they are all sent outdoors to play. There is no flow or ready access throughout the day between the indoor and outdoor areas. The routines and resourcing of the kindergarten do not empower children to make choices and participate in a wide range of enriching experiences that expand their confidence and competence over time.</p><p>Children's participation in the programme is captured in their 'Golden Books'. These records contain mostly group learning stories. The Steiner philosophy is shared in numerous entries linked to the programme. Teachers should more explicitly identify and respond to the learning interests, strengths and capabilities of individual children.</p><p>Literacy is included in the programme when teachers and children read together, through the storytelling routine, and in some other activities. The manager and teachers need to consider more ways to promote a language rich environment, including access to a diverse range of written texts, to support children's literacy learning at other times.</p><p>The purpose of internal evaluation is not fully understood or contributing to positive outcomes for children. A more in-depth review of bicultural practices could help teachers to develop deeper understandings of te ao Māori perspectives and how these could be woven through the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve current provision for children's learning, teachers need to fully implement the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and the requirements of the <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008</em>. Key next steps for managers and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plan, implement and evaluate an appropriate curriculum for children, based on their interests, strengths, abilities and needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen their bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a robust, ongoing process of internal evaluation to review of all aspects of centre operations, and how they promote positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to review the framework of policies and procedures to ensure documentation and practices meet with current legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oromahoe Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the kindergarten's curriculum. To meet requirements teachers must plan, implement and evaluate programmes that</p><ul>
<li>
<p>are based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respond to the learning interests, strengths and capabilities of enrolled children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflect an understanding of learning and development that is consistent with current research, theory, and practices in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a language rich environment that supports children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide children with a range of experiences and opportunities to enhance and extend their learning and development, both indoors and outdoors, individually and in groups.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1,3,7,8, 9,11,12; Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 43 (1a,b).</em></p><p>In order to improve current health and safety practices, managers and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish robust risk assessment and management practices and documentation for excursions outside the licensed premises</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-position objects in the playground that may enable children to climb over the fence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>place safe-fall material under tree stumps in the playground</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain accurate attendance records, including parent/whānau signatures and times of arrival and departure.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Oromahoe Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>8 September 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
