</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Planet Early Learning Centre is licensed to provide full day education and care for 83 children between six months and five years of age. Children are grouped according to their ages in two buildings. One building, the cottage, is for infants and young toddlers. The main building has covered decks and large rooms for the older two groups of children.</p><p>A small number of children have Māori heritage and another group are Chinese. There are also children from Pacific and other cultures. Teachers have a variety of cultural backgrounds that reflect the cultures of families. </p><p>Kids Planet Early Learning Centre operates as part of the Evolve Education Group. The Evolve organisation provides a policy and management framework and a range of support systems, to meet the needs of each service. Daily centre operations are delegated to the centre manager. Occasional cluster meetings with other Evolve centres provide a support network for centre leaders.</p><p>The centre manager has been in her position for six months. She has supported staff to develop a shared philosophy statement for the centre, and is promoting shared teaching and learning expectations.  </p><p>The centre has undergone significant changes since the 2014 ERO review. It has become part of Evolve Education Group. There have been several staff changes and the new manager has had the task of bringing teachers up-to-date with Evolve's curriculum expectations. This means that many processes and systems are still developing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews of services in the Evolve Education Group.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers welcome children and their families into the centre with warmth and affection. Children settle quickly to self-chosen activities, greet their friends with enthusiasm and chatter together. Teachers stay close to children, engaging them in talk. They are pleasant and positive with children, who are relaxed and trusting. Children understand the routines well.</p><p>Teachers have good and improving relationships with families. They actively seek parents' aspirations for children's future learning and encourage their input into the programme. Teachers are using an on-line communication tool to share information about children's learning. They have also increased opportunities for parents and children to share learning stories through portfolios. These books are still being developed to show children's progress over time. They are prized by children and their families.</p><p>The environment for infants and toddlers is calm and loving. Teachers follow aspects of the Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE) programme. They are respectful and quiet with children, talking to them about what they are doing and the next routines in the programme. They work alongside children, providing them with resources appropriate to their age and stage of development. The infants are confident and settled.</p><p>Teachers have identified that they could strengthen bicultural practices within the centre. They are undertaking a professional support programme to increase their understanding of te ao Māori and their use of te reo Māori with children. Their aim is to move away from using commands and to use words and sentences about what children are doing and what interests them. Teachers are gaining confidence in using te reo Māori with children.</p><p>Older children enjoy a programme in which teachers plan projects and events of interest. Shared planning based on teachers' observations of children's play is helping to strengthen teamwork. </p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments have been updated and refurbished. Teachers place a strong focus on natural resources. They note that aspects of Reggio Emilia practice have influenced their emphasis on respectful relationships, prompts for children's exploration, and tidy, open playing spaces. This is beginning to provide new opportunities for children's learning.</p><p>The Evolve Education Group is in a phase of continuing growth and development. A strategic vision and plan have been developed and provide a starting point for each centre's strategic planning. The organisation has a strong commitment to consultation with the community of each centre and to the professional development of staff and integration of bicultural practices throughout the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager agrees that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>building teachers' capacity to review and evaluate teaching and learning practices in order to improve positive learning outcomes for children and grow teaching practices</li>
<li>continuing to explore and build understanding of biculturalism through the professional development programme</li>
<li>building relationships in the community including with local schools. </li>
</ul><p>Evolve leaders recognise that they need to place a stronger focus on the quality of teaching in order to improve outcomes for children. They plan to clarify leadership roles and review systems for teachers' performance management.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Planet Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Planet Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>31 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
