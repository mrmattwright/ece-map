<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">The spacious and well maintained Kid&rsquo;s Planet Early Learning Centre No. 1 provides high quality early childhood education for children between the ages of two and five years. Situated in Albany&rsquo;s commercial area, this purpose-built centre is one of two privately owned centres on the same site. The adjacent centre caters for children up to the age of two. Parents speak appreciatively about the caring and friendly relationships between children, staff, parents and family/wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Children communicate confidently with their peers and with adults. They play collaboratively in pairs or in groups for sustained periods of time and enjoy learning. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s emotional and physical needs. The well organised indoor and outdoor areas provide stimulating and challenging learning experiences. Children have easy access to all learning areas and resources. Effective transition practices between the respective age groups enable children to settle quickly into new environments.</p><p align="left">Children guide the direction of the programme. Teachers are considering ways to better record and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They should now also consider strategies to extend the complexity of children&rsquo;s play. In addition, the manager and licensees agree that they should review how effectively they acknowledge the multicultural nature of the families who attend the centre. As part of this self review, they could identify strategies to better meet the needs and aspirations of M&#257;ori children and their families/wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s evaluation in April 2008, significant staff changes have occurred. The teaching team is now stable and staff work well together. The team is well led and is supported by centre managers. A professional development plan has been designed to increase whole-staff understanding and use of self review to enhance teaching practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kid's Planet Early Learning Centre No.1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKid's Planet Early Learning Centre No.1.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review, staff changes have included the appointment of a new manager and two team leaders in each of the two learning areas. The manager and licensees work closely together to guide and support the teaching team in providing high quality care and education for children.</p><p align="left">Children move from the Panda group into the older Kingfisher group when they are ready, at approximately three and a half years of age.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Relationships and interactions. Respectful and supportive relationships are clearly evident in the centre. Children are competent and confident communicators and active participants in the programme. They trust the adults and take a keen interest in other children, forming good friendships and interacting well together. Adults are responsive to children&rsquo;s needs and make good connections with children about their family life and home. Staff clearly enjoy working with children, and their collegial relationships have contributed to the supportive team culture.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. The centre provides a spacious and attractive learning environment for children. Play areas are well organised and invite children&rsquo;s exploration. The environment allows for good access and flow between internal and external areas. Children easily access the wide range of resources. They explore the learning environment with their peers and engage in extended periods of play.</p><p align="left">Physical challenge. The many opportunities provided for children&rsquo;s physical challenge are a special feature of the centre. Children take advantage of the large grassed area and resources and equipment that promote physical challenge and activity.</p><p align="left">Promoting independent learning. The programme effectively promotes the development of children&rsquo;s independent, self-help and social skills. Children persist at tasks and have many opportunities for sustained engagement in play. They interact well together, negotiate and take turns with resources and play equipment.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Centre managers, with the support of external expertise, have identified some areas for review and development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further developing teachers&rsquo; understanding and use of planning and assessment to ensure that children&rsquo;s individual strengths and interests are more clearly incorporated into programme planning; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">increasing staff understanding of self review as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness of the programme in relation to outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, centre managers and ERO discussed some additional areas for review and development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">providing children with more challenging and complex learning experiences in order to extend their learning; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">providing children with more opportunities for literacy and science within the context of their play.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Six M&#257;ori children are enrolled at this centre. Staff are beginning to develop their confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori during the programme, particularly at mat times. Some displays include translations into M&#257;ori, and have pictures to help children link words and images.</p><h4>Area of strength</h4><p align="left">Relationships. Centre staff have warm, respectful relationships with all families of children attending, including M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau. Children and their families/wh&#257;nau show a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p align="left">Self review and consultation. The manager and licensees agree that they could review the ways in which they demonstrate their understanding of, and the value they place on, the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau. By consulting with M&#257;ori families/wh&#257;nau, staff could enhance their partnership with parents and respond to the specific needs of parents and their aspirations for their children.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kid's Planet Early Learning Centre No.1 completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Situated in Albany&rsquo;s commercial area, this purpose-built centre is one of two privately owned centres on the same site. The adjacent centre caters for children up to the age of two. Parents speak appreciatively about the caring and friendly relationships between children, staff, parents and family/wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Children communicate confidently with their peers and with adults. They play collaboratively in pairs or in groups for sustained periods of time and enjoy learning. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s emotional and physical needs. The well organised indoor and outdoor areas provide stimulating and challenging learning experiences. Children have easy access to all learning areas and resources. Effective transition practices between the respective age groups enable children to settle quickly into new environments.</p><p align="left">Children guide the direction of the programme. Teachers are considering ways to better record and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They should now also consider strategies to extend the complexity of children&rsquo;s play. In addition, the manager and licensees agree that they should review how effectively they acknowledge the multicultural nature of the families who attend the centre. As part of this self review, they could identify strategies to better meet the needs and aspirations of M&#257;ori children and their families/wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s evaluation in April 2008, significant staff changes have occurred. The teaching team is now stable and staff work well together. The team is well led and is supported by centre managers. A professional development plan has been designed to increase whole-staff understanding and use of self review to enhance teaching practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
