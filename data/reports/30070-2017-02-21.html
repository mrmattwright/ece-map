</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens – Northwood operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT). The kindergarten is licensed to cater for 45 children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is open from 8.30am to 2.30pm and provides sessions from 8.30am to 11.30am, and 11.30am to 2.30pm, five days a week.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is to empower children to be positive, life-long learners through play. Leaders and teachers value resilience, teach and model empathy, and support children to be independent and capable learners.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review there have been some changes in the teaching team and some environmental improvements. Leaders and teachers are developing an appraisal system aligned to Central Kids requirements. The shared vision was reviewed and changed to, 'At Northwood Kindergarten the children are our focus'.</p><p>The centre is well-supported by the CNIKT. The trust’s strategic direction sets out the service’s vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki,</em> and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust works positively to provide equitable opportunities to families.</p><p>Compliance and regulatory requirements are well monitored by professional leaders. Policies and procedures ensure the kindergarten meets regulation requirements and management expectations. The professional leaders work alongside head teachers to support their leadership roles and provide guidance, and mentor teachers as part of the appraisal process. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development and to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>Personnel matters are well managed. The trust has undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal in consultation with teachers. This is enabling them to respond to the expectations of the Education Council and increase the depth of teachers’ reflections about their practice. The trust has also responded effectively to the Vulnerable Children’s Act, and has implemented the required changes to policies and practices for the protection of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Central Kids Kindergartens - Northwood and their families are warmly welcomed into spacious, well-planned and attractive learning environments. Children confidently interact with teachers, are actively engaged and have fun in their learning. They have access to well-equipped indoor and outdoor areas that support exploration, physical challenge and safe risk-taking. Children are well supported to find out about, and make sense of, the world around them.</p><p>Children learn and play in a positive, caring and responsive environment. They are developing competence in cooperative and collaborative play. Children are empowered to take increasing responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves and others. As a result, they develop friendships and interact constructively with others.</p><p>Teachers know children well and respond sensitively to their interests, strengths and needs. They effectively scaffold children's learning through a range of teaching strategies. Teachers encourage children's problem solving, critical thoughts, wonderings and creativity. Sustained, shared teaching extends children's thinking and values their contributions to learning. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into the programme through meaningful contexts. Children are very well supported to take responsibility for their learning and respond positively to new and challenging experiences.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers work in partnership with parents of children with special needs to improve and enhance their learning. Teachers are responsive to parent aspirations, and parents' and children's voices. They view each family and the knowledge of their children as an integral part of the kindergarten's learning community.</p><p>Ongoing observations of children in everyday activities builds a picture of what children know, feel, understand, are interested in and can do. Parents are well informed about children's learning and development through informal conversations and individual portfolios. Children's sense of belonging is effectively nurtured and supported during and after transition into the kindergarten and when moving to school.</p><p>The head teacher promotes a shared approach and common expectations among teachers about learning, teaching and behaviour. She has developed respectful, trusting relationships with staff, parents and whānau and promotes the right of all children to a quality, inclusive education. The head teacher shows a strong commitment to implementing the centre philosophy, vision and goals.</p><p>Teachers keep up-to-date with current theories of learning, teaching and developments through professional development, readings and discussion. They utilise opportunities to take leadership in areas of strength or interest. The developing appraisal system is promoting more meaningful reflection about teaching practice. A next step is to strengthen the process, focussing on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers evaluate the effectiveness of kindergarten activities and systems. Self review should be strengthened by increasing the focus on teaching practice and outcomes for children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the next steps are to:</p><p>Strengthen aspects of meaningful self-review including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly defining the purpose of internal evaluations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying shifts in practice that lead to improved outcomes for all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Build teachers' capacity to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>naturally integrate te reo Māori into the daily programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a bi-cultural assessment framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a culturally responsive curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre needs to continue to strengthen aspects of the appraisal process in order to more effectively develop teachers' capabilities and enhance children's learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Northwood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Northwood will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>21 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO’s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
