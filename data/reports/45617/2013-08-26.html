<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>The Stems From Home organisation was established in 2011 and has two networks. The first of these networks was fully licensed in November 2011, and the second became fully licensed in October 2012. Stems From Home operates in East Auckland between Maraetai and Howick/Pakuranga. It currently includes 35 educators, who provide for 93 children and their families.</p><p>One of the Stems From Home directors has responsibility for recruitment, management and liaison, both within the service and across the home-based care sector. The second director is one of two learning advisors, who are registered teachers. They provide support and guidance for in-home educators and have overall responsibility for the programmes for children.</p><p>The directors&rsquo; energy and commitment have enabled them to make significant progress in a short time. They are focused on providing a high quality service and developing a strong community of learners that includes children, parents and educators. They have high expectations of themselves and others in the organisation.</p><p>Effective communications and warm relationships contribute to the sense of belonging and ownership that children, families and educators have in the service. Children have opportunities to participate in a wide variety of learning experiences in homes, in the wider community, and as part of Stems From Home events and weekly gatherings. Parents/wh&#257;nau often participate in these occasions.</p><p>Management practices and systems for monitoring compliance and health and safety provisions are well established. Self review supports the directors&rsquo; commitment to ongoing improvement and continual professional learning. Key next steps to support this commitment include strengthening self review and continuing to develop processes for documenting planning and evaluation related to children&rsquo;s learning. Clearly establishing expectations for bicultural practice will help educators to foster children&rsquo;s awareness of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>In-home educators in the Stems From Home networks are supported by two learning advisers, who are registered early childhood teachers. They have overall responsibility for the quality of education provided for children. Several educators also hold early childhood education qualifications and most regularly attend Stems From Home workshops or other professional development opportunities. Each educator cares for up to four children and arrangements for this care are responsive to each family&rsquo;s requirements.</p><p>Areas of good performance</p><p>The Stems From Home philosophy and the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, are reflected well in learning advisers&rsquo; and educators&rsquo; practice.</p><p>The directors and learning advisers are focused on developing a high quality service for children and their families. They know families and educators very well, are responsive to their individual needs and value their strengths and the contributions that they make to Stems From Home. The directors and learning advisers balance professional practice and warm, caring personal relationships very well. They promote a sense of ownership for families and educators and nurture a sense of belonging for children.</p><p>Children benefit from close relationships with educators and other children in relaxed home environments. Infants and toddlers are particularly well catered for and children participate in a wide variety of learning experiences. They enjoy excursions in their local community, weekly playgroups, sports and movement programmes, and music sessions. Stems organises regular events and excursions for educators and children. Parents report that they appreciate these opportunities for their children to engage with a wider group.</p><p>Learning advisers visit educators, observe programmes and interact with children regularly. They work with educators to plan programmes in response to what they know about the children&rsquo;s interests. There are some very good examples of educators&rsquo; assessment and planning.</p><p>Parents value daily diaries that describe their children&rsquo;s learning activities. Children&rsquo;s portfolios contain photographs and stories, and link their learning to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Parents also comment on the value of electronic social media and communications, and their daily discussions with educators about their children&rsquo;s learning. There is a good sense of partnership between families, educators and Stems From Home in supporting children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The directors have a high level of commitment to building capacity in the Stems From Home organisation. Educators have varied levels of experience and skill and learning advisers provide practical and professional support for them to extend their learning. They note the positive impact of regular workshops on their work with children. More experienced educators make a positive contribution by mentoring those who are newer to formal early childhood education. Playgroup and other gatherings provide opportunities for educators to develop relationships, and to learn from and support each other.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Stems From Home directors and learning advisers agree that current practices could be enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the visibility of playgroup planning, evaluation and links to children&rsquo;s interests to extend learning and support more complex, child-initiated play</li>
<li>more streamlined record keeping that enables learning advisers to easily review each child&rsquo;s learning, and each educator&rsquo;s professional development progress</li>
<li>more formal, evidence-based and improvement focused evaluation of the overall quality of provision for children.</li>
</ul><p>These steps would help learning advisers and educators to evaluate outcomes for children and to continue fostering high quality provision for their learning.</p><p>The directors acknowledge that a key area for continued development is increasing the extent to which programmes include, and build knowledge and understanding of, te reo and te Ao M&#257;ori. The Stems From Home philosophy includes a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This statement could now be supported by a policy and indications of how this aspect of the curriculum will be implemented. Some educators have good levels of understanding and ability in this area and could provide support for others to increase their knowledge and confidence.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Stems From Home completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
