We work with early childhood services to identify their strengths and the areas they need to review and develop. Early childhood services take part in the review process and are expected to make use of the findings to enhance children's learning and wellbeing.</p><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Edmonton Community Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Context</h4><p>The Edmonton Community Kindergarten is a non-profit organization offering morning, afternoon and all day sessions for children from two to five years of age. The kindergarten is managed by a committee of parents and teachers dedicated to ensuring the sound operation of the centre.</p><p>All teachers are registered. They have worked together for several years. They place priority on providing a safe and stimulating environment where children learn in a programme guided by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Teachers believe that children should have equitable opportunities to learn and develop a love of learning at their own pace.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO review the centre has been relicensed under the 2008 licensing criteria and provides 20 hours of free early childhood education for children who qualify. Areas of strength</p><p>Teachers work closely with children to support them in their play. They respond positively to children, affirming their efforts and taking an active interest in what they are doing. Teachers encourage children to explore ideas and to develop their own questions to investigate. They promote children&rsquo;s inquiry through discussion. Teachers provide good and varied opportunities for children to learn early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge. Te reo M&#257;ori is appropriately integrated into all aspects of the programme.</p><p>The centre environment and resources are well maintained and well organised. Resources are age appropriate and accessible. Outdoor playing surfaces have been improved to allow all weather use and a playhouse has been constructed to extend play opportunities. The large outdoor area encourages children to be physically active. Further development of gardens and trees is planned in order to promote environmental sustainability.</p><p>A collaborative and inclusive approach to leadership ensures that all teachers are part of the decision-making process. Teachers work well as a team and with the management committee.</p><p>Regular meetings ensure that the centre runs smoothly. Reflective practices and strategic thinking guide improvements. Leaders have identified the need to strengthen self-review practices and have undertaken relevant professional development.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is discussed by all teachers at planning and assessment meetings. Teachers record key ideas about children to inform their programme planning. Significant learning is recorded in children&rsquo;s individual portfolios, which are regularly updated with new information.</p><p>Teachers work well in partnership with parents. Parents report that they feel welcome at the centre and sometimes stay for part of the session. They are kept well informed about the programme and about good early childhood education practices. Parents are consulted and teachers are responsive to parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>Teachers have reflected on the extent to which the kindergarten meets the needs of their community. They have received positive feedback from parents of M&#257;ori children on their bicultural approaches. Parents value the inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori and some aspects of M&#257;ori tikanga within the programme and the environment.</p><p>Teachers are aware of the increased cultural diversity in their community. They have begun to develop strategies for improving communication with children and their families who speak languages other than English at home.</p><p>During the review, centre leaders and ERO agreed that next steps for the kindergarten included:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self-review practices</li>
<li>continuing to develop the programme in ways that are responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests</li>
<li>strengthening performance management practices so that teacher and centre goals are clearly communicated and worked towards in collaborative ways</li>
<li>strengthening planning for excursions outside the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edmonton Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>29 October 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>Review focus</h4><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h4>Disclaimer</h4><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
