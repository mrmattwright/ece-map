</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kinderen (A) Daycare Centre is situated near the central business district of New Plymouth. It is one of two privately-owned early childhood services operated by the same management and governance team. The centre provides education and care for up to twenty one infants and toddlers for five days a week. Six MƒÅori and two Pacific children are enrolled.</p><p>Reorganisation of the leadership in 2014 resulted in the internal promotion of a new centre manager. The current team leader was appointed at the beginning of 2015.</p><p>The January 2013 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included developing teachers' shared understanding of expectations for centre teaching practice and self review. Progress in these areas is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers have space and time to explore their environment and are confidently engaged in learning about their natural, physical and social worlds. Teachers sensitively respond to children's non-verbal and verbal cues. Their rich interactions successfully support oral language development. Literacy and numeracy are meaningfully woven through learning experiences. Children's independence, resilience and problem solving are purposefully promoted.</p><p>A termly focus on aspects of te ao MƒÅori provides a useful basis for planning. In addition, teachers identify and purposefully respond to infants' and toddlers' interests. Evaluation should be developed to determine how effectively teachers' strategies, and the planned programme, are promoting children's learning.</p><p>Regular entries in the online profiles provide worthwhile information about children's engagement in the programme and developing sense of identity. The online environment is promoting parents' contribution to children's learning. Key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regularly gather parents' aspirations for their child's learning and reflect these in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more consistently show children's learning and progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children's cultures and home languages are valued and supported. Aspects of ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are integrated throughout the curriculum and some te reo MƒÅori is used at routine times. Teachers are engaged in ongoing professional learning and development to build their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori and competence in te reo MƒÅori. This should enable them to further embed bi-cultural practices and be more responsive to MƒÅori learners.</p><p>There is a clear and established process for appraisal. This has been strengthened to link teachers' goals to the Practising Teacher Criteria and centre priorities. The approach should be further improved through:</p><p>including formal observations of teachers' practice</p><p>professional feedback which considers the impact of teaching on outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Regular review is effectively informing changes in routines and processes. The teaching team has recently reviewed the centre philosophy in order to develop shared understandings about practice. Key next steps should include clarifying the purpose and process of internal evaluation. This approach should then be used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of practice.</p><p>The centre manager promotes ongoing professional learning for herself, leaders and teachers. She is developing a more collaborative decision making process to bring about centre wide improvements. Strategic documentation supports consistency of procedures and ongoing development. These processes should be further enhanced through a clearer focus on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice and the promotion of educational success for MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderen (A) Daycare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kinderen (A) Daycare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
