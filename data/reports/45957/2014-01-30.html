</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre will require considerable support from Kidicorp to address ERO‚Äôs recommendations. Kidicorp has the capacity to provide this. With appropriate support the centre will be well placed.</p><p>Edukids Elles Road opened in July 2012. The spacious purpose-built centre is divided into three classrooms. These include a nursery for infants and toddlers, a preschool room for children aged two to three and a half years and a ‚Äòprep‚Äô room for older children. There are two large outdoor areas.</p><p>Since the centre opened its roll has grown rapidly. The large staff is made up of a mixture of untrained, in-training, provisionally and fully-registered teachers. Since opening there have been some changes in staffing, including two of the three head teachers.</p><p>A centre manager oversees the centre and a head teacher is responsible for each room. The centre is owned and managed by the Kidicorp company. A regional business manager has worked alongside the centre manager. After a long vacancy, a professional services manager has been appointed to oversee professional support for teachers in this and other Kidicorp centres.</p><p>Children come from a wide range of different family backgrounds. About 10% of the children and some of the teachers are from overseas. Almost 25% of the children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, including infants and toddlers, settle quickly on arrival. Teachers take time to hold and show affection towards the infants. Teachers notice their care needs and respond to these.</p><p>On arrival at the centre, older children confidently approach their teachers and other children. They play well alongside and with each other. Over time, many have developed friendships with other children at the centre.</p><p>In each room there are well-established routines. These routines give each day a predictable structure and give children a sense of security. Resources are well-organised, attractively displayed, and easy for children to access.</p><p>Teachers and the centre manager take time to talk with parents about their children. They find out about the different cultural backgrounds of children and the cultural practices that their families see as important. Teachers try to be respectful of these preferences.</p><p>Within each room teachers communicate well with each other about children‚Äôs care needs and what they are doing. Teachers‚Äô interactions with children are generally friendly and supportive.</p><p>The programmes in each room are mostly child centred and responsive to children‚Äôs interests and dispositions.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profiles are attractively presented. They include frequent learning stories about children‚Äôs involvement in activities, their physical and social development, interests and emerging friendships. Increasingly, teachers discuss individual children‚Äôs learning and record this.</p><p>Given the newness of the centre, teachers are in the early stages of planning how they support children and families as they prepare to move on to school. The centre is beginning to develop relationships with local schools and resources for parents and children to help them in this transition.</p><p>The rapid growth of the centre has required the manager to spend considerable time appointing staff and enrolling new families.</p><p>The centre manager meets regularly with the Kidicorp business and professional managers and is now feeling better supported.</p><p>Kidicorp has useful policies, procedures and guidelines. These set out clear expectations for centre operations. Staff appraisal is being implemented and a Kidicorp Quality Education and Care audit is underway.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Most of the teachers are untrained, in training or in the early stages of their teaching career. Due to the rapid growth of the centre and a long period with no professional support person, teachers have not had sufficient guidance and professional learning opportunities. It is critical that Kidicorp ensures that the teachers, especially provisionally-registered teachers, have adequate support.</p><p>Teachers need support to improve how they:</p><ul>
<li>use routines like kai time, and other interactions with children, as opportunities to enrich children‚Äôs language</li>
<li>use intentional teaching strategies to extend children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>document how they will support children‚Äôs early literacy and numeracy development</li>
<li>integrate te reo MƒÅori and aspects of MƒÅori culture in centre</li>
<li>recognise and celebrate children‚Äôs different cultural backgrounds.</li>
</ul><p>It is also timely for the centre manager and staff to:</p><ul>
<li>review how well aspects of the centre philosophy are implemented such as how well teachers encourage children to be independent</li>
<li>explore recent research about best practice in the education and care of infants and toddlers and then review their own practices against this</li>
<li>introduce in-depth reviews of the different ways the centre supports children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>When writing learning stories, teachers need to make use of parents‚Äô wishes about their children‚Äôs learning and then show how they respond to these. Learning stories need to focus more on children‚Äôs learning. They also need to show what strategies teachers have or will use to challenge children and add complexity to their learning.</p><p>Teachers need to come to a shared understanding of how to plan small and large-group learning. This planning needs to clearly show the strategies teachers will use to extend children‚Äôs learning. Teachers also need to regularly evaluate the impact of their programmes.</p><p>The appraisal process needs to be strengthened. This should include teachers setting and being appraised against specific goals, and observations of teachers as they work.</p><p>The managers and ERO have identified that the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plans need to more clearly reflect the centre‚Äôs priorities. Managers should also work with teachers to improve their understanding of effective self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Elles Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Elles Rd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>30 January 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
