<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Te Aria Toka ki te Whakatohea preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Aria Toka ki te Whakatohea preschool is situated in Opotiki and provides education and care for 40 children, including 10 under two years of age. Recently two areas of the preschool have been merged to encourage increased manaakitanga and whanaungatanga for the older children. Since the previous ERO review in 2009, a new manager has been appointed and the teaching team restructured to encourage staff to take on leadership opportunities. Significant progress has been made in providing children with ready access to a good range of high-quality materials and equipment. Teachers have participated in whole staff professional development with a focus on further developing quality teaching practice. Recent self review has resulted in improved assessment and planning with a focus on extending children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers are well qualified. The centre aims to provide a quality educational experience where children&rsquo;s choices and values are respected and enhanced through the curriculum. The centre is governed by the Whakatohea Trust which provides strategic direction and responsibility for appointing staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Whakatohea Trust board and centre leaders, in consultation with wh&#257;nau and the community, are providing effective governance and management of the service. They have developed a shared philosophy, vision and goals that reflect the aspirations that the Whakatohea Trust board and wh&#257;nau have for their children. The centre vision places high priority on realising the potential of tamariki and their wh&#257;nau, and this is evident in centre practices. There are clear frameworks and guidelines for managing centre operations. Policies set out explicit expectations and guidance for teachers to implement a bicultural curriculum. Regular and ongoing professional development is sought by centre leaders and self review is effectively used to improve and develop the service. ERO and trustees agree that there would be benefit in developing a 5 year maintenance plan to enhance the physical environment of the centre and ensure professional working spaces for teachers and children.</p><p>Centre leadership maintains a focus on building emergent leadership and capability within the service to promote positive outcomes for children. The educational group manager provides ongoing support for the centre manager and teachers in professional development, with a focus on leadership and meeting the intent of the strategic priorities set for 2013.</p><p>A deep understanding of Te Ao M&#257;ori and Whakatoheatanga lies at the heart of this service. Leaders understand wh&#257;nau aspirations and expectations, and work collaboratively and responsively to achieve them. Children are first and foremost valued for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Trustees and leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that further encouraging and empowering parents as partners in decision making and their children&rsquo;s learning would enhance learning opportunities for children. The centre manager has identified an area for growth as continuing to develop teachers&rsquo; understanding of self review and reflection to improve and develop practice. An area under review is the performance management system and the development of shared and agreed indicators of best practice for evaluating teaching practice and providing feedback for teachers.</p><p>The curriculum is well designed to promote positive and holistic outcomes for children and their wh&#257;nau. Leaders and teachers acknowledge whakapapa as integral to the curriculum. The centre has a focus on a child-centred emergent curriculum based on identified interests. Strong responsive, reciprocal relationships amongst children, wh&#257;nau and teachers are highly evident and support children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and well being. There are many opportunities for children and wh&#257;nau to explore the wider community and visit places of interest to extend their knowledge. Literacy and numeracy are meaningfully integrated into children&rsquo;s play. Routines are flexible and foster children&rsquo;s independence. Children&rsquo;s leadership and social skills are encouraged and developed. Te reo me ona tikanga M&#257;ori is evident and woven through learning and excursions.</p><p>Teachers record aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and development in attractively presented profile books that are accessible to children and their families. The centre manager and supervisor agreed with ERO that teachers should continue to provide stimulating play to cater for active learners. There are many opportunities for children to explore, make choices and experiment. It was also agreed that displaying curriculum books for parents and children to share together would further enhance the curriculum.</p><p>Teaching and learning practices are promoting positive outcomes for children. Teachers value and acknowledge children&rsquo;s place as part of the wider family/wh&#257;nau and iwi and are welcoming to all children, their parents and wh&#257;nau. A planned environment is provided by teachers to stimulate children and to explore and investigate. Teachers work alongside children to sustain their play and extend their interests. There are many opportunities for children to learn and teach in the spirit of ako, and to have fun together as they learn. Some teachers model skilful conversations and activities with children that develop their early literacy and numeracy concepts.</p><p>It was agreed by centre management and ERO that the centre should continue to develop a shared and agreed understanding about curriculum delivery, assessment, teaching practice and distributive leadership among centre leaders and teachers.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Aria Toka ki te Whakatohea completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
