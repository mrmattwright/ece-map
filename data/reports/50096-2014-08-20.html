</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Shaken Oak Montessori, in Feilding, is a privately owned Montessori early childhood centre. It is licensed to cater for 41 children, including five aged up to two years.</p><p>The owner/service provider is responsible for managing the centre and leading teaching and learning.</p><p>Changes since the August 2011 ERO report include re-licensing, and the addition of a purpose-built facility to cater for the youngest children attending. This opened in Term 2, 2014 and was in response to the centre’s community wanting education and care for this age group.</p><p>Shaken Oak has been one of twelve Montessori services involved in a pilot programme: Te Ara ki Huhutanga, the Montessori Journey to Excellence. This is being undertaken by the Montessori Association of New Zealand in partnership with Massey University.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's programmes of learning for children appropriately reflect the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and the clearly defined Montessori Curriculum framework.</p><p>A strong emphasis on self discovery, and learning of literacy and mathematical skills and knowledge is evident. This is likely to support children well as they move on from the centre to learning within the school curriculum.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified strengths in the centre's assessment practice. There were positive and productive relationships between children and with adults. The report also highlighted a calm and purposeful physical environment and the successful use of resources and activities that support children’s learning. This ERO evaluation confirms that these good practices have been sustained.</p><p>Children demonstrate a sense of belonging, wellbeing and confidence, cooperative skills and respectful interactions. Their independence is encouraged. The centre's Montessori philosophy is evident in practice.</p><p>The service’s youngest children are very well catered for by a team who support their developing language and encourage their active exploration of the equipment and activities that are available.</p><p>The learning spaces for younger and older children are adjacent. At times, children are encouraged and supported to move between the two areas. Older children share their expertise with and nurture those who are younger, as they make new discoveries.</p><p>Centre personnel acknowledge the value to them of the pilot programme: Te Ara ki Huhutanga, the Montessori Journey to Excellence. As the resulting new learning is fully implemented, and associated teaching as inquiry and knowledge building practices are further developed, centre leaders should be better placed to: plan for and review curriculum developments; sustain ongoing improvement; and evaluate outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders with delegated responsibility for performance management, including supervision of provisionally registered teachers and appraisal, should undertake training to assist them to improve the quality and rigour of these processes, as they continue implementation of the centre's new appraisal framework.</p><p>Some appropriate processes for reflection and review are being used or explored, particularly to inquire into practice and respond to opportunities for change as they arise. A timetable for more formal and regular self review of centre policies, procedures and practices is not in place to support ongoing development in the service’s operation.</p><p>Review of how well te ao Māori is included in the centre curriculum to support success for Māori learners, as Māori remains a priority, as at the time of the previous ERO review. To progress work in this area with greater urgency leaders and teaching staff should consider:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ka Hikitia:</em> <em>Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> and how the competencies might further inform appraisal and attestation against the New Zealand Teachers Council Registered Teacher Criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Including goals that reflect the aspirations for their children of the hapū, iwi and whānau of Māori learners, across centre planning and self-review processes, should provide a good basis for ongoing improvement in learning outcomes for Māori and all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Shaken Oak Montessori completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, centre governance and management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>have in place a process for reviewing and evaluating the service’s operation, including showing timelines for planned reviews of different areas of operation<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em> [GMA6: An ongoing process of self review helps the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the quality and rigour of performance management practices, and ensure full completion of the appraisal process annually.<em> Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em> [GMA7: Suitable human resource management practices are implemented]</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Shaken Oak Montessori will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>20 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><ul>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
