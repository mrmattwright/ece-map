</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Springs Community Early Learning Centre is a community-based childcare centre that is managed by a parent representative committee. The centre provides all day education and care for children from birth to school age in separate nursery and preschool areas. The centre is licensed for a maximum of 35 children. Children come from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The teaching team is all qualified and registered early childhood teachers who have been at the centre for a number of years.</p><p>The centre is purpose-built, well maintained and attractively presented. It provides easy access for children to move freely between areas. There have been significant improvements to aspects of the outdoor areas with considerable support from whƒÅnau and the community.</p><p>There has been an ongoing focus on developing and extending sustainable practices, which includes centre vegetable gardens. The produce is shared with children and their families.</p><p>Since the November 2010 ERO review, good progress has been made in updating policies and procedures. Teachers have made improvements to the way they record in-depth self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children play cooperatively with each other and relate well to adults. Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and learning. They involve children in learning conversations that extend their thinking. Teachers use a variety of ways to support children‚Äôs independence and problem solving. They have strong links with the community and make good use of people‚Äôs skills and trips within the local area to extend children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to make decisions about their own learning and to take responsibility for setting up activities to develop their own interests. Children choose from a wide range of creative learning activities and opportunities. ERO observed children engaged in creative play for long periods.</p><p>Young children in the nursery have close, caring relationships with individual teachers. Teachers are respectful and flexible in the way they work with children and pace activities and routines to best meet children‚Äôs stages of development and readiness. Children are very well supported as they move into the over two area.</p><p>MƒÅori children have many opportunities to learn about their culture. All children learn their own mihi and regularly participate in the centre‚Äôs kapa haka. Teachers include te reo MƒÅori regularly in conversations with children and each other. WhƒÅnau are encouraged to participate in learning activities and share their knowledge and expertise with staff and children. Teachers have been involved in a long-term review of bicultural practices. As a result they have extended their understanding of practices that best support MƒÅori children sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Pasifika children‚Äôs cultures are acknowledged and clearly included in the learning environments and programmes. Teachers have close relationships with Pasifika families. They regularly encourage open communication and seek feedback about children‚Äôs learning and culture. Parents share aspects of their cultures with teachers and children.</p><p>Teachers work cooperatively together. Supervisors identify individual teacher strengths and use these well to support children and staff development. Teachers have a shared philosophy and understanding of best ways to support children‚Äôs learning. They are reflective and regularly discuss children‚Äôs needs and ways to improve centre practices and programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There are examples of good quality assessments of children‚Äôs learning. However, the next steps for supervisors are to ensure that all children‚Äôs learning stories are of a consistent quality. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>clearly identifying children‚Äôs learning and development</li>
<li>specific ways teachers will extend children‚Äôs development</li>
<li>making links with previous learning stories to show the progress children are making.</li>
</ul><p>The centre has had an ongoing focus on developing self-review practices. Teachers have undertaken a lengthy self review that provides a good example for future reviews. The supervisors and teachers now need to extend self review practices. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a format and process for spontaneous self review</li>
<li>increasing the frequency of formal reviews and linking these to the centre‚Äôs annual plan</li>
<li>reviewing some aspects of kai time routines for young children</li>
<li>aligning the strategic plan with the annual plan to ensure a greater focus on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The appraisal process for teachers needs to be strengthened. Supervisors should regularly provide teachers with formal feedback and clear next steps to extend their teaching and learning practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Springs Community Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Springs Community Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
