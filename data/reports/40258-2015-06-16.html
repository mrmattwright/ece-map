</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Tree House Private Kindergarten is a privately owned early childhood education service located in suburban Tauranga. The service is licensed for 25 children from 2 years to school age. At the time of this ERO review there were 21 children enrolled, one of whom identifies as MƒÅori. The service operates from 8.30am-2.30pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning the centre is based on:</p><ul>
<li>an ethos of aesthetic excellence in the environment</li>
<li>high expectations for teachers and children</li>
<li>a sense of harmony and peace</li>
<li>an underlying believe in respect</li>
<li>high quality resources and equipment.</li>
</ul><p>Parents interviewed by ERO speak with confidence about the centre philosophy and the reasons for choosing the service for the education and care of their children.</p><p>The owner/director oversees the daily operations of the centre and maintains close contact with teachers, families and children. Most of the teachers are long serving and have a recognised early childhood education qualification. The centre provides healthy morning teas and children bring their own lunch. Since the last ERO review in 2012, processes for teacher appraisal have been reviewed to include consideration of the Registered Teachers Criteria.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner/director provides strong and visionary leadership and direction for teachers and families. She is highly respected by teachers who appreciate her collaborative, approachable style and her dedication to the centre philosophy. Parents interviewed by ERO are highly supportive of her contribution to their child‚Äôs education and care. She is responsive to parents‚Äô aspirations and issues, and questions about their child‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The programme of education and care reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and is planned to embrace children‚Äôs interests and strengths. The daily programme consists of an appropriate balance of child-initiated and teacher-led learning experiences. There is a particular focus on the visual arts, environmental sustainability, and the use of natural resources. Teachers specifically integrate literacy and mathematical concepts throughout each day to extend children‚Äôs ability in these core curriculum areas. In addition, there are high quality opportunities for children to experience creative activities such as music, dance, art and drama.</p><p>There is a strong focus on developing children‚Äôs social skills and respectful relationships. Children are trusted and respected as competent learners. This is demonstrated through the availability and use of resources such as china cups and silver. The service environment and programme is very inclusive of children with high learning and developmental needs.</p><p>Routines such as morning tea and mat times are used to promote learning about social conventions such as sharing, hygienic practice and good manners. Other skills purposefully fostered include important aspects of being part of a group, respectfully listening, turn-taking, being an audience and performing. Excursions are purposefully planned to build on the centre programme and extend learning in relevant contexts and environments. The deliberate promotion of learning behaviours such as perseverance, listening to and following instructions, and completing a task to their satisfaction provides children with a sound foundation for life-long learning.</p><p>Individual child portfolios are available in a comfortable setting for parents and children to formally share and celebrate their child‚Äôs development and successes in learning. These useful documents contain a selection of narratives, work samples, and photographs that are appropriately focused on each child‚Äôs successes and developing social competencies.</p><p>The environment enables children to explore and have access to plentiful resources and inviting learning spaces (indoors and outdoors). Displays and learning areas are planned intentionally to invite children‚Äôs curiosity and challenge their ideas. Children are happily involved in exploring their environment and communicating with peers and teachers. Teachers ensure that the environment is set up to provide calm and ordered spaces, which enable all children to demonstrate competence and engage in activities for sustained periods of play and learning.</p><p>Teachers welcome parents and families warmly in to the centre. The service maintains small group sizes and this enables teachers to get to know children and their families well. Teachers include parents in regular discussions about children‚Äôs emerging interests and wellbeing.</p><p>Relationships among children and teachers are respectful and responsive to children‚Äôs need for education and nurturing care. Teachers skilfully notice opportunities to engage with children and extend their oral language and ideas, and this promotes a responsive and unhurried approach to learning.</p><p>The centre philosophy forms the basis for systematic review of all aspects of centre operations including resourcing, teacher professional learning, programme planning and organisation. There is good evidence that self review is leading to enhanced outcomes for children, and serving the dual purpose of centre improvement and accountability with regulatory requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner/director agree that it is important to review the centre philosophy, programme and practice to clearly reflect a commitment to the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Treehouse Private Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Treehouse Private Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
