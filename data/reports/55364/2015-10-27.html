</table><p>The lack of leadership in 2015 has impacted negatively on sustainability and improvements to the quality of teacher practices and curriculum. Many aspects of practice are still in the early stages of development.</p><p>Managers acknowledge the lack of progress in key areas and the impact of insufficient leadership in the centre. The appointment of a centre manager is an important step to ensuring improvements to curriculum, practice and centre operations.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori@Rongotai provides early childhood education and care for up to 29 children between the ages of two and five years. The Montessori philosophy with the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, informs programmes, practices and resources. Daily sessions are offered five days a week.</p><p>The service is owned by BestStart Educare Limited. They provide the governance, management and strategic direction for this centre. A professional service manager (PSM) and business manager provide curriculum and business support for teachers and leaders.</p><p>Teachers are fully qualified and two are Montessori trained. A centre manager has recently been appointed after an extended period without anyone in this position.</p><p>Areas for improvement identified in the January 2013 ERO report included self review, responding to whƒÅnau aspirations, and the curriculum. Limited progress has been made in addressing these areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers endeavour to weave the Montessori philosophy and the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> into the curriculum. Children experience warm and respectful relationships from kind and caring teachers. The curriculum enables them to have a choice in their play and includes excursions into the community.</p><p>Rich, descriptive language is used by teachers to support children's oral language development. Families and whƒÅnau are encouraged be actively involved in their child‚Äôs learning by spending time at the centre and to use their home language. Teachers work hard to develop and sustain relationships with parents to support their child‚Äôs learning.</p><p>There is a process in place to help support children and their parents for transitioning into school. Leaders have identified that they need to develop relationships with local schools to support the sharing of information about children at this centre.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is developing. Teachers and leaders have indentified the need to use <em>TƒÅtaiako, Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>, to help improve and support their practice for working with MƒÅori children. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><p>Teachers and leaders have identified the need to engage with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and the Pacific community to develop their understanding of what success looks like for MƒÅori and Pacific children. This should help teachers to celebrate and be responsive to children's culture, language and identity.</p><p>The services curriculum, assessment and teaching and learning practices require improvement to better support children's engagement and learning. Priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>leaders providing sufficient support for teachers to effectively integrate the Montessori philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> curriculum</li>
<li>collaboratively determining the curriculum design and establishing priorities for children's learning</li>
<li>identifying the teaching practices required and enacting these would provide a firmer foundation for improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation practices require improvement and would be enhanced if priorities for children's learning were established. Teachers, through this process, should show how they have:</p><ul>
<li>responded to children's identified interests and learning</li>
<li>added challenge, complexity and progress to children's learning</li>
<li>used this information to inform the day-to-day curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Changes and improvements to curriculum and assessment practices should be regularly monitored and evaluated to support continuous improvements to practice.</p><p>Self review is at the very early stage of development. The PSM needs to continue to work with teachers to promote their understanding and use of self review to help improve practice. The service has an effective appraisal system that aligns to the Practising Teacher Criteria in place to support, develop and measure teacher‚Äôs performance.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified priorities for urgent attention include:</p><ul>
<li>improving curriculum, assessment and teaching and learning practices</li>
<li>strengthening the bicultural programme</li>
<li>defining MƒÅori and Pacific success</li>
<li>implementing self-review processes to support ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori@Rongotai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the curriculum and self review. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum should be consistent with the prescribed curriculum framework and informed by assessment planning and evaluation that demonstrates children's learning, their interests, whƒÅnau, and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an ongoing process of self review that helps the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1, C2, GMA 6]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Montessori@Rongotai will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
