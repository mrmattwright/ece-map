</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Manurewa provides education and care for children between six weeks and five years of age. The multicultural centre reflects its community with many of the children of MƒÅori, Pacific or Indian descent. The integration of children‚Äôs home languages through the daily programme is a feature of the centre.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review the Ministry of Education has relicensed the previous two ABC Manurewa centres as one centre under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><p>The centre has also changed ownership and is now part of Kidicorp Ltd. Kidicorp policies, procedures and practices now underpin its operation. Business and professional support managers visit regularly to ensure that Kidicorp expectations are being met, and to promote ongoing centre development. A centre manager provides professional leadership to the centre‚Äôs teaching and leadership teams.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to the recommendations of the previous ERO report, as part of a programme of continuous improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs social and emotional well-being are well supported by caring, experienced teachers. Respectful relationships between adults and children contribute to a settled, harmonious atmosphere. Infants and toddlers receive good quality care. They benefit from teachers who know them and their families well. Children enjoy friendships and cooperate in play with each other. They enjoy well managed care routines.</p><p>Teachers are flexible and respond sensitively to children‚Äôs preferences and interests. Transitions into the centre and between rooms are carefully managed so that the change for children is gradual and responds to their growing confidence.</p><p>Teaching and learning promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to individuals and groups of children. They carefully support children to make choices from a wide range of learning activities. Teachers are positive and encouraging, building on what children can do. Children enjoy the opportunity to select play areas and engage in individual or group play for extended periods of time.</p><p>The centre celebrates the diversity of its community and programmes are inclusive of MƒÅori, Pacific and other cultures. Teachers‚Äô growing awareness of and appreciation for te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is evident throughout the programme and environment. WhƒÅnau are welcome in the centre and good relationships are evident between teachers and families. Centre leaders are exploring ways to enhance communications with parents, whƒÅnau and aiga to further promote parent partnerships in learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. The centre manager is focused on extending the knowledge and practice of the teaching team. She and her head teachers model good quality teaching practices and work effectively with Kidicorp personnel to promote ongoing teacher development. Self-review practices are embedded at all levels of operation and are clearly resulting in ongoing improvements for children. Centre leaders have a strong focus on continuing improvement through self review in order to guide significant development for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that the centre should use their well established self review processes to:</p><ul>
<li>explore ways in which all children‚Äôs learning can be extended through more specific programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>consider ways in which it could use care routines to better provide learning opportunities for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>continue to grow partnerships with parents and the local community to benefit children and their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Kidicorp should also consider refining its personnel policy and procedural documents to better reflect the company‚Äôs desire to exceed minimum requirements and achieve high quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Manurewa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Manurewa will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 September 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
