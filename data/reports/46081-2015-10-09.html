</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool’s first ERO report. The service operates in Mangere East under the Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool Trust and the Christian Congregation Church of Samoa. The centre became fully licensed in 2013 and operates as a bilingual Samoan preschool. It provides inclusive education and care for its culturally diverse community.</p><p>Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool is licensed for 50 children. It can have a maximum of 10 children under two years of age. The preschool provides separate spaces for the younger and older age groups.</p><p>The preschool’s philosophy aims to raise the participation and quality of education for Pacific children and to build on the local strengths of the community. It emphasises Christian values and Samoan language and culture. The preschool facilities were funded by the Ministry of Education’s Targeted Assistance for Participation initiative. The trust has plans underway to build another centre in the Mangere community.</p><p>The preschool maintains a high staff to child ratio and is committed to employing a high percentage of qualified staff. Of the six permanent teachers, one is fully registered. The centre manager is providing good support for the teaching team to develop shared understandings and practices, and to complete requirements for full registration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle well on arrival. They enjoy the activities that teachers have set up. Children are confident in their culture and language. They have lots of opportunities to develop their social competence with peers and adults. Children have access to a range of choices in their play and are encouraged to lead mat time and special events at the preschool.</p><p>The preschool’s philosophy is evident in the ways that teachers have created a bilingual and Christian-based environment. Teachers are caring and respectful of children. This is especially evident for the youngest children in the preschool.</p><p>Centre managers and staff have worked hard to develop and implement sound systems and processes to operate the preschool efficiently. This progress has been achieved with the assistance of external support and the collaborative and respectful relationships between the trust, staff and the community. As a result, the centre features shared leadership and collaborative approaches that support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The preschool has a commitment to valuing and including the diverse cultures of the community. Teachers are well supported by community members in the daily running of the centre. Teachers interact positively with children, and are welcoming and inclusive of children and their families.</p><p>Teachers provide programmes that link well to the early childhood curriculum and bible stories. They have established a balance between individual and group assessment practices, and plan and deliver a programme that is becoming more child responsive.</p><p>Self-review practices have been established. Trust members use self review to determine the centre direction and future plans. This happens through ongoing discussions between the trust and staff. Teachers use self review to gauge how well resources and routines are being used. They are developing ways to make indicators of good quality a part of their self-review practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The trust and teachers should continue to strengthen self-review processes so that they are better informed about how well they are achieving positive outcomes for children. Key next steps also include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to grow teachers’ professional capacity through professional development</li>
<li>sharing effective practice so that areas of play better extend and challenge children’s thinking</li>
<li>increasing teachers’ responsiveness to children’s interests and strengths to promote learning</li>
<li>strengthening early literacy and mathematics learning through the programme and environment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
