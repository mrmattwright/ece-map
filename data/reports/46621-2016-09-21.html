</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Chrysalis Early Learning Centre in Avondale is one of four centres operated by the Chrysalis Group. It opened in early 2015 and is licensed for up to 150 children, including up to 50 under the age of two. Children and staff come from diverse cultural backgrounds, including 15 percent MƒÅori, 15 percent Chinese, 13 percent Pacific, and 10 percent Indian. The majority of the remaining 47% of children identify as New Zealand European.</p><p>The property is an innovative design that emphasises the natural environments and sustainability, and celebrates local history and cultural diversity. Large protected trees are carefully incorporated in the outdoor design. These trees and the chrysalis concept are reflected in the Group's graphic illustration of its curriculum priorities and tools for assessment. They are also reflected in the unique indoor structural furnishings. The centre has received a variety of innovation, business and building design awards.</p><p>The directors' core philosophy focuses on children learning through imagination, inspiration and innovation. It recognises the importance of partnerships with families in children's learning and encourages guardianship of the environment. The directors promote respect for the bicultural heritage and multicultural society of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>The centre's four rooms are staffed by 16 qualified teachers. The four team leaders are fully registered teachers. Ten teachers are provisionally registered. A Chrysalis Group curriculum manager is also a fully registered teacher and supports teachers' ongoing professional development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have positive and respectful relationships with adults and each other. They are well supported to develop skills for social competence. Children and families experience a sense of inclusion and belonging in the centre.</p><p>Children have opportunities to make decisions and choices during the day. They approach adults confidently and initiate conversations. There are good levels of cooperative and imaginative interaction amongst children. Teachers work closely with children to support their play. They maintain a calm, unhurried tone, listen to children's ideas and support their developing conversational skills well.</p><p>Centre environments are carefully prepared to invite children's involvement in activities based on teachers' awareness of their developmental stages and interests. The rooms are light and spacious. Rooms open directly onto attractively landscaped, interesting and inviting outdoor play areas. Children make good use of these outdoor areas and have ready access to a variety of activities and resources.</p><p>Children in the infant and toddler rooms experience respectful, responsive and caring interactions and relationships. They have good space for exploration, both inside and out. Teachers in these areas have completed an in-depth review of research and developments relating to infant and toddler programmes. As a result, they have an increased understanding of high quality provision for children and are continuing to refine their practices.</p><p>The preschool room is particularly well resourced to support children's independent creativity and ongoing investigations. Children often initiate and lead programme developments here. There is also good provision for children's literacy, maths and science learning in this print-rich room.</p><p>Strong partnerships with families are a valued feature of the centre. The directors and teachers use a variety of strategies to communicate and exchange information with parents. A useful cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation has been established and is strongly focused on responding to individual children. Parent contributions to assessment and planning are an important part of the displays around the centre that are designed to make children's learning highly visible.</p><p>The directors are systematically building a strong sense of team and extending professional development and leadership capability across the centre and the Group. The curriculum manager provides guidance and critiques practice to promote professional discussion. Current work to strengthen the Group's processes for teacher appraisal will support this professional development focus.</p><p>The directors promote and lead a culture of reflection and ongoing improvement. They have established systems for centre operations and curriculum that reflect and support their vision, philosophical beliefs and Group priorities. Processes for spontaneous and in-depth self-review have been established. The directors continue to build on existing good practices to refine systems, increase effectiveness and ensure that quality assurance processes are robust.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The directors and curriculum manager have identified appropriate next steps for the centre that will support their strategic goals of building capability, curriculum development and continuous improvement. Key next steps to enhance current good practices include:</p><p>an in-depth evaluation of bicultural practice across the centre, with reference to the Ministry of Education's strategy <em>Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013 ‚Äì 2017</em>, and including the cultural competencies of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> in appraisal documents</p><ul>
<li>
<p>examining practices across the centre, to ensure that teaching strategies that promote complex play and extended learning are consistent, purposefully planned and evaluated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that systematic, in-depth internal evaluation at all levels of centre operations contributes to the directors' knowledge of the extent to which the service is meeting all its obligations and progressing towards strategic goals, and helps in identifying next steps for development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Chrysalis Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Chrysalis Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
