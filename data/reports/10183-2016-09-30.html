</table><p>The owners have made some changes since ERO's 2013 review but not all of the recommendations made in that report have been addressed. It is now becoming urgent for the owners to access support to improve many aspects of their provision for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ol-wens Little School is a privately owned centre which runs in tandem with a centre for infants and toddlers. The owners and share-holders intend to merge these two centres before 2017. The centre caters for up to 30 children over the age of two years. The roll at present includes a significant number of children with MƒÅori heritage.</p><p>The centre owners report that employing qualified teachers has been difficult. At present, the service has three untrained teachers and three who hold qualifications. Not all of the teachers work every day and many of the children only attend for the free hours offered by the Ministry of Education.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review identified the need to improve self review, bicultural practices, and strategic and annual planning. The owners have begun to make some progress.</p><p>The centre owners have made a commitment to increase the focus on bicultural heritage and practice. This commitment is visible in the centre, and in children's obvious familiarity with waiata, te reo MƒÅori and karakia.</p><p>A start has been made to develop an annual plan that includes goals for the centre for the coming year. The strategic plan has yet to be developed. Appraisal is annual but needs to be more rigorous to challenge teachers to make continuous improvements to their practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are welcomed at the start of the day, and most settle quickly to the activities provided for them. Children know the routines well and are compliant with expectations.</p><p>The vision and philosophy statements for the two centres have recently been reviewed. Self-review processes have been a focus, and some good documentation about several reviews has been collected.</p><p>The centre owners are committed to increasing the focus on bicultural heritage and practice. This commitment is visible in the centre and children are familiar with waiata and words in te reo MƒÅori. A recent celebration of Matariki was enjoyed by children and their parents.</p><p>There is a sense of space and cleanliness in the playroom. Teachers have started to provide interesting and attractive environments. This is good starting point for promoting respect for people places and things.</p><p>With parent support the owners and teachers upgraded the outdoor area to make it a more practical and attractive place for children's play. The programme has included opportunities for children to eat some of the produce out of the centre gardens. They do this with considerable enthusiasm.</p><p>There is a need for the owners and teachers to continue to become better informed about current good quality practice in early childhood education. Assessment processes indicate teachers' growing ability to write about children's learning experiences.</p><p>The owners should now seek external support, including mentoring and appraisals for themselves, to develop their understanding of effective leadership, management and personnel practices. This could help them to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish more robust appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update policies, procedures and personnel information in line with new legal requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a strategic plan that links to the annual plan, appraisals and evaluative self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that teachers have clear information about their various roles and responsibilities in the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified and management agreed that the key next steps were to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that all children have a sense of belonging and wellbeing, and are encouraged to be independent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more deliberately extend children's individual strengths and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek external support in order to inform and upskill teachers in their practice, including developing bicultural practice and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen self review across all aspects of the service, in order to comply with legal and accountability requirements and to enable teachers to make judgements about the effectiveness of programmes in supporting children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write more individualised learning stories in children's portfolios and include a more evaluative focus on teaching and learning to better inform both teachers and parents of children's progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek parent contributions to portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the range and quantity of resources provided for children's play.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ol-wens Little School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas in order to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plan, implement and evaluate a curriculum that effectively demonstrates and responds to children's learning, their interests, whƒÅnau and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that the service is effectively governed and managed to meet good management practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 43, 47 (1a).</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ol-wens Little School will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
