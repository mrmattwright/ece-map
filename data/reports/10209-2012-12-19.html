<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Jemma&rsquo;s Family Day Care Ltd 3 is one of seven home-based child care networks owned and operated by Jemma&rsquo;s. The network is in West Auckland and has educarers overseen by two coordinators who are qualified early childhood teachers. The service has a positive ERO reporting history and continues with its commitment to high quality care.</p><p>Children are comfortable and settled and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in educarers homes. Warm, responsive relationships are evident and children play confidently in the home environments. There is good provision for the variety of ages in care. Children are well supported to develop social competence and good relationships with each other.</p><p>Educarers provide inclusive, good quality care in their own homes. They have access to a good range of on-going professional development and training. The home environments are well resourced and are child friendly. Programmes are related to children&rsquo;s play interests and are supplemented by Jemma&rsquo;s toy library equipment. Children experience a variety of experiences in the local communities and most attend regular playgroup meetings with other educarers and children.</p><p>Network coordinators work in supportive ways with each other and with educarers. They frequently visit the educarers and provide suggestions for programme development. They monitor health and safety requirements and Jemma&rsquo;s expectations for quality care.</p><p>Jemma&rsquo;s governance and management processes are well established. Managers are aware of the benefit of developing robust self review to guide continuing improvement to the organisation.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>This review of Jemma&rsquo;s Family Day Care Ltd 3 has been informed by service documentation, meetings with service personnel, written feedback from parents and educarers, observations of a sample group of educarers programmes and a playgroup session.</p><p>Educarers are supported to provide education and care programmes for children by network coordinators. These are qualified, registered early childhood teachers who provide assistance and guidance to all educarers.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO report the organisation has been restructured. Managers have appointed a new senior coordinator and organisation administrator. Two new coordinators have been appointed to the West Auckland area.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Children participate in a wide variety of age appropriate experiences. Educarers provide a good variety of curriculum areas. Jemma&rsquo;s supplement the educarers&rsquo; curriculum resources through a toy library. There is a focus by educarers on increasing children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy knowledge and skill. A new home book library has been introduced where children are able to take books to their own home to support literacy acquisition.</p><p>Children initiate their own play and access their own resources. They are encouraged to be creative and try things out. Resources and activities are age appropriate. Regular daily outings and attendance at a Jemma&rsquo;s playgroup, as well as an adventure playgroup and a programme for four year olds are positive features of the organisation. Coordinators and educarers use of te reo M&#257;ori is becoming more evident.</p><p>Relationships are a strength of the service. Coordinators are developing a team approach to supporting educarers in providing good quality programmes. They develop close relationships with families and work together to identify children&rsquo;s next learning and development steps. Managers are approachable and have good working relationships with coordinators and families.</p><p>Jemma&rsquo;s curriculum is influenced by Christian values and guided by the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum framework and children&rsquo;s play interests. Educarers are developing an understanding of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> and with making curriculum links to children&rsquo;s progress and learning. Educarers take care with presentation of children&rsquo;s portfolios. Coordinators should continue to support educarers to develop their assessment, planning and evaluation skills.</p><p>Coordinators know the families well. Educarers affirm the accessibility of coordinators and the help they receive from them. They have access to good opportunities for professional learning and network with each other. Clear management expectations are documented in a comprehensive operations manual.</p><p>Quality assurance is a strength of the service. Processes are in place to ensure that all areas of operation are delivering a responsive service. The senior coordinator has overall responsibility for supporting all coordinators and works closely with new coordinators. Managers visit all of the educarers each year.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>In order to improve the good quality of programmes provided for children, management and coordinators agree they could:</p><ul>
<li>review the service philosophy and develop indicators of good practice and use these as an ongoing self-review tool</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes that focus on improving learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>continue to model good practice and support educarers to raise the quality of education thy provide</li>
<li>further develop a shared understanding about, and commitment to, implementing bicultural practices and promoting success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Jemma's Family Day Care Ltd 3 completed an ERO Home-Based Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
