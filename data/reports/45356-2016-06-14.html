</table><p>A supplementary ERO review in 2013, stated it was critical the improvements identified be developed further. This review has found that while self-review practices are stronger, most areas identified in two earlier ERO reports still require significant levels of improvement.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The centre is a privately owned, Christian-based service. The owners are currently managing the centre after several changes in management. The majority of staff are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers. Several have recently upgraded their qualifications.</p><p>The centre operates from two purpose-built facilities. The newest opened in November 2015 for children under three years of age. Each area has its own outdoor play space. There is a head teacher in each area. Most children attend part time and live in the local rural community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There are positive relationships between children and teachers. They have respectful interactions with each other. Children play well together. They benefit from periods of uninterrupted time to build friendships and learn together.</p><p>Teachers listen carefully to infants, toddlers and young children's ideas and cues. They respond by:</p><ul>
<li>providing opportunities for children to make choices and be leaders</li>
<li>supporting children's interests through suitable resourcing</li>
<li>promoting oral language development in the nursery.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers welcome children and their families. There is an increased level of involvement by parents and families in the centre and programme. Online communication is supporting information sharing between teachers and parents. Teachers take notice of parents' aspirations for their children.</p><p>Children are provided with a good range of learning experiences. The spacious outdoor area for older children enables them to run, explore and challenge themselves.</p><p>Teachers are supporting transition to school through weekly visits to the local school. Children make use of the school's library and physical education opportunities.</p><p>Professional development has supported the centre to adopt a useful framework for self review. A recent review has led to increased use of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme and environment. Teachers are using spontaneous self reviews to highlight areas for investigation and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO is not confident that suitable systems are in place to support improvements in the performance of the service. There is a lack of coherence across key aspects of the centre. Significant areas of governance and management need to be urgently addressed. These include the need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategic and annual planning showing the goals and direction of the centre</li>
<li>ensure there are strong links between the centre philosophy, strategic plans and other key documents and practices through to what is happening in the programme for children</li>
<li>develop and implement a high quality appraisal system linked to centre goals</li>
<li>ensure that all staff are regularly appraised and have clear job descriptions that show roles and responsibilities for different roles</li>
<li>develop a professional development plan that prioritises ongoing external professional development and focuses on areas of key importance for promoting positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>establish a planned approach to growing staff leadership</li>
<li>refine aspects of self review so that it is more evaluative</li>
<li>review the policy and procedures framework to ensure best practice.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there is a need to establish consistent assessment and planning guidelines and practices for teaching and learning. This would assist teachers to better meet needs of individuals and further promote child-led learning.</p><p>Toddlers in the nursery have inadequate opportunities within the outdoor area to extend their learning and development through building, climbing, exploring. This area opened in November 2015 and needs to be appropriately resourced.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Ones Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop effective governance and management practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure a robust performance management process is in place and that all staff are regularly appraised.</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulations 47, 1a and GMA7</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Ones Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>14 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
