</table><p>Sandringham Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sandringham Kindergarten is licensed for up to 30 children over two years of age. It offers six-hour sessions and has three qualified teachers who are supported by an administrator and a teaching assistant. The kindergarten serves an increasingly multicultural community.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships with children and their families. Children are respected and viewed as confident and independent learners. Teachers are inspired by a Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and learning. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is acknowledged as a guiding document for teacher practice.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified that the manager should strengthen the evaluative aspects of self review, extend teacher knowledge of te ao MƒÅori and develop partnerships and cultural connections with the kindergarten community. There has been significant progress made in these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides leadership, a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel and programmes of professional learning and development for staff. A new AKA structure and new leadership roles have been established, and new personnel appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families experience a warm, welcoming and caring environment that is respectful of their culture, language and identity. Children are quick to settle into the programme and engage in positive relationships and interactions with both adults and other children. There are opportunities for children to lead aspects of the programme with confidence. Children are viewed as capable and competent learners. They are encouraged to be independent.</p><p>Teachers have thoughtfully developed the learning environment to promote different ways for children to be creative and active problem solvers. The environment is richly resourced and children engage in a wide variety of experiences that promote their curiosity. Children experience a calm and unhurried programme that recognises the individual pace of learning.</p><p>Teachers work as a collaborative team. They have a strong understanding of and a shared commitment to their revised philosophy, which has enhanced opportunities for children to learn. Teachers are supportive and respectful of their individual strengths and open to sharing ideas about practice.</p><p>Teachers' professional focus is aligned with the kindergarten's strategic priorities. Their Whakamanawa professional learning has made a significant impact on teachers' ability to use te reo MƒÅori confidently and to implement bicultural practices throughout the programme. Children have good opportunities to learn about the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and showcase what they have learned. Ongoing, robust, professional dialogue about the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi supports teaching practices.</p><p>There is a strong focus on science, mathematics, literacy and social sciences throughout the programme. Teachers are building a local curriculum that is meaningful for children. A strong sense of history and community is being established and well documented.</p><p>Planning and assessment processes are clear, with a focus on the children's individuality and their learning dispositions. Children's records of learning show how they have the freedom to explore their environment. The learning that teachers value, respect and foster is aligned with whƒÅnau aspirations for their children.</p><p>The head teacher has built a responsive team. Individual strengths are identified through an appraisal process and opportunities for leadership are encouraged. The AKA systems, policies and procedures are used efficiently. A shared understanding of internal evaluation has resulted in ongoing improvements.</p><p>The AKA continues to provide support for kindergartens to strengthen bicultural practices. In many instances this has made a significant difference to teachers' confidence and capability. Specialist support impacts positively on teachers‚Äô inclusion of children with additional learning needs. Priority is being given to re-establishing and supporting Parent WhƒÅnau Groups in all kindergartens. The strategic direction being established by new AKA leaders is providing a positive framework for kindergartens‚Äô annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team has identified appropriate key next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen the extent to which children's learning progress is explicit in their assessment records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>linking teachers' appraisal goals more clearly to learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would be useful for AKA managers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify new roles and engage teaching teams in the implementation of the new structure across the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen internal evaluation at all levels of the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some kindergartens, across the AKA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sandringham Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
