</table><p>Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre is a parent cooperative that operates under the umbrella of the Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional Hub (ARH). It operates in a well-resourced building with an aesthetically designed natural playground. It is licensed for 25 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. It operates for three sessions per week. Children are from a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy of <span lang="mi">'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi',</span> adults and children learning together, guides centre practices. Sessions are guided by <span lang="mi"><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>,</span> the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></p><p>ERO's 2016 report identified positive aspects of the programme such as rich learning experiences, and an environment that supported children's learning about the natural world. Areas for improvement included planning, assessment and evaluation, strategic planning, and bicultural practice. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The new structure of Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> is now fully operational and a review of this new structure is currently underway. The organisation provides a sound management framework as well as support personnel to assist centre members in managing their centres. Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> administers centres‚Äô funding and provides an adult education programme for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve Playcentre qualifications. Centre members have adopted planned approaches to embracing and implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. A new licensee/contact person is in the process of being appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional hub.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and articulate, and initiate conversations with adults and other children. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and ownership in the centre. Children settle quickly, have fun, and are engaged and eager to learn. They participate in the programme enthusiastically and are able to sustain their play activities and interests.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau interact in warm, responsive and positive ways, building strong relationships with all children. Older children have formed friendships and play cooperatively. Adults provide a variety of good quality resources that encourage children to be creative and imaginative. They foster children's growing independence, and value their discoveries. Parents/whƒÅnau could consider ways to involve children in planning the daily programme with them.</p><p>Centre members are committed to growing their knowledge of <span lang="mi">te reo and te ao MƒÅori</span> and promoting bicultural practices. Children's cultures, strengths and abilities are reflected in the curriculum. Centre members have experimented with having Mandarin immersion sessions and are exploring other ways to be responsive to their community.</p><p>Children of all ages have access to a wide range of activities. The learning environment reflects children's interests, and adults encourage children to think and problem solve. Parents/whƒÅnau provide a play-based programme and integrate literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful ways. Infants and toddlers have an area designated for uninterrupted play. Centre members could consider ways to differentiate the programme so that it supports younger children's learning more effectively.</p><p>A strong sense of community and shared purpose is evident. Centre members play an active role in supporting their children‚Äôs education and centre operations. They record their children's participation in the programme and children's interests inform the curriculum. There are some good records of children's learning and progress over time.</p><p>Internal evaluation is collaborative and results in improvements. The strategic plan guides the future direction of the centre. Adults are developing a shared understanding of implementing the new Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> systems and policy framework.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau have access to relevant learning and development, and incentives are provided for members who complete Playcentre courses. There is good support for them to develop shared understandings about quality teaching and learning.</p><p>The regional management team takes responsibility for supporting effective centre operations. They are aware of the strengths and needs of the centre and provide professional leadership to promote improvement and growth. The centre support worker is guided by the regional centre support coordinator. This support helps the centre to continue to develop quality programmes for children, and sound health and safety monitoring practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to continue to develop shared understandings about:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em> to recognise, respond to and evaluate children's learning and progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening their daily evaluation by identifying intended learning outcomes and adults' effectiveness in promoting these outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning the strategic and annual plan and evaluating the impact of its progress on children's learning outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional Hub, are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify new roles and engage service leaders in the implementation of the new structure across Auckland Playcentres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen internal evaluation at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some centres.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 June 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
