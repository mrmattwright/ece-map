</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Magnolia Tree Raglan, formerly known as Raglan Early Childcare and Education Centre, is located in the seaside township of Raglan. The centre has recently been purchased by an owner who is an experienced manager in early childhood education. The roll of 52 children, including 11 who are Māori, has remained stable. The centre is licensed for 40 children including 12 up to the age of two years. Children learn and play in two age-related rooms. They frequently interact as a whole group and share the outdoor play area. The centre hours have been extended and are now until six o'clock in the evening each day.</p><p>The 2015 ERO review identified the following areas for review and development:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extending the understanding and use of self review for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing strategic and annual goals to guide centre direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a robust appraisal process aligned to Education Council requirements and centre strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This 2016 ERO review identifies the progress made following a two year period during which the centre was supported by Ministry of Education (MoE) funded external advice and guidance. This has included staff professional development in strategic and annual planning, and self review.</p><p>Two experienced senior leaders, with the support of management and external expertise, have improved the quality of self review, appraisal, and professional development to build teacher capability and enhance outcomes for children. The new centre owner recognises that a planned programme of self review will be required to review these and other aspects of centre practice.</p><p>The centre is well established in the local Raglan community. Since the previous ERO review, there have been some changes to the teaching staff, including the recent appointment of a new teacher in the over-two area. The new centre owner has appointed a senior teacher to act in the role of centre manager until a permanent appointment can be been made. Centre staff continue to maintain positive and warm relationships with children and their whānau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre staff have made good progress in relation to the areas for review and development in the 2015 ERO report. Through a collaborative process, the centre staff and manager have been supported by external expertise, to develop strategic and annual plans and a draft philosophy statement. They have begun to implement an appropriate appraisal process aligned to Education Council requirements. A robust self-review process has been introduced and is now being used to bring about improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre staff continue to acknowledge and embed te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme. They use Māori concepts, values, stories and places of local significance to enrich the learning for all children. Māori values of aroha, mana and whanaungatanga have been included in strategic planning and the centre philosophy.</p><p>Head teachers and staff continue to strengthen key teaching practices for babies and toddlers. They provide rich learning experiences both indoors and outdoors. Babies and toddlers benefit from close trusting relationships with teachers. They are encouraged to explore and experiment in a well- planned and presented environment that engages their interest and develops their physical skills and co-ordination.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed and extended learning by introducing weekly excursions for older children to enjoy challenging experiences in the natural bush environment. Children's creative abilities are supported by opportunities to engage in imaginative play, music, art and drama. Literacy and numeracy are naturally embedded in the curriculum. Children engage in extended conversations with their teachers and one another. They develop and grow as confident and competent learners and communicators with a strong sense of belonging in their local environment.</p><p>Learning stories capture children's learning and development and provide parents with a valuable record of their child's involvement in the centre programme. Parents' contributions, including their aspirations for their children, are invited and acknowledged. Children's learning is recognised by teachers and appropriate links are made to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> (the early childhood curriculum).</p><p>Teachers could now increase the inclusion of children's voices in learning stories to increase their involvement in and recognition of their own learning. They could also make links between learning stories more visible so that progress over time is acknowledged. Greater acknowledgement of the child's language, culture and identity in the learning portfolios is also necessary to strengthen links with whānau and increase teacher awareness of children's prior learning. Centre leaders are beginning to make children's learning stories available to parents and whānau through an on-line programme.</p><p>Through a clear and collaborative self-review process, teachers have extended their knowledge and professional capability, and taken on leadership roles and responsibilities. Teachers use meeting times to reflect on their practice and evaluate their communication with parents/whānau and the quality of outcomes for children. The centre's professional learning culture has been extended and deepened through the teachers' positive response to externally provided support and assistance.</p><p>The new centre owner/service provider has taken a deliberate and proactive approach to building positive relationships with children, parents/whānau and staff. She has completed the necessary steps for the change of ownership and has begun to review systems and processes for centre organisation and management. As the service provider she is reviewing roles and responsibilities of staff, strategic goals, and priorities for development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre owner and head teachers agree that the priority areas for further development are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisiting the centre philosophy in order to develop shared understandings of teaching and learning aligned to current research and good practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening transitions into, within and beyond the centre, taking account of key teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refurbishing the outdoor area to provide greater variety of learning experiences for babies, toddlers and young children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the appraisal process to further improve the quality of teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Magnolia Tree Raglan completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Magnolia Tree Raglan will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>20 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><ul>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
