</table><p>Fundamentals Preschool Marshland is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fundamentals Preschool Marshland is a small, privately-owned centre. It provides full-day care and education for up to 32 children over 2 years to school age. The centre opened in 2014. At the time of this review there were 16 children enrolled. Concepts of physical development and challenge underpin the centre's programme to support children to think, act and succeed in mind, body and spirit, and to be confident learners.</p><p>The leadership team is made up of the supervisor and assistant supervisor. Other teachers have leadership roles in the daily running of the centre.</p><p>This review was part of the review of the two centres in the Fundamentals Preschool organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging in their centre. They learn and play in a calm, settled environment.</p><p>Children play an integral part in the learning process. They are often aware of the learning purpose of activities, for example their current gym focus. Their interests are the basis for planned and child-led activities. They have opportunities to be the teacher and share new learning with other children.</p><p>Teachers' planning clearly outlines the learning intended and how the children will be supported. There is deliberate inclusion of activities into the daily programme to support identified learning needs of individual children.</p><p>Children benefit from meaningful interactions with their teachers that extend and challenge their thinking, knowledge and imaginations.</p><p>Children learn from a wide range of opportunities that include:</p><ul>
<li>regular physical activity and challenge</li>
<li>naturally integrated early literacy and mathematics activities</li>
<li>relevant excursions into the community and to city facilities to extend on centre-based learning</li>
<li>child-led play that encourages creativity and imagination.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers show a genuine commitment to providing an environment for children to learn about New Zealand's bicultural heritage. This learning is effectively integrated through the programme.</p><p>The assistant supervisor provides knowledgeable leadership for the teaching team and models effective teaching practice.</p><p>The Fundamentals Preschool owners and leaders have provided appropriate resources and equipment to support the philosophy of children's physical development being key to being a successful learner.</p><p>As a result of research and professional learning and development (PLD):</p><ul>
<li>teaching teams are working more collaboratively</li>
<li>the appraisal process has been improved to meet the Teachers Council requirements and be more effective in improving teaching practices. It now needs to be further strengthened by including more critical and formal feedback to individual teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have identified priorities for improvement through evaluation practices, including gathering parents' ideas and opinions. Relevant PLD and appraisal goals have been aligned to the areas for improvement for all teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build on teachers awareness of and confidence in providing a bicultural learning environment for all children</li>
<li>more deliberately reflect on the effectiveness of teaching to meet intended learning</li>
<li>develop a strategic plan that shows clear priorities for improvement over a two to three year period</li>
<li>develop evaluation practices to show how operations, programmes and interactions, effectively reflect the centre's philosophy and policies</li>
<li>develop a procedural manual.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fundamentals Preschool Marshland will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
