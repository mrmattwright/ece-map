</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Sia-ae-toutaiola, is a privately owned total immersion Tongan centre that offers full-day education and care for children from three months to school age. The centre opened in 2015 in a purpose built facility in Papatoetoe. It is licensed for 40 children including 12 children under two years of age. This is the centre's first ERO report.</p><p>Most of the children are of Tongan heritage. The centre promotes a strong philosophy of Tongan values and Christian beliefs within a culturally appropriate learning environment. Tongan language, culture and identity are valued and promoted. Importance is placed on supporting children to thrive as competent, confident learners and communicators.</p><p>The owners/directors are actively involved in centre governance and leadership. They work closely with the centre manager and administrator to progress the centre's strategic plan. The manager is responsible for overall daily centre operations and works closely with the five teachers and the administrator.</p><p>Together with parents, families and the wider Tongan community, the centre directors and leaders have developed strong networks with their community and surrounding schools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is well enacted and aligns with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. There is a strong commitment to the shared vision. Tongan beliefs and Christian values underpin the centre's culture. Parents promote the centre's philosophy in the wider Tongan community.</p><p>The welcoming and well managed environment offers indoor and outdoor areas that invite children to create, be curious and engage in learning. There are well considered spaces that reflect curriculum areas such as science, mathematics, art, literacy and computer technology. Culturally rich learning environments invite children and their families to learn and play together. Infants and toddlers enjoy their own spacious indoor and outdoor spaces to play at their own pace.</p><p>Children at the centre are becoming confident in their identity as Tongan in Aotearoa New Zealand. Children from other ethnic backgrounds also enjoy a sense of belonging and are happy in the environment. They are encouraged to be independent, and socially and culturally competent. Most children take responsibility and are actively involved in centre routines.  </p><p>Respect is integral to the culture of the centre. Most teachers are fluent Tongan speakers and use the language to build positive and respectful relationships with children and their families. Teachers model trusting and positive interactions for children.</p><p>Skilful, intentional teaching supports children to engage in positive responses with each other and with teachers. The teaching team has developed useful planning and assessment systems. Teachers regularly meet to discuss programme plans.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to children's interests and strengths and promotes culturally rich activities and experiences. Developing a bicultural partnership is a focus for teachers and this aligns well with the Tongan programme.</p><p>Good relationships have been established with local schools. Children are well supported as they transition into and out of the centre, and on to school.</p><p>The manager provides high quality leadership and models high expectations for staff. Positive relationships underpin successful team building and a harmonious working environment for adults. Staff are encouraged to lead in many areas and roles and responsibilities are understood within a cultural context and family values.</p><p>Professional learning opportunities are prioritised from staff development goals and centre strategic goals. A personalised appraisal process encourages teacher growth and reflection. Strategic planning supports the centre to achieve its vision. Internal evaluation is well understood by leaders and used to make ongoing sustainable improvements.</p><p>There is a shared recognition that parents' involvement is important and partnerships with parents and families are developing well. Teachers use deliberate strategies to consider and respond to parents’ aspirations and perspectives. Parents' expectations that their children will be successful growing up in Aotearoa drive the centre's focus on continued positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that they should continue to use robust internal evaluation to make ongoing improvements. Key focus areas for evaluation include:</p><ul>
<li>the extent to which the environment and programmes provide physical challenges for children</li>
<li>how effectively teaching practices promote positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>monitoring progress towards strategic goals. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Sia-ae-toutaiola completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Sia-ae-toutaiola will be in three years. </p><p>Steffan Brough<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>22 May 2017<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
