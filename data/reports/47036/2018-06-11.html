</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Richmond is situated in the Taup≈ç suburb of Richmond Heights and is owned by BestStart, a not-for-profit organisation. It provides full-day and sessional education and care for children aged from two years to school age in a mixed-age setting. It is licensed for 50 children. The current roll of 52 includes nine children of MƒÅori descent and nine from a range of other backgrounds.</p><p>The centre opened in 2016 and gained its full licence in 2017. An area manager provides professional leadership and business management support to the centre. The centre manager is currently supported by two qualified and registered teachers and a caregiver is also employed. Since the opening there has been significant changes to the teaching team.</p><p>The centre's vision is to inspire a love of learning for all in their learning community. The recently documented philosophy is based on three key areas: family, community and quality. The service is an active member of the Taup≈ç Community of Learning|KƒÅhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is inclusive and provides a wide range of learning experiences. It supports children‚Äôs health and wellbeing, physical and cognitive development. Planned learning experiences within the local community enrich children's engagement. Leaders and teachers acknowledge the diverse cultures of children and their families in the centre and provide meaningful learning opportunities to support them. They work with parents, families and the wider community to enable positive relationships with a focus on multi-cultural awareness. Children, parents and whƒÅnau have developed a strong sense belonging.</p><p>The assessment, planning and evaluation practice for children's learning has recently been reviewed and now needs time to embed. There is a strong focus on an individual planning system for each child. Children with additional learning needs are responsively planned for in collaboration with parents and external agencies where appropriate. Leaders agree that there is a need to strengthen the consistency of assessment practices for all children within the new system.</p><p>Teachers use a range of useful teaching strategies to support children's learning. They are responding well to professional learning about oral language development, and reflecting on their own practice to support children's communication skills. Intentional teaching and planning utilises a quality range of resources to enhance learning. Learning experiences support literacy, mathematics and science concepts in the indoor environment. Further development is needed in making these opportunities more readily available and visible in the outdoor area. Some elements of Te ao MƒÅori are visible in wall displays and there is a need to further develop the bicultural curriculum and teaching practices. Transitions into and out of the centre are well managed based on individual needs. Children benefit from responsive, caring and respectful relationships with teachers.</p><p>Leaders have high expectations for teaching and centre-wide practices. They are implementing the shared philosophy and vision for the centre. Effective communication supports collaboration and high levels of relational trust between the centre manager, area manager and the new teaching team. Emergent leadership is encouraged and regular meetings with teachers support professional practice. Leaders have liaised with the local iwi, T≈´wharetoa, to strengthen culturally responsive practice. They are focussed on improving quality and outcomes for children.</p><p>The governing organisation has strong systems and processes to guide all centre operations. Centre priorities are well aligned to the overarching strategic plan, vision and goals. Consultation with parents and staff is responsive and ongoing. The organisation has a commitment to children and staff wellbeing through targeted programmes. Extensive opportunities for professional learning and development are provided and there is a strategic approach to growing leaders within the BestStart organisation. Effective internal evaluation focuses on improved practice and outcomes for children. Children benefit from high-quality education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree the next steps for this centre are to continue strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the consistency of assessment and planning with a focus on showing progression of learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the integration of MƒÅori culture, values and language in the curriculum, teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the availability of literacy and mathematics experiences in the outdoor environment and adding complexity to learning for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Richmond completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Richmond will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>11 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
