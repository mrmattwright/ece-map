<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging. The kindergarten is building its capacity in aspects of assessment, planning, and self review with the continuing support of the Kidsfirst Kindergartens association.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and West Coast. An education services manager (ESM) works with each kindergarten giving feedback and professional support. All teachers are registered and fully qualified. A diverse community uses the kindergarten. This includes children from a range of cultures and learning needs.</p>
<p>Since the April 2009 ERO review this kindergarten has had some changes in teaching and support staff. Improvements have been made to some bicultural aspects of the programme such as greater use of te reo M&#257;ori. Teachers have recently changed the programme so that it has more opportunities for children to make choices, develop independence, and lead their play.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine early childhood education services within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Teachers have effective relationships with children and their families. They are welcoming, sensitive and caring towards children. Teachers promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Teachers support children&rsquo;s families. They regularly share information with parents and provide additional support when needed. Teachers are increasing the ways parents can contribute information to inform decisions about the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers have positive and supportive interactions with children. They:</p>
<ul><li>make good use of their regular conversations with children to learn more about their lives</li>
<li>support children who need extra support to settle into the programme</li>
<li>recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths</li>
<li>help children learn about their emotions and how to play successfully with others.</li>
</ul><p>The association Education Services Manager (ESM) is a good role model in the kindergarten for supporting and extending children&rsquo;s learning. She is providing specific and useful feedback to the teaching team about their practices.</p>
<p>The interesting and attractive outdoor environment is a feature of this kindergarten. Play areas encourage children to explore and learn about the natural world and New Zealand plants. There is a good range of equipment to support children&rsquo;s physical play. Aspects of the cultures of children who attend, such as M&#257;ori culture, are prominent in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>The kindergarten has strong links with the local school. Teachers make good use of their location on school grounds to take part in the school programmes and events. The kindergarten shares useful information with the school. This information is helping children to experience a smooth transition to school.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s involvement in a wide range of activities and experiences is visible through informative displays and books about children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>The teachers have developed the way they make changes to the programme and their practices. They are beginning to look more deeply at the quality of what they are doing and how they can provide more opportunities for parents and children to contribute to self review.</p>
<p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association has a well developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work of the kindergarten by the ESM and head teacher. Kidsfirst managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Ongoing professional development from the ESM should help teachers better support children's learning. The Kidsfirst Kindergarten managers and the teaching team have reliably identified the next steps for improvement.</p>
<h4><em>Assessment</em></h4>
<p>Teachers are at the early stages of improving aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment identified in the last ERO review. Priority should be given to:</p>
<ul><li>helping children become more involved in planning the direction of their learning</li>
<li>including and responding to parent aspirations for children&rsquo;s learning within the planning for individual children</li>
<li>strengthening ways of writing about children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds in learning stories</li>
<li>showing how the next steps for children&rsquo;s learning will add value and progress.</li>
</ul><p><em>Planning</em></p>
<p>Teachers have been working on developing programme planning. The next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>make better use of children&rsquo;s individual assessment information to inform programme planning</li>
<li>clearly identify teaching strategies to extend on the learning</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of teaching strategies on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><h4><em>Self Review</em></h4>
<p>Teachers are yet to complete a full cycle of the new in-depth self-review processes. The next steps are to evaluate the impact of changes made over time.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p>

<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>Review focus</h4>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
