The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">The Westport Early Learning Centre is a not-for-profit organisation which is governed by a board of elected parents and community members. The centre provides good quality education and care for children from infancy to five years of age. Since the June 2008 ERO review, the centre has moved to its new purpose-built premises and has been relicensed under the 2008 regulations for early childhood services.</p><p align="left">The managers and staff told ERO they have spent a considerable amount of time adapting programmes and routines to better suit the new learning spaces, the learning needs of the children and the professional needs of staff. The effective use of external support has contributed greatly to the centre&rsquo;s successful establishment and staff training.</p><p align="left">Children experience warm and nurturing relationships with each other and adults. These positive relationships include the interactions staff have with each other and with parents. Other features of the centre programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the positive ways staff respond to children&rsquo;s cues to build communication skills in the nursery</li>
<li>the range of opportunities children have to work independently in small groups for sustained periods of time</li>
<li>the confidence of staff and children in using te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori during the day</li>
<li>the opportunities for staff to take leadership roles within the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The managers acknowledge the need to further develop leadership and management skills to support the positive future of the centre. They agree that this development is required to improve outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the ownership of children&rsquo;s learning between parents and teachers</li>
<li>better identifying learning that is occurring</li>
<li>improving strategic planning.</li>
<li>making links between strategic planning, self review and professional development.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The board, managers and staff have good processes in place to provide children with a safe, secure and healthy learning environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Westport Early Learning Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWestport Early Learning Centre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The service philosophy is focused on the provision of high-quality care and education in a welcoming, safe and nurturing environment for children and their families. Staff aim to provide a curriculum which is based on routines, spontaneous happenings and children&rsquo;s interests. They allow time for children to engage in activities alongside their peers and build on each other&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Children experience warm and nurturing relationships. Infants and toddlers benefit from individualised and personalised care from their primary caregiver or key teacher. ERO observed children who were happy, settled and confident in the infant and toddler, and preschool areas. Staff successfully involve parents in the programme and encourage them to share home events and information about their child. Managers and teachers effectively involve the wider community in the life of the centre. This builds on children&rsquo;s interests and extends their knowledge of their community.</p><p align="left">Managers and staff are making good progress in using and understanding te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. They are making strong connections to the wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children and the wider M&#257;ori community. Staff plan and regularly undertake further training to improve their cultural knowledge and confidence. Routines include the successful integration of tikanga and reo M&#257;ori. Children confidently use te reo and take a leadership role during karakia with support of staff and other children.</p><p align="left">Staff listen to and respond promptly to children. In the infant and toddler area, staff explain to children what they are doing and what could happen next to build on children&rsquo;s oral language. In the preschool area, staff actively involve children in conversation and help them to find additional resources to extend their play.</p><p align="left">Staff have reviewed daily routines and improved the opportunities for sustained play and learning. They provide a good range of resources and activities in the indoor and outdoor areas. ERO observed children in the preschool area making good use of the resources to develop and build upon their ideas over time.</p><p align="left">External support and guidance has resulted in significant improvements in the quality of learning and teaching. This has included board members, centre managers and staff:</p><ul>
<li>developing a better understanding of learning and teaching through self review, professional development and leadership opportunities</li>
<li>clarifying governance, leadership and management roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>developing a more supportive and collaborative culture and teamwork</li>
<li>improving health and safety policies, procedures and practices.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Managers and ERO agree the next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing shared ownership of children&rsquo;s learning between parents and teachers</li>
<li>identifying the learning that is occurring for children and the teacher&rsquo;s role in supporting and extending the learning</li>
<li>strengthening the strategic plan to focus more on learning and teaching to improve outcomes for all children</li>
<li>making links between the strategic goals, self review, appraisal and professional development.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Westport Early Learning Centre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The centre provides good quality education and care for children from infancy to five years of age. Since the June 2008 ERO review, the centre has moved to its new purpose-built premises and has been relicensed under the 2008 regulations for early childhood services.</p><p align="left">The managers and staff told ERO they have spent a considerable amount of time adapting programmes and routines to better suit the new learning spaces, the learning needs of the children and the professional needs of staff. The effective use of external support has contributed greatly to the centre&rsquo;s successful establishment and staff training.</p><p align="left">Children experience warm and nurturing relationships with each other and adults. These positive relationships include the interactions staff have with each other and with parents. Other features of the centre programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the positive ways staff respond to children&rsquo;s cues to build communication skills in the nursery</li>
<li>the range of opportunities children have to work independently in small groups for sustained periods of time</li>
<li>the confidence of staff and children in using te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori during the day</li>
<li>the opportunities for staff to take leadership roles within the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The managers acknowledge the need to further develop leadership and management skills to support the positive future of the centre. They agree that this development is required to improve outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the ownership of children&rsquo;s learning between parents and teachers</li>
<li>better identifying learning that is occurring</li>
<li>improving strategic planning.</li>
<li>making links between strategic planning, self review and professional development.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The board, managers and staff have good processes in place to provide children with a safe, secure and healthy learning environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
