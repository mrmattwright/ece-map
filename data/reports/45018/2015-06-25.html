</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Katikati Childcare Centre is located in the township of Katikati, north of Tauranga. At the time of this ERO review there were 52 children on the roll including 10 who identify as MƒÅori. Children learn and play in two age-related rooms that include 0 to 3 year olds in the Little Learners unit, and 3 to 5 year olds in the preschool room. The centre has recently been relicensed to incorporate Little Learners and the preschool under the one licence. The current licence is for 75 children including 40 up to two years of age.</p><p>The owner/licensee is well known in the Katikati community. She delegates onsite management to a centre manager. In 2014, the centre was restructured and appointments, including a new centre manager, head teachers, and teachers were made. Centre leaders are in the process of building a stable and collegial teaching team.</p><p>New philosophies have been developed with teachers for each room. The centre vision and values, policies and procedures, and expectations for teaching and learning have been reviewed and re-written. In response to the area for review and development in the 2012 ERO report, self review has been strengthened and is used to bring about improvements to centre organisation and outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive and respectful relationships with their teachers and one another in an inclusive centre culture. Parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and quickly settle on arrival. Teachers promptly respond to children‚Äôs interests, requests and care routines. They effectively manage children‚Äôs behaviour and help them make appropriate choices.</p><p>Babies and toddlers receive comfort and affirmation from their teachers and experience unhurried routines. They are encouraged to develop their independence and confidence. They use their language and gestures to make their wishes known and communicate with each other. Teachers listen to children, model language, engage in rich conversations, and use questions to encourage thoughtful responses.</p><p>Children experience a rich curriculum where they can choose activities that foster imaginative and creative play, challenge their physical skills, and develop a sense of exploration. Teachers are increasing the use and visibility of te reo MƒÅori and are using waiata to reinforce bicultural development. They integrate literacy and mathematics that are strongly evident across the centre and on the centre walls along with children‚Äôs work. Children are encouraged to participate in music, science, carpentry and excursions into the wider community.</p><p>Head teachers have introduced a new planning process, which acknowledges the interests and strengths of individual children, and considers ways to extend their learning. Teachers write meaningful learning stories that are accessible for parents in portfolios and in an on-line programme. They prepare regular summaries for parents and encourage them to discuss their child‚Äôs learning with them. These processes are likely to result in increased engagement and participation by parents and whƒÅnau. A next step for teachers is to deepen their understanding and use of current good practice in early childhood education to further improve their teaching and assessment practices.</p><p>With support from the centre manager, head teachers have been allocated time to:</p><ul>
<li>model and promote caring and respectful relationships with children and their families</li>
<li>review and improve health and safety provisions and the centre environment</li>
<li>commence an appraisal process for teachers and encourage their leadership</li>
<li>complete an annual and strategic plan</li>
<li>lead self review for improvement including planned and spontaneous self review.</li>
</ul><p>A next step is to review and clarify roles and responsibilities in the leadership team to strengthen their leadership of teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre owners, using external support, have restructured the centre and combined the two separate rooms under one licence. The appointment of new staff, including a new head teacher in each room, has made a positive difference to centre operations and the education and care for children.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>A key next step for the centre owners is to ensure that high-quality practices for children are sustained by providing greater financial support for resources, refurbishments, and the implementation of strategic goals.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Katikati Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Katikati Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
