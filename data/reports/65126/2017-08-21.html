</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Renwick Preschool is one of two independently-owned and locally-operated early childhood education services on neighbouring properties. The centre provides care and education for a small number of children from 2 years to 6 years of age.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in July 2014, there have been some changes in staffing. The current teacher began in January 2017. The centre has addressed the areas for improvement identified in the last ERO review report related to child-initiated learning, and better programme planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Centre staff have continued to access a comprehensive range of professional development. They are able to attend courses that suit their professional needs and interests.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the strong focus on intentional teaching of individuals and small groups. The calm, orderly environment is conducive to children's sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Children play well with and alongside each other. There are positive relationships among children, and between teachers and children.</p><p>Children learn through exploration and investigation of a variety of mathematical and scientific concepts. There are many opportunities for the development of literacy skills. Literacy and numeracy are integrated seamlessly into the daily programme. Creativity is encouraged through a range of high quality resources and activities.</p><p>Bicultural practices are evident in the centre through teacher practice and interesting opportunities for learning. The cultures of other children are acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective approaches to planning and assessment. They take time to observe children over several weeks before using this information, with input from parents, to plan and implement a programme specific to the child. Group planning provides interesting activities to support individual children's learning.</p><p>Teachers undertake their own evaluation of aspects of the centre's programme. These are well considered and comprehensive in their design. They lead to changes that promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The service's philosophy is evident in the centre. Teachers promote respect and sensitivity in the children and affirm diversity and inclusive practice. Children are confident learners and communicators.</p><p>The service provider supports staff well through a strong focus on professional learning and development, and through appropriate health and safety practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and managers need to seek the views of parents, staff and children through more regular surveys and other data gathering tools. It is some time since there has been a focus on seeking views on wellbeing.</p><p>There is a need to make better use of modern technologies to support children and parents. In this centre, children need access to more devices and communication technology to enable them to learn and explore their world in a wider variety of ways.</p><p>There needs to be greater alignment between the service's strategic direction and priorities, performance management processes, and internal evaluation including appraisal processes.</p><p>Some important aspects of leadership and governance are not being completed. In order to address this effectively, involvement in the roles and responsibilities of governance, leadership, and being a teacher on the floor, need to be clarified.</p><p>In order to promote positive outcomes for children, centre managers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>seek the views of parents, staff and children more frequently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use digital technologies more effectively for teaching, learning and communication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align and regularly review the centre's strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Renwick Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to appraisal. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to implement a system of regular appraisal <em>[Criterion GMA7].<br></em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Renwick Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>21 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
