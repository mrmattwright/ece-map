<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</p>
<p>Carterton Playcentre is not well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The capacity of the Wairarapa Playcentre Association (the association) to deliver and sustain high quality practices cannot be assured.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Carterton Playcentre is one of six administered by the Wairarapa Playcentre Association. The association‚Äôs executive committee‚Äôs role is to provide general guidance and support for members and centres and leadership for:</p>
<ul><li>strategic planning</li>
<li>policy development and review</li>
<li>decision making related to the education programme, property and equipment</li>
<li>training of members</li>
<li>financial management</li>
</ul><p>Since the 2009 ERO reviews of the association centres, a core group of personnel have undertaken roles at executive level. With the recent exodus of the majority of these members, the capacity of the association to provide effective governance and leadership is at risk.</p>
<p>This service offers three sessions per week, one less than at the time of the previous review. Many parents are new playcentre members.</p>
<p>For some time, a small core group has taken responsibility for managing this playcentre. Key personnel have recently stepped down from their roles as office holders and new members have come forward to replace them. A stronger sense of group commitment is emerging.</p>
<p>The centre has recently undergone a Ministry of Education relicensing inspection. Members have been informed that the service will be on a transitional licence until all requirements of the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 are met. Relicensing has become a challenging and major focus for development across the association.</p>
<p>External professional development is underway to support planning for learning and aspects of self review.</p>
<p>The centre has previously had a positive reporting history with ERO.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in five early childhood education services within the Wairarapa Playcentre Association. name of umbrella organisation</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The good quality learning environment promotes children's interest, exploration of materials and sustained play. Members are friendly, inclusive and welcoming. The calm and settled tone fosters engagement in learning. Free play and a sense of fun are valued and encouraged. Children‚Äôs creativity and self-expression are well supported and celebrated. Parents supervise well. Areas of play are spacious and well resourced. The outdoor area is popular and presents a variety of physically challenging play experiences.</p>
<p>Members have had little support to develop a MƒÅori perspective in the programme. Leaders would like to strengthen links with local iwi to support an authentic approach to implementing a bicultural programme and realising the potential of MƒÅori children.</p>
<p>Key members are benefitting from external professional support linked to programme planning and aspects of self review. This includes the support person providing feedback about progress, suggestions for next development steps and sharing resources she has developed. Work has been done to identify learning that should underpin the programme and provision of activities. Agreed next steps are:</p>
<p>for key members to implement new ideas and support other parents‚Äô understanding, including showing them how children's learning is linked to <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. This should help to develop a more collaborative, centre-wide approach based on shared understandings and good practice.</p>
<p>With key personnel leaving the centre, new members show a willingness and commitment to taking on management roles and responsibilities. Now that new office holders have been elected it is imperative that:</p>
<ul><li>support is put in place to help them meet the expectations of their roles</li>
<li>a framework is established that effectively supports emergent leadership and succession planning, in an ongoing way, for key positions in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Useful strategic and annual plans outline agreed priorities for development. There is a good range of up-to-date association guidelines to support practice at centre level and meet the documentation requirements for relicensing. There is now a need to:</p>
<ul><li>focus on developing parents‚Äô understanding of how to implement these requirements within the centre</li>
<li>develop shared understandings about self review to support, sustain and embed good practice and improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>define and implement a rigorous and useful quality assurance process at centre and association levels to ensure expectations are being met.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>ERO recommends that the association seeks support and advice from the Playcentre Federation in relation to:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing and further developing leadership and governance at executive level</li>
<li>improving the capacity of the association to carry out its role effectively.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Carterton Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>ERO identified areas of non compliance.</p>
<p>The programme of activities is not yet planned, provided and evaluated in accordance with current best practice and legislative requirements.<em>[R 32, a, b, c, e Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998]</em></p>
<p>The bark impact surfacing does not meet playground safety standards.<em>[R 17(4) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998</em>]</p>
<p>In the kitchen, which is freely accessible, there are hazards to the safety of children.<em>[R 24 (4) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998]</em></p>
<h3>Recommendations to other agencies</h3>
<p>ERO recommends that the association seeks support from the Ministry of Education to meet the requirements of the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, particularly in relation to the development of curriculum, self review and leadership to support management and governance.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p>
<p>ERO will undertake a further education review of this service when the Ministry of Education is satisfied that licensing requirements are met.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
