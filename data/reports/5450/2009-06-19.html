<a id="community-page" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Community Page</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Riccarton is one of 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre administered by the Kidsfirst Kindergartens-Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten operates within the constitution of the association. The chief executive of the association is the licensee for all centres. A voluntary parent group support the teaching team in the development of the programme by providing resources and building relationships with the community. The teaching team works well with support staff to provide education and care for children aged two to five years. An education services manager provides effective support to teachers, families and children on a regular and ongoing basis.</p><p align="left">The two-teacher team work well together. They warmly welcome all families to the kindergarten. Their daily practice is underpinned by their shared understanding of Te¬†WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum. The head teacher provides good leadership to create a learning environment that supports children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p align="left">Since the 2005 education review, teachers have encouraged parents to share their aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning. They provide time to talk with parents and decide on learning goals that are personalised for their child.</p><p align="left">Teachers have been involved in the Ministry of Education Information Communication and Technology (ICT) pilot project with other teachers throughout the early childhood, primary and secondary sectors. The association is supporting this initiative. Teachers use their ICT skills and knowledge to support children‚Äôs learning and to let parents and whƒÅnau know what is happening in the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of the kindergarten observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>children who are confident communicators and explorers,</li>
<li>independent learners who take responsibility for themselves, their peers and the environment;</li>
<li>literacy and numeracy opportunities that are well integrated into the programme;</li>
<li>teachers making good use of questioning to support children‚Äôs thinking, reasoning and problem-solving skills; and</li>
<li>teachers continually reflecting on the programme to inform their teaching practice and to provide for positive learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">There were no MƒÅori children enrolled in the kindergarten at the time of the review. ERO observed the teachers commitment to providing all children with an awareness of Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage by good use of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori.</p><p align="left">The next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children aim and to build on the good practices being followed at the time of this review, is for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>find ways to enable them to spend quality time developing the use of the English language by children who speak other languages; and</li>
<li>work with local schools, using the assessment information about children to help identify links in children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have effective systems for promoting children‚Äôs health and safety. During the on-site stage of the review, ERO found no areas of non-compliance.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Isabell Sinclair Irwin¬†<br>Area Manager<br><b>for Chief Review Officer</b></p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre‚Äôs self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO‚Äôs framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b>¬†‚Äì including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b>¬†‚Äì other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Areas of National Interest</b>¬†‚Äì information about how Government policies are working in early childhood centres.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b>¬†‚Äì assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p><a id="1-about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1.

They provide time to talk with parents and decide on learning goals that are personalised for their child.</p><p align="left">Teachers have been involved in the Ministry of Education Information Communication and Technology (ICT) pilot project with other teachers throughout the early childhood, primary and secondary sectors. The association is supporting this initiative. Teachers use their ICT skills and knowledge to support children‚Äôs learning and to let parents and whƒÅnau know what is happening in the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of the kindergarten observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>children who are confident communicators and explorers,</li>
<li>independent learners who take responsibility for themselves, their peers and the environment;</li>
<li>literacy and numeracy opportunities that are well integrated into the programme;</li>
<li>teachers making good use of questioning to support children‚Äôs thinking, reasoning and problem-solving skills; and</li>
<li>teachers continually reflecting on the programme to inform their teaching practice and to provide for positive learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">There were no MƒÅori children enrolled in the kindergarten at the time of the review.

Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Riccarton was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidsfirst Kindergartens Riccarton.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The teacher‚Äôs vision statement states that their daily practice is underpinned by their understanding of Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum. They encourage children to see themselves as explorers. The kindergarten philosophy of children learning through play provides many opportunities for children to actively find out about the world around them. They strongly value parents/whƒÅnau partnerships in their children‚Äôs learning and life at kindergarten.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><ul>
<li><em>Positive relationships.</em> Children are helpful and cooperative, and care for one another. They enjoy talking with adults and sharing what they know. They have fun with their teachers and peers. Parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed to the kindergarten. Teachers work alongside parents and consult with them regularly. Parents are comfortable about spending time at the kindergarten with their children. Teachers take time to get to know the children and families well. They value their partnership with families/whƒÅnau and their involvement with their children‚Äôs learning and in the kindergarten.</li>
<li><em>Confident competent children.</em> Children are confident communicators and explorers. They are actively involved in learning experiences for sustained periods of time. They initiate interactions with adults and peers. They are free to choose activities of interest to them. Teachers encourage children to develop friendships. Children play with and alongside others happily. They encourage and support one another and share their knowledge. They are familiar with social skills such as turn taking, following instructions and the ‚Äòrules‚Äô during group play.</li>
<li><em>Independent learners</em>. Teachers provide children with opportunities to be a leader and to take responsibility for themselves, the programme and the environment. Children discuss ideas and make decisions about the direction of their learning. They provide challenges for their own and others‚Äô learning and physical development. They use their initiative in many aspects of the programme. For example, they made decisions about what to do next when a task was completed. Children listen and respond to each other. They make positive decisions and play cooperatively.</li>
<li><em>Supporting children‚Äôs learning.</em> Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests, skills and abilities. Their daily practice is underpinned by their shared understanding of Te WhƒÅriki. Children are encouraged to discuss, question, explore and investigate their interests. Teachers make good use of questioning to develop children‚Äôs deeper levels of thinking, reasoning and problem solving. Children know what is expected of them.</li>
<li><em>Literacy.</em> Teachers provide a holistic programme that enables all children to reach their potential. They have developed a literacy and numeracy programme that is well integrated in the environment. Teachers are storytellers and story readers. Children are able to hear language in various forms. This helps develop their use of words and phrases. Teachers show children how interesting and useful books are. This strategy helps to engage children in their developing love of books. Children are provided with time and space to be involved in creative experiences of interest to them. Their reflections about their work are displayed and celebrated.</li>
<li><em>Using Information communication technology (ICT).</em> Teachers make good use of ICT to make the children‚Äôs learning visible. Children are developing new knowledge and skills through the use of ICT alongside their teachers. Both teachers in the team have been involved in the Ministry of Education ICT pilot project with other teachers throughout the early childhood, primary and secondary sectors. The teachers view themselves as life-long learners. They challenged themselves to develop skills that will support the children‚Äôs ability to respond as learners in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This year teachers are involved in using action research at the kindergarten around the use of ICT to support children as ‚Äòcompetent and confident learners‚Äô.</li>
<li><em>Stimulating environment.</em> Teachers make good use of the available space in the kindergarten. The quality resources and equipment are stored in an organised manner. Children have easy access to the learning resources. Parents are able to find books covering a wide range of topics including child development and health. The science area stimulates children‚Äôs curiosity and invites investigation. Children‚Äôs inquiry learning is supported through a range of natural and science resources. Teachers arrange the resources so that children have hands-on as well as physically challenging activities.</li>
<li><em>Programme planning and assessment.</em> Teachers have a planned approach to the programme that reflects their philosophy of developing competent confident learners. They personalise the learning to respond to the individual emerging interests of children and extending the learning that has already been established. For example they encouraging children to research ideas using reference books and computers. Children‚Äôs individual emerging interests enrich the programme and skills for all children. The teachers have developed their assessment practices and use ICT to engage and inform parents of their child‚Äôs learning. Parents learning goals and aspirations for their children are considered in the planning.</li>
<li><em>Self-review practices.</em> Teachers focus self review on improving learning outcomes for children and enhancing their teaching practice. The head teacher provides good leadership with self review and develops a clear understanding of the planning and purpose of reviews within the two teacher team. Both teachers are reflective practitioners. They follow the association‚Äôs systematic process for implementing self review. The education services manager provides professional support and guidance to the team and their progression with self review.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for improvement</h4><p align="left">The next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children aim to provide two high level challenges for the kindergarten and association that build on the good practices being followed at the time of this review.</p><ul>
<li><em>Extending learning opportunities for individuals</em>. Teachers are committed to meeting the learning and development needs of all children. The next step is for teachers to find better ways to use their support staff which will enable teachers to spend quality time working alongside children with English as a second language. [Recommendation 6.1]</li>
<li><em>Link to schools</em>. The teachers agree that links with local schools could be developed further. Their work with ICT has included some action research into developing the understanding of the community regarding the learning that takes place as children play. The teachers have improved the quality of information contained in the children‚Äôs learning profiles. Teachers recognise that partnerships with schools could be strengthened. The next step is to work in partnership with teachers in schools to recognise the educational value of this information as children make the transition to new entrant classes. One area for possible development is to emphasise the links between the skills children are developing in the kindergarten programme and the key competencies of the revised New¬†Zealand Curriculum. [Recommendation 6.2]</li>
</ul><a id="4-area-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Area of National Interest</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>MƒÅori Children</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children and focuses on the potential of MƒÅori children to develop as competent and capable learners.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><ul>
<li><em>Positive relationships.</em> Children experience caring and supportive relationships with teachers, peers and parents. Teachers are friendly and welcoming towards parents and visitors. They model positive interactions that make children comfortable and secure. Parents are happy to spend time in the kindergarten and show interest in what the children are doing. Teachers are sensitive to the cultural values of families/whƒÅnau.</li>
<li><em>Bicultural aspects</em>. Although there are no MƒÅori children enrolled in the kindergarten, the teachers are committed to providing all children with an awareness of Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. They have developed a stimulating and interesting learning environment that reflects a bicultural and multicultural focus. Teachers have a kete of knowledge containing resources to increase their knowledge and use of basic reo MƒÅori. They use te reo MƒÅori often and in context.</li>
<li><em>Holistic learning</em>. Children have access to a holistic programme that enables them to reach their potential. Teachers use their storytelling abilities to encourage children to tell their own stories. In the science area, children have opportunities to observe or investigate things of interest to them. Children have ready access to the music equipment and art and craft materials. The outdoor equipment is physically challenging. Moveable structures allow children to create situations that reflect their imagination and thinking. Children are respectful of their environment and care for all living things and for their equipment and resources.</li>
<li><em>Ako.</em> Teachers share their belief that everyone in the kindergarten is a learner and a teacher. They have high expectations that all children will learn. Children are encouraged to share their knowledge with their peers and teachers. They are also encouraged to help others to learn. Teachers demonstrate their love of learning from each other and from the children. They warmly celebrate children‚Äôs achievements and new learning. They regularly share information about the children‚Äôs learning with parents. Teachers provide educational books and resources about parenting and education in the early years for parents.</li>
<li><em>Developing independence.</em> Children have many opportunities to take a leadership role. For example, they take turns to lead the group times. They decide what the group time programme will be. Children were observed taking responsibility in a variety of ways. Some children used their initiative and cleaned up a messy area without being asked to. Other children arranged dancing, musical and physical activities for those who wished to be involved. Teachers provide immediate positive feedback. This approach strengthens children‚Äôs confidence to try things for themselves.</li>
<li><em>Consultation with parents.</em> Teachers are sensitive to the needs of the children, their parents and families/whƒÅnau. They use different approaches to seek feedback from parents. For example, some parents are happy to answer a questionnaire while others prefer to discuss matters face-to-face (kanohi-ki-te-kanohi). Teachers respond positively when they are made aware of the parents‚Äô aspirations and expectations for their children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the licensee and staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Riccarton completed an <em>ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers at the kindergarten demonstrate a high level of health and safety awareness.

Recommendations</h2><p align="left">In order to improve learning outcomes for children ERO, the teachers and the association agree that the association will support teachers to:</p><ol>
<li>find ways to enable teachers to spend quality time developing the use of the English language by children who speak other languages; and</li>
<li>work with schools to develop transition to school procedures that focus more on identifying learning linkages; and</li>
</ol><a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.
