</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kerikeri Kindergarten operates within the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA). It provides all day education for children over the age of two years, in a warm, welcoming and settled environment.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to contribute to decisions, manage routines and initiate play. They have a strong sense of belonging and ownership of the centre. Respectful interactions are evident amongst children and adults.</p><p>The experienced, mostly long serving teachers are a cohesive team. They maintain close relationships and effective communication with families. Parent feedback affirms the centre&rsquo;s valuing of family and cultures, and the care and education provided for their children.</p><p>As the kindergarten has increasing numbers of children who are two years of age, the NKA plans to provide staff with professional development focused on catering for younger children in a mixed age setting.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Staff have responded well to recommendations from the 2012 ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kerikeri Kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and programmes follow the Reggio Emilia approach to learning by responding to and provoking children&rsquo;s participation and extending their learning. Teachers interweave this approach with <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to develop high quality learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers use their in-depth knowledge of children to plan learning programmes. They include early literacy and numeracy learning in meaningful ways. The curriculum has a strong focus on sustainability and community impact, through the Enviro Education programme. High quality documentation of children&rsquo;s learning is used to ensure programmes reflect and extend children&rsquo;s individual needs and strengths. Teachers are continuing to trial innovative approaches to assessment and planning.</p><p>High quality teaching practices are evident. Teachers use good questioning to encourage higher order thinking and encourage complex play. They offer children frequent opportunities for problem solving and creative play. Sustained conversations enrich children&rsquo;s vocabulary and general knowledge.</p><p>Children are supported to be articulate, capable and confident learners. They show high levels of engagement in both independent and collaborative play. They interact very effectively with adults and initiate conversations about their own learning. They engage with other children and support each other well in tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>The attractive learning environment is well resourced, with largely natural materials that children can use in a variety of ways. The outdoor environment offers many opportunities for children to extend their physical skills.</p><p>Parents have opportunities to share their aspirations for their children and to contribute to planning decisions. They are well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers support children and their parents as children transition to school.</p><p>Teachers honour the cultural uniqueness that M&#257;ori and other children bring with them. They make good use of community resources and networks to promote te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in the kindergarten. Teachers are participating in the Pumanawatanga initiative to develop further understanding of the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The head teacher provides strong leadership. Staff work collaboratively in a culture of continuous improvement where they question, trial and innovate. A good appraisal model is being developed to encourage more formalised teacher reflection. Professional learning and development is purposeful and well considered.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s long-term and annual plans align with NKA frameworks. Kindergarten staff have a clear vision and direction that is informed by their philosophy. Teachers make good use of self review and input from staff and parents to inform the kindergarten&rsquo;s decision-making.</p><p>The NKA provides good systems and support for kindergarten administration and operation. A regularly reviewed and up-dated policy framework guides centre operations. The NKA offers teachers opportunities to contribute to, and have leadership in, the association and in other educational forums.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten staff agree that key next steps to extend current good practice could include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to review and redesign systems for documenting programme planning</li>
<li>further developing the evaluative nature of self review processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kerikeri Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kerikeri Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Northern</p><p>19 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
