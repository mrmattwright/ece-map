<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Avonhead is located in Avonhead, Christchurch. Since the June 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has made some changes to its hours of operation. The kindergarten currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age. All teachers are fully qualified and registered as early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association and the kindergarten teachers have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p align="left">Since the last review teachers have made good progress in improving the way they assess children&rsquo;s learning. Parents are well informed of ways teachers support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers have also made some good progress with establishing systems to review and improve practices.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are the:</p><ul>
<li>way children confidently care for one another and the environment</li>
<li>child-led programme, where children&rsquo;s ideas and emerging interests are valued and built on</li>
<li>focus on literacy, numeracy, dramatic play, sustainable practices and physical activities</li>
<li>well managed transitions and supportive routines that respond to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The next steps for the teachers to support the ongoing improvement of practices are to refine and strengthen aspects of programme planning and self review.</p><p align="left">Children use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in meaningful ways during group times. The teachers identified, and ERO agrees, that this is an area to further strengthen. This includes increasing opportunities to support children&rsquo;s understandings of bicultural perspectives in the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Avonhead was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidsfirst Kindergartens Avonhead.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy states that teachers aim to provide a warm and welcoming environment where children and their families are comfortable and safe. In this kindergarten, the association&rsquo;s philosophy is interpreted in a vision statement that views children as unique and special. Partnerships between children and teachers are valued. Teachers focus on providing a welcoming, safe and secure area where teachers and children learn together. The programme aims to meet the needs of its diverse community.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Relationships and interactions</strong></p><p align="left">Children benefit from caring and supportive relationships with their teachers. Parents and children are made to feel welcome. Many parents are comfortable to spend time at the kindergarten. Parent contribution to the kindergarten is valued. ERO observed teachers communicating well and working effectively together. Teachers are establishing good links with local schools that help to support the transition to school for children and families.</p><p align="left">Teachers use a wide range of effective practices to involve children in the learning programme. They make good use of questions to extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Children&rsquo;s language development and conversation skills are well supported by teachers. Teachers know children well and make good links to home. They work with children in respectful ways and are actively involved in and build on their play.</p><p><strong>Confident children</strong></p><p align="left">Children are confident to make their own choices and settle quickly at activities of interest. Most children make good use of opportunities to lead their own learning. They play well with and alongside others for sustained lengths of time. Children share ideas, play cooperatively and enjoy friendships with one another. Children&rsquo;s independence, social learning and self-help skills are well supported. They are encouraged to take responsibility for the environment and to care for others.</p><p><strong>Programme</strong></p><p align="left">The child-focused programme encourages children to develop their ideas and learning interests. Teachers provide predictable, flexible routines and transitions that are well managed and responsive to the needs of children. Features of the programme are the strong focus on literacy, numeracy, and sustainable practices. Teachers support children who have well-developed skills to extend on their imaginative and dramatic play.</p><p align="left">Parents are well informed about children&rsquo;s interests and involvement in the programme through well-presented individual profile books. These records clearly show children&rsquo;s progress, and the ways teachers support and extend their learning. Teachers have made good progress in establishing processes that help to improve aspects of the programme. There are many opportunities for parents and children to be involved in the kindergarten&rsquo;s self review.</p><p><strong>Learning environment</strong></p><p align="left">Children benefit from a spacious, well organised, natural learning environment. There are many purposeful opportunities for children to learn about sustainable practices and the living world. Children have easy access to a wide range of resources. Their physical skills are extended by teachers as a regular part of the daily programme. Teachers also make good use of the park next door to build on physical play and team sports for children. Children are actively involved in te reo M&#257;ori and tikanga M&#257;ori experiences during group times.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The next steps for the teachers to support the ongoing improvement of documentation are to refine and strengthen aspects of programme planning and self review.</p><p align="left">In programme planning:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly show the intended learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>evaluate the programme and practices teachers use and the impact of these on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>build on ways to make the programme planning more visible to parents.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In self review:</p><ul>
<li>more deeply looking at teaching and learning within planned self review.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The teachers identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to continue to increase opportunities to support children&rsquo;s understandings of bicultural practices throughout the programme.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Avonhead completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Since the June 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has made some changes to its hours of operation. The kindergarten currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age. All teachers are fully qualified and registered as early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association and the kindergarten teachers have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p align="left">Since the last review teachers have made good progress in improving the way they assess children&rsquo;s learning. Parents are well informed of ways teachers support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers have also made some good progress with establishing systems to review and improve practices.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are the:</p><ul>
<li>way children confidently care for one another and the environment</li>
<li>child-led programme, where children&rsquo;s ideas and emerging interests are valued and built on</li>
<li>focus on literacy, numeracy, dramatic play, sustainable practices and physical activities</li>
<li>well managed transitions and supportive routines that respond to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The next steps for the teachers to support the ongoing improvement of practices are to refine and strengthen aspects of programme planning and self review.</p><p align="left">Children use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in meaningful ways during group times. The teachers identified, and ERO agrees, that this is an area to further strengthen. This includes increasing opportunities to support children&rsquo;s understandings of bicultural perspectives in the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
