</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rocket Kids Early Learning Centre serves a multi-ethnic community and operates from a converted villa. The owners work together with the newly appointed centre manager to lead and manage the daily operations of the centre. The centre offers education and care for fifty children, including a maximum of sixteen children under two years old. It promotes affordable education to working families in the community. Parents have the option to choose half day sessions for children under three years of age.</p><p>The majority of staff are registered teachers. The newly appointed centre manager has begun to build a collaborative and cohesive teaching team. She works closely with the owners to promote the strategic direction and values of the centre.</p><p>The centre has a large outdoor space and separate areas for age-related groups. Transition from one area of the centre to the next is dependent on children‚Äôs readiness. Teachers work closely with parents to ensure that these changes for children are managed well.</p><p>Centre managers have responded well to address areas for development identified in ERO‚Äôs 2012 review of the centre. Significant changes have been made and a culture of ongoing improvement has been developed. The centre is focused on providing quality early childhood education and care for its community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly into the centre. They are confident and articulate about their play choices and are encouraged to follow their interests and initiate their own learning. Children‚Äôs conversations and ideas are fostered in the centre‚Äôs homely environment. They support each other when playing together and have positive relationships with adults at the centre. Teachers support children to learn as they play.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children and encourage them to enjoy activities in both indoor and outdoor play areas. Their practices reflect the importance they place on child-centred learning and on consulting children about what they want to do. Teachers use <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to develop programmes for specific groups of children and to plan in accordance with children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs bicultural curriculum has recently undergone significant improvement and teachers are using te reo MƒÅori more in the programme. Teachers could now consider ways to further develop the bicultural curriculum and also include multi-ethnic perspectives in the programme.</p><p>Staff share a collective sense of responsibility for children in the centre. They work well in teams, work actively to build good relationships with parents, and reflect the cultures of the children that attend. Parents and whƒÅnau are valued and welcomed into the centre. They relate well to teachers and enjoy opportunities provided to be part of daily centre activities and excursions. Teachers and leaders work collaboratively to build a culture of respect at the centre.</p><p>The newly appointed centre manager has implemented useful management systems. A comprehensive appraisal system is in place and new teachers are supported to achieve their professional goals. Teachers benefit from ongoing support for professional learning development to meet their specific needs.</p><p>Changes made as a result of self review are well led and monitored. The ongoing review of the centre philosophy has increased its relevance and meaning for staff. Teachers are encouraged to take on leadership roles and to utilise their professional strengths. The centre‚Äôs openness to critique and learning from advisors help managers and teachers to achieve strategic goals for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the owner and centre managers that key next steps for the centre should include a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>making better use of learning spaces for older children</li>
<li>further strengthening bicultural practices</li>
<li>continuing to improve teachers‚Äô planning, assessment and evaluation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rocket Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rocket Kids Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern Select Region</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
