</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Steps Montessori Preschool is located in Albany, North Auckland. The centre is licensed to provide full day education and care for up to 30 children from two years to six years of age. It is located within a complex of church buildings and is set up as a separate entity.</p><p>Little Steps Preschool follows the principles and practices of the Montessori philosophy, as well as those of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre’s philosophy and vision is centred on children taking an active role in their learning, developing social responsibility and learning respect for others.</p><p>The preschool caters for a diverse multi-cultural group of children, the largest proportion being of Chinese ethnicity. A high ratio of teachers ensures that all children are well known and cared for.</p><p>Little Steps Montessori Preschool is privately owned by a charitable trust. The preschool is run by two directors, a head teacher and a lead teacher. The head teacher and lead teacher form the management team who operate the preschool. They are supported by three registered teachers and one teacher in training.</p><p>The centre has been operating since 2014. Embedding good practices and thoughtfully considering the preschool’s next steps have been key areas of focus since opening. Priorities have included building relationships with families and improving the resources of the learning environment.</p><p>This is ERO’s first review of Little Steps Montessori Preschool.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families benefit from a calm environment that is welcoming and friendly. Children are respectful of the learning resources and familiar with centre routines. They have easy access to specialised Montessori equipment in a spacious, attractive and well organised environment. The equipment provides a broad range of learning activities that are purposefully designed to develop children’s independent learning skills.</p><p>The purpose-built outdoor space is well designed and offers a range of physical activities and equipment to promote children’s learning and development. The daily outdoor programme provides children with the opportunity to explore and follow their own interests. Children learn about the natural environment through the activities provided.</p><p>Children play for sustained periods of time and work both independently and in groups. They experience trusting relationships with teachers. Teachers know children well and support them to use the resources appropriately. The programme builds children’s capability in literacy and numeracy. A range of teaching and learning strategies support children at an unhurried pace.</p><p>Teachers include te reo Māori in greetings, waiata, reading and numeracy learning. The management team acknowledge the need to continue strengthening bicultural practices and ensure this commitment is included in the preschool’s philosophy.</p><p>Regular excursions into the community provide broader learning opportunities for children to learn about their surroundings. Family events and cultural festivals promote a sense of belonging for children and families.</p><p>Preschool teachers support children’s transition to school, and are developing useful links with schools in the local area. The management team agrees it is timely to review and strengthen learning opportunities for older children so that six year olds are better prepared for starting school.</p><p>Information shared by parents is appreciated and used to build teachers’ relationships with individual children and their families. Parents value the interactive electronic portfolios showing their child’s learning journey. ERO and the management team have identified the need to increase learning partnerships with families by using Chinese language in newsletters and other forms of communication.</p><p>Teachers document how children make learning progress. They use this information effectively to guide children to the next task in the Montessori curriculum. Teachers continue to refine their evaluation practice to meet the needs and interests of each child. They continue to explore ways to promote children’s curiosity and strengths to extend their learning. Children’s individual interests and developments are becoming more apparent in teachers’ learning stories.</p><p>The trust board is very supportive of the management team and the staff. Centre managers have high expectations of teachers and aim to provide high quality programmes for children. They are justifiably proud of their journey so far. Staff work cooperatively and plan programmes collaboratively. Leadership is shared and responsibilities are delegated amongst the teaching team.</p><p>Centre management is developing well. Systems for achieving high quality care and positive educational outcomes for children are being reviewed and refined. Policies and practices are regularly monitored and evaluated. The purpose of self review is aligned to the centre’s vision, and is beginning to serve a variety of improvement-focused perspectives.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees that key next steps, identified by the centre managers and director, are to use external professional support to:</p><ul>
<li>align the mission and vision statements with the preschool’s philosophy</li>
<li>reflect the values of the Montessori approach and <em>Te Whāriki</em> in the programme for children</li>
<li>continue to use the teacher appraisal system to review teacher performance against indicators of good practice</li>
<li>improve centre practices through effective self-review processes</li>
<li>continue to strengthen leadership capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Steps Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b> </b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Steps Montessori Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
