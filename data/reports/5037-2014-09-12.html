</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunnynook Kindergarten, in Auckland, previously operated under the name of Broadlands Kindergarten. The kindergarten provides early education and care for up to 40 children from two to five years of age. In term one 2014, the kindergarten changed to the Kindergarten Day Model. This model allows families to have the option of enrolling their children for either six hour days or for four hour morning sessions.</p><p>The kindergarten is committed to its philosophy of providing a challenging environment where children become problem-solvers and develop good social competencies and self esteem. The curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children‚Äôs emerging interests are supported by teachers.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report suggested several strategies to improve learning outcomes for children. This included improving self review, strengthening te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme, and providing more complex learning opportunities for children. The report also suggested that teachers continue to develop more formal planning and evaluation processes. The kindergarten has responded well in most of these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and caring toward one another. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident where older children are mindful of the needs of younger children. Children display a good sense of belonging and are respectful of their peers and adults in the learning environment. Children are focused, independent learners. Many enjoy playing in inclusive groups that bring together girls and boys, and children from diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers provide a good variety of learning opportunities for children. The learning environment is well organised and children choose from a selection of equipment in accordance with their interests. Some te reo and tikanga practices are evident in the programme, and aspects of children‚Äôs learning about Te Ao MƒÅori, the MƒÅori world, are displayed. Teachers have been researching ways to enrich their use of te reo and bicultural practices in the kindergarten.</p><p>Professional development has helped teachers to focus more effectively on planning for the learning of individuals as well as groups of children. Parents contribute their ideas to planning. Children‚Äôs learning dispositions, such as resilience, are fostered as important attitudes that strengthen their learning abilities. Children with special learning needs are well supported. They benefit from individual learning plans that are developed by teachers and parents in collaboration with specialist services.</p><p>The teaching team works together well. The head teacher has supported teachers‚Äô development over time. She encourages them to take responsibility and lead in areas that are of interest to them. This leadership approach encourages teachers to research topics, or attend relevant training courses, to further increase their professional knowledge and skills. The teaching team encourage one another‚Äôs growth and share new learning with each other.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association has well established systems for self review and accountability to guide kindergarten management, and it continues to provide effective governance for kindergartens. The AKA has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to implementing strategies that support kindergartens in promoting positive outcomes for all children. Kindergartens have clear strategic goals, which closely link to those of the Association. This framework guides the vision for the kindergarten and its annual planning and is reflected in teachers' appraisal goals. The Association is currently reviewing the appraisal process for all kindergartens.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the Professional Services Manager and ERO agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of annual and strategic planning</li>
<li>formalising approaches for developing and implementing a bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>further building teachers‚Äô professional capacity and leadership skills</li>
<li>strengthening learning partnerships with parents through shared access to kindergarten computer programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunnynook Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunnynook Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
