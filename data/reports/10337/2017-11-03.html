</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (19) Greville is a well established service in Browns Bay. It provides full day learning programmes for up to 126 children including a maximum of 41 aged under two years. About half of the children attending the centre are Chinese, and there are increasing numbers of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The philosophy and vision of "safe, loved, learning" underpins all practices and developments in the centre. It focuses strongly on children learning by doing, and the importance of learning partnerships with families.</p><p>The centre manager leads a large team of qualified teachers. The teaching team is committed to supporting children to become independent, resilient, capable and confident learners.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. It continues to be well led and managed. Since the last review the centre has strengthened self- review and enhanced child choice, respectful care practices and parents' input into learning programmes.</p><p>The Kindercare Learning Centres' governance and management organisation has a wide range of systems that underpin centre operations. These include policies, professional development and mentoring programmes for teachers and support programmes for parents.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews of Kindercare centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the very well resourced centre. Children settle quickly, play well alongside each other and enthusiastically join in group learning activities. They display independence and freely access a wide range of high quality resources. Experienced teachers nurture respectful relationships and children‚Äôs wellbeing and an inclusive culture is evident in all seven learning areas of the centre.</p><p>The quality of care and learning is consistent throughout the centre and there is a calm unhurried pace. Children engage well with their teachers and with the responsive, child centred programme. Children of all ages benefit from having a dedicated key teacher who plans interesting and inviting provocations and activities in response to children's individual interests. Children have extended periods of uninterrupted play that enable them to sustain their interest in activities.</p><p>The programme is well aligned with the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Literacy and numeracy are integrated into activities and play throughout the day. Leaders and teachers continue to reflect on and consider ways to provide additional challenge for capable learners.</p><p>Children aged up to two years are settled and comfortable and experience warm interactions with their teachers. Teachers actively engage with children and provide many opportunities for them to learn through play. They keep parents very well informed of their children‚Äôs day at the centre.</p><p>Transitions between the various rooms in the centre are managed very well. Teachers and parents work in partnership to plan appropriate transition processes. Parents are able to spend as much time as needed with children as they settle into a new room. A specific programme for older children promotes independence, resilience and self-management skills. These skills should support children as they transition to school.</p><p>Teachers work well as a collaborative team, readily communicating with each other and responding quickly to children‚Äôs learning needs. Teachers extend children's thinking and vocabulary through the inquiry based programme and learning provocations. Children's individual learning progress is evaluated regularly and documented through a web-based communication system.</p><p>Teachers seamlessly weave te reo MƒÅori through the programme and use te reo in waiata and in centre displays. Leaders plan to continue building teachers' knowledge of and capability in te reo and tikanga in their multicultural setting.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and reflect children‚Äôs cultures well. Bilingual teachers support children and families whose first language is not English. Leaders and teachers have a sound understanding of parents' aspirations and values. They continue to respond well to the challenge of building effective communication channels with the increasingly diverse community.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective practitioners and there is a very strong focus on continual improvement. The centre emphasises teachers' professional learning and their development as leaders. Professional learning programmes and internal evaluation have impacted positively on the programme and outcomes for children.</p><p>Internal evaluation has become an integral part of the centre and has informed numerous changes, including enhanced learning environments, new menus and improved care routines. The centre is well placed to evaluate the impact of changes made and continue strengthening provision for children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified useful next steps to build on existing good practices, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>coaching and mentoring teachers in the centre's culture of intentional teaching and respectful care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teachers' knowledge and capability in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing learning partnerships with the increasingly diverse community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying ways to increase challenges for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre (19) Greville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centre (19) Greville will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>3 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
