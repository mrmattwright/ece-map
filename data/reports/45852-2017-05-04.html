</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Li'l Champs Educare is in Blockhouse Bay and was opened in 2012 in a renovated house. Since then, there has been a change of ownership and most staff have continued at the centre. The centre has a separate play area and sleeping room for children under two.</p><p>Li'l Champs Educare provides either all day education and care or sessions, for 49 children including 15 up to two years of age. Children benefit from high teacher:child ratios.</p><p>At the heart of the centre’s philosophy is the goal of children experiencing learning, love and laughter. This philosophy emphasises children enjoying their learning as they develop skills and relationships.</p><p>The centre has six qualified teachers, four of whom are provisionally registered. The centre manager/supervisor, is a fully qualified and experienced teacher. Teachers have participated in professional development in planning, learning stories and self review.</p><p>ERO's 2014 review resulted in the centre accessing Ministry of Education professional learning support. A development plan addressed key issues and helped to progress centre operations and teacher practices. Since then, teachers have built on and sustained some good practices in their positive approach to children's learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme for children is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre's philosophy is enacted well. Learning through play is prioritised and children’s choices are respected.</p><p>The programme is responsive to children's individual interests and offers a range of engaging activities. Children are viewed as capable and confident learners. They are encouraged to develop independence and to learn through ako (reciprocal learning) and tuakana/teina (younger and older children learning from each other). Children enjoy a varied programme which includes excursions into the community.</p><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and are very settled in the centre. Children are social, talkative and show their enjoyment and persistence in play. They experience learning and care in a positive and supportive environment. Children up to the age of two experience flexible, sensitive and responsive care routines.</p><p>Portfolios of learning are attractive and provide whānau with regular and valuable information about their child's learning.</p><p>The centre’s learning environments are attractive. Providing further opportunities for wonder, curiosity and creativity in the programme would increase children's learning.</p><p>Children benefit from staff who model te reo Māori and waiata. Staff have identified the further learning and incorporating of te reo me ōna tikanga in the daily programme as a professional goal. Pacific children are respected and included in the centre.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming, friendly and approachable. They reflect the children’s cultural backgrounds and promote children's wellbeing and inclusion. Parents appreciate support from teachers in an inclusive, family friendly environment.</p><p>Professional development has helped teachers establish operating processes and systems and effective practices that impact positively on children's learning. Teachers are encouraged to take on responsibility and to develop leadership, which will promote sustainable practices.</p><p>The centre has responded well to the areas for review and development identified in ERO's 2014 report. The centre's policy framework is being updated to align with the <em>Vulnerable Children's Act</em> and the new Health and Safety legislation. Performance management systems are established but require updating to align with the current Practising Teachers' Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers agree next steps to improve centre practices include:</p><ul>
<li>evaluating key strategic goals using quality indicators in internal evaluation to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>ensuring the provision of learning through play continues to promote children’s exploration, creativity and oral language</li>
<li>promoting further opportunities for te reo me ōna tikanga Māori in the programme</li>
<li>strengthening performance management processes to guide teachers to meet all the Practising Teachers' Criteria</li>
<li>ensuring policies and procedures are rationalised and clearly aligned with licensing criteria changes. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Li'l Champs Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO discussed the usefulness of aquiring an assurance from the neighbouring Auckland City Council property regarding the safety of an overhanging tree.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Li'l Champs Educare will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
