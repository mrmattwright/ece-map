<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Redhills Community Kindergarten Inc, is a well established, non-profit early childhood education centre located in Massey, Auckland. Full day and sessional options are offered for children over the age of two years.</p><p align="left">A welcoming and settled environment builds children&rsquo;s confidence and sense of belonging. Respectful interactions are evident amongst children and adults. Parents speak appreciatively of the family atmosphere, effective communication and inclusive transition processes.</p><p align="left">The learning environment is well organised and attractive, and invites exploration. Children happily play individually, in pairs or in groups. Teachers respond appropriately, with considered interventions and a commitment to encouraging sustained play and independence. They could now consider further ways to maximise learning opportunities and to increase the complexity of children&rsquo;s play.</p><p align="left">Staff have continued to improve planning and assessment and self-review practices. A clear planning and evaluation process enables the teaching team to collaboratively assess and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and needs. Programmes are guided by children&rsquo;s interests and aligned with Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. The supervisor and staff are considering ways in which parents and children can play a greater part in planning and assessment practices, to further strengthen the learning partnership between teachers and families/wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review, management roles have been redefined and clarified to increase shared understanding of centre operation and practices. Managers and staff work effectively as a collaborative team. The experienced supervisor provides clear direction, has an inclusive leadership style, and models reflective practice. The supervisor and teachers agree that they could further refine their established selfreview processes to enable more in-depth analysis and evaluation of all aspects of centre operations and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">Staff commitment to increasing the visibility of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori helps to create the welcoming and inclusive centre environment. Staff demonstrate a continued commitment to developing partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Redhills Community Kindergarten Inc was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atRedhills Community Kindergarten Inc.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 report identified many positive features of the kindergarten. These included a well organised programme and environment, settled and engaged children and supportive interactions. These good practices remain notable features of the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">The supervisor has responded well to ERO&rsquo;s 2008 recommendations by continuing to strengthen self-review and consultation practices. She continues to lead centre development effectively.</p><h4 align="left">Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Positive relationships. Interactions between children reflect children&rsquo;s pleasure in playing together. Teachers model positive relationships and foster children&rsquo;s social competence. They use their knowledge of families to engage children, and children and their families feel a strong sense of belonging at the centre. Parents affirm the centre&rsquo;s family atmosphere and teachers&rsquo; sensitive approach to the care of their children. They view communication as a strength of the kindergarten, commenting that they are well informed about children&rsquo;s routines and engagement in learning activities. Since the 2008 ERO review, teachers and the parent committee have continued to enhance home/kindergarten communication, including greater use of email.</p><p align="left">Areas of play. Vibrant, well resourced and well maintained areas of play engage children in a variety of learning experiences. Space is thoughtfully utilised to ensure flexibility in layout and ease of movement. Children are able to access equipment easily, and move confidently between areas to explore and sustain their interest. The outdoor area maximises natural materials and space to encourage physical activity and exploration. Despite being located away from the main building the outdoor area is well managed to maintain easy access for children.</p><p align="left">Attractive displays. The kindergarten environment is bright and colourful. Displayed material is varied, well presented, and reflects the value that staff place on family and on children&rsquo;s inclusion in the programme. Information is displayed about the value of learning through play. Notice boards in the entrance foyer provide good information about the centre and community. Uses of te reo M&#257;ori are clearly reflected in the centre environment, and te reo is used increasingly in teacher-children interactions.</p><p align="left">Teaching and learning. Teachers use considered intervention strategies and skilful questioning to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and ideas. They provide options for children to promote their independence and decision-making. Children&rsquo;s early literacy is promoted as part of their play and is supported by the print-rich environment.</p><p align="left">Planning and assessment. Effective planning and assessment practices enable teachers to take a collaborative approach to supporting children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers are continuing to develop child-focused practices that are responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Learning is documented through individual and group learning stories, and children&rsquo;s art and other displayed work is annotated with descriptions of the learning that has taken place. Information around the value of learning through play is displayed in the relevant learning areas. Managers and staff are exploring other strategies to extend parents&rsquo; understanding of how their children learn and how they can be more involved in the child/teacher/parent learning partnership.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Reflection on teaching practice. The supervisor should continue to lead reflection around aspects of teaching practice, such as:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">how the team can ensure a balance between formal teaching of literacy and numeracy during group times and the integration of literacy and numeracy through play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">ways in which teachers can more consistently develop the complexity of children&rsquo;s play through high quality questioning and discussions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">maximising spontaneous teaching opportunities to engage children, build on their natural curiosity and respond to their emerging interests.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">Self review. An established and considered approach to self review continues to support centre development. Planned operational, programme and policy reviews are complemented by spontaneous reviews undertaken as needs arise. The use of indicators of good practice to guide self review is providing a framework for teacher dialogue and professional learning, and should be further utilised in targeted areas of review. Managers and teachers have initiated strategies to increase consultation and the involvement of the committee, parents and children in review processes<b>.</b></p><p align="left">Current self-review practices provide a sound foundation for further development. ERO and centre leaders agree that building on self-review practices could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">encouraging teachers to think more critically about teaching practice and to record their findings as part of centre self-review processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">evaluating and further improving programmes and practices to ensure alignment with the kindergarten philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">extending practices to more obviously reflect the multi-cultural nature of the kindergarten and the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">developing strategies to document input from parents and children within the self-review cycle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">using self review to inform strategic planning and direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Ten children in this kindergarten have M&#257;ori heritage. Warm, inclusive relationships continue to be evident in interactions between staff, parents and children. In response to ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review, managers and teachers have made significant improvements to resources and programmes. A staff member skilled in te reo M&#257;ori has been appointed and is supporting teachers to develop a greater understanding of tikanga M&#257;ori and greater confidence in using te reo Ma&#333;ri.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">While it is too early to evaluate the impact of the following new directions, the kindergarten has shown its commitment to continuing to strengthen the partnership with the wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children through:</p><ul>
<li>attending external professional learning and development that has included an emphasis on strengthening relationships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau</li>
<li>a parent survey that has enabled kindergarten staff to identify key people in the community to help consolidate the partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>recent use of Ministry of Education guidelines to evaluate the extent to which staff are building an effective partnership with parents/wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">ERO and the kindergarten teachers agree that their priorities for development and review are to:</p><p align="left">review the kindergarten philosophy to ensure that it reflects New Zealand&rsquo;s dual heritage and the importance of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua</p><p align="left">document, in its strategic and annual plans, the centre&rsquo;s direction for meaningful integration of biculturalism and partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</p><p align="left">further develop practices that specifically acknowledge and value M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s identity and culture.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Redhills Community Kindergarten Inc completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist.

<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>

Full day and sessional options are offered for children over the age of two years.</p><p align="left">A welcoming and settled environment builds children&rsquo;s confidence and sense of belonging. Respectful interactions are evident amongst children and adults. Parents speak appreciatively of the family atmosphere, effective communication and inclusive transition processes.</p><p align="left">The learning environment is well organised and attractive, and invites exploration. Children happily play individually, in pairs or in groups. Teachers respond appropriately, with considered interventions and a commitment to encouraging sustained play and independence. They could now consider further ways to maximise learning opportunities and to increase the complexity of children&rsquo;s play.</p><p align="left">Staff have continued to improve planning and assessment and self-review practices. A clear planning and evaluation process enables the teaching team to collaboratively assess and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and needs. Programmes are guided by children&rsquo;s interests and aligned with Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. The supervisor and staff are considering ways in which parents and children can play a greater part in planning and assessment practices, to further strengthen the learning partnership between teachers and families/wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review, management roles have been redefined and clarified to increase shared understanding of centre operation and practices. Managers and staff work effectively as a collaborative team. The experienced supervisor provides clear direction, has an inclusive leadership style, and models reflective practice. The supervisor and teachers agree that they could further refine their established selfreview processes to enable more in-depth analysis and evaluation of all aspects of centre operations and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">Staff commitment to increasing the visibility of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori helps to create the welcoming and inclusive centre environment. Staff demonstrate a continued commitment to developing partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
