</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This review (2018) identifies the service as Well Placed. However, many of the improvements are very recent and need further development. For this reason, ERO requires an action plan that describes how the centre, with the ongoing support of the Evolve Education Group, will continue to strengthen leadership, curriculum, and health and safety practices.</p><p>Lollipops Pegasus is part of the Evolve Education Group (EEG). It provides full-day education and care for up to 65 children, including 16 under two year olds. Children play and learn in two classrooms, according to their age and readiness for the next area. Older children play in an inviting outdoor area. There is a separate outdoor area for younger children which provides opportunities for exploration and physical play. The service provides all meals and is part of the Healthy Heart programme.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 review, there has been a number of staff changes within the service. Some changes are very recent. A new centre manager was appointed in May 2017, and a new head teacher in July 2018. The centre manager oversees the day-to-day running of the service and is supported by two head teachers and a team of teachers. Most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The EEG area manager and curriculum leaders provide ongoing support and have oversight of the service.</p><p>Leaders, teachers and whƒÅnau have developed a guiding vision and philosophy for the service that is inspired by a Reggio Emilia approach and consistent with the Lollipops brand. They aim to, 'ignite creative minds, and inspire a love of learning'.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Lollipops Pegasus enjoy positive relationships with each other and their teachers. They are settled and engaged in their play. They have many opportunities for exploration, free play and to make choices in their learning. Infants and toddlers benefit from primary caregiving, where they have close nurturing relationships with their teachers and learn in a calm, unhurried environment.</p><p>Lollipops Pegasus receives very good support from the EEG. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular coaching, mentoring and support from the area manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the provision of additional professional support for managing the daily operations of the service and ongoing professional learning and development for leaders and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>useful policy and operational frameworks that provide guidance and expectations for effective practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre is at the very early stages of implementing systems and processes aimed at lifting the quality of teaching and learning. Recent initiatives include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the development of a robust strategic plan, philosophy and learning priorities to guide the centre direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making better use of the skills and strengths in the team and growing leadership within the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have developed a positive team culture and are committed to making ongoing improvements to the service. However, ERO's evaluation has identified that the leaders and teachers need to give greater urgency and commitment to sustaining and making further improvements to shift and lift practice in key areas. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing all teachers' knowledge and understanding of Te Whariki (2017), the early childhood curriculum, to design and implement a rich, local-bicultural curriculum aligned to the service's priorities for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build teachers' understanding and use of effective assessment, planning and evaluation, including showing how they recognise and respond to MƒÅori children's and other learners' language, culture and identity, and parents' wishes for their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to grow leadership capability and ensure that leaders implement robust appraisal processes that meet the EEG expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing all teachers' knowledge and use of effective internal-evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that reporting at all levels of the service is evaluative and focusses on how well the service is promoting and improving outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that all health and safety and legislative requirements are maintained and consistently meet EEG requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The EEG have developed a more coherent structure and strategic direction for the company. A strategic focus is to lift the quality of teaching and learning. Many new initiatives have been introduced to improve the effectiveness and monitor the quality of the services within the company.</p><p>Key next steps for the EEG southern region are to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>that the company vision, values, philosophy, goals and systems reflect and enact the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and are underpinned by te ao MƒÅori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative and show how outcomes for all children have been improved, especially in relation to the organisation‚Äôs vision, philosophy and valued outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing monitoring of the new initiatives and roles and responsibilities of personnel in positions of leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Lollipops Pegasus leaders and teachers are to make the improvements outlined in this report.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO requests that Lollipops Pegasus:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop an action plan that clearly describes how it will respond to ERO's recommendations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sends to ERO six month and 12 month reports on its progress.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Pegasus completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Pegasus will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>31 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
