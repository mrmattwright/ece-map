<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Taiaotea Kindergarten provides early childhood care and education for children and their families in Browns Bay. The kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides professional support and management guidance.</p>
<p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has adopted the kindergarten day model of operation, providing four six-hour sessions and one shorter four-hour session. The kindergarten building has been significantly upgraded and extended.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers provide child-centred and child-initiated programmes that strongly reflect their philosophy statements. Teachers believe that children learn best through play. They provide a blend of traditional activities and experiences and focus on children&rsquo;s individual interests and strengths. Activities to extend children&rsquo;s understanding of life skills, such as fire safety, are valuable inclusions in the programme.</p>
<p align="left">Children settle quickly to their chosen activities. Flexible routines allow them to explore their interests and to develop dramatic play together. The kindergarten environment is attractively arranged. Clearly differentiated play areas are inviting and interesting. The extensive range of high quality equipment and resources enables children to extend their play in meaningful ways. Some teachers are skilful in extending children&rsquo;s ideas through conversation. Teachers could now explore further opportunities for children to contribute to planning.</p>
<p align="left">The recently increased teaching team is working together effectively. Teachers plan to continue developing the reflective nature of their discussions to further strengthen teamwork and to ensure consistency of approaches with children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Taiaotea Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTaiaotea Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO report noted that teachers were skilled at encouraging children to respond to challenges and that they valued children&rsquo;s imaginative and creative play. Teachers also valued the relationships they were building with families.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left"><em>Leadership and self review.</em> The head teacher provides positive modelling in her interactions and support of children&rsquo;s play. She has established a reflective and evaluative approach to the teaching team&rsquo;s work and encourages teachers to take responsibility for different aspects of the programme.</p>
<p align="left">The management of the kindergarten is well organised and efficient. Formal selfreview processes are clearly documented. Teachers have identified the need to record more incidental reviews and to review their statements of teaching practice more explicitly throughout the year.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Programme management.</em> Teachers record individual and group learning stories in children&rsquo;s portfolios. These provide a good record of children&rsquo;s time in the kindergarten. Planning is a blend of responses to children&rsquo;s interests and teachers&rsquo; ideas about topics for study. The kindergarten has significant displays of photographs showing individual children&rsquo;s explorations of their interests, and accounts of events for parent information. These displays reflect the value teachers place on children&rsquo;s ideas and give them opportunities to revisit previous activities.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Teaching and learning.</em> Teachers are respectful and appreciative when they talk to children. They recognise children&rsquo;s competence and capability and have clear expectations that children will engage in learning as they play. Teachers generally work closely with children, supporting their play and engaging them in conversation.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Outcomes for children.</em> Children are confident and settled. They select and direct their own play, negotiating towards shared outcomes. They have good manners and are developing effective social relationships in their play with others. They are accomplished communicators and trust adults to support their play.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Learning environment.</em> Teachers have created an interesting and accessible playing space for children. Different types of play are clearly identified and well resourced. Children enjoy a good flow of play from the indoor area to the deck and the outdoor area. The playground arrangement, with a vegetable garden and attractive native plantings, fosters children&rsquo;s understanding of the need to care for nature. Playground equipment encourages children&rsquo;s physical activity. A strong focus on health and safety is evident.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Partnerships with families.</em> Parents report that the welcoming relationships teachers have with them make them feel comfortable in the kindergarten. They stay to settle their children and to join in with activities and events. They are well informed and value the time teachers take to keep them up to date with their children&rsquo;s progress and development.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">ERO and teachers agree that next steps for kindergarten development are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>place a greater focus on outcomes for children in reviewing their practices</li>
<li>use questioning more consistently to gain information about children&rsquo;s ideas and thinking</li>
<li>simplify the language they use in displays so that parents can understand children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>provide greater support for children&rsquo;s extension of their own learning and interests, and include children in planning</li>
<li>know more about parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children</li>
<li>use self review and reflection to guide improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Teachers are aware of the need to focus on children&rsquo;s opportunities to learn early skills in literacy, mathematics and information and communication technologies (ICT) literacy through their play.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align="left">Five children who identify as M&#257;ori attend the kindergarten. As part of this ERO review, two wh&#257;nau completed written responses and two wh&#257;nau were interviewed.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p align="left">M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau report that they appreciate the efforts teachers have made to incorporate te reo M&#257;ori and M&#257;ori culture as strong components in their programmes for children. Each year all staff participate in ongoing professional development relating to bi-cultural practice in the centre. The impact of this learning is evident in the environment, the use of te reo M&#257;ori, the availability of resources with M&#257;ori themes, and in celebrations of important festivals. Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children have been invited to consider and approve plans for such events and have willingly contributed their expertise.</p>
<p align="left">Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children recognise the progress teachers are making in increasing their understanding of te reo M&#257;ori and in strengthening their partnership with wh&#257;nau. Wh&#257;nau spoken with during this review said that they would support teachers to include more information in children&rsquo;s portfolios about their M&#257;ori heritage. They would also favour greater opportunities for their children to see M&#257;ori culture in practice, and to learn more about the M&#257;ori history of the local community. ERO supports these aspirations.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Taiaotea Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-taiaotea-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Taiaotea Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Taiaotea Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Taiaotea Kindergarten provides early childhood care and education for children and their families in Browns Bay. The kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides professional support and management guidance.</p>
<p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has adopted the kindergarten day model of operation, providing four six-hour sessions and one shorter four-hour session. The kindergarten building has been significantly upgraded and extended.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers provide child-centred and child-initiated programmes that strongly reflect their philosophy statements. Teachers believe that children learn best through play. They provide a blend of traditional activities and experiences and focus on children&rsquo;s individual interests and strengths. Activities to extend children&rsquo;s understanding of life skills, such as fire safety, are valuable inclusions in the programme.</p>
<p align="left">Children settle quickly to their chosen activities. Flexible routines allow them to explore their interests and to develop dramatic play together. The kindergarten environment is attractively arranged. Clearly differentiated play areas are inviting and interesting. The extensive range of high quality equipment and resources enables children to extend their play in meaningful ways. Some teachers are skilful in extending children&rsquo;s ideas through conversation. Teachers could now explore further opportunities for children to contribute to planning.</p>
<p align="left">The recently increased teaching team is working together effectively. Teachers plan to continue developing the reflective nature of their discussions to further strengthen teamwork and to ensure consistency of approaches with children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
