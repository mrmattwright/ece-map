</table><p>The centre is currently participating in professional development to improve programme planning and assessment practices. Self-review workshops are planned for 2015. ERO has identified some additional areas for review and development. All these aspects need to be in place for the service to be well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre is located on the grounds of the Hagley Community College. It is supported by a Charitable Trust that is responsible to the college‚Äôs board of trustees. Children and teachers have access to college facilities such as the on-site nurse, and the library.</p><p>The majority of staff are long serving and qualified. The ratio of teachers to children is very good and provides opportunities for one-to-one support for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre has made some progress in addressing the recommendations from the January 2011 ERO report. A Ministry of Education intervention in 2013 has resulted in some changes in direction and improvements in the way teachers plan and assess children‚Äôs learning. Progress in these areas is at an early stage of development.</p><p>Professional development, funded by the Ministry, is helping staff to improve teaching practices to support positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have positive relationships with each other and with adults in the centre. At the time of the review, children were happy, sociable and friendly. Teachers were nurturing and supportive and used children‚Äôs views to support decisions about their learning direction and appropriate resources.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre and feel comfortable to remain in the programme to settle their children.</p><p>Teachers have a strong focus on supporting children to be competent and confident learners. Children have easy access to resources and make own their choices about their play. ERO observed some children playing independently or in small groups, for long periods of time with particular resources.</p><p>Teachers follow children‚Äôs emerging interests by planning learning experiences that extend children‚Äôs thinking and develop their ongoing curiosity.</p><p>Teachers of infants and toddlers effectively support children‚Äôs developing language by:</p><ul>
<li>observing, interpreting and positively responding to children‚Äôs gestures</li>
<li>modelling new vocabulary to support children‚Äôs growing curiosity.</li>
</ul><p>The recent development of a policy that focuses on positive behaviour management has contributed to consistent use of effective teaching strategies. These include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers having clear expectations for behaviour by redirecting unsettled learners</li>
<li>proactively acknowledging positive behaviours through praise and encouragement</li>
<li>allowing children time to explore resources in an unhurried way.</li>
</ul><p>Programme planning is developing and includes some effective practices. There are strong links to the centre‚Äôs philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Teachers plan together as a team and share ideas from the children‚Äôs ideas and interests. In the under two-year-old area, individual goals guide planning and assessments.</p><p>Assessment practices are supporting the developing strengths and interests of children. Learning profiles include good examples of the development of new skills, children‚Äôs interests and identify what teachers will do to develop this new learning.</p><p>Teachers in the infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô area are taking active steps to include parents‚Äô ideas in children‚Äôs assessments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, there are a number of key next steps the centre should implement to improve learning for children.</p><p>Programme planning and evaluation need to include a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>embedding new planning practices</li>
<li>ensuring that responses in learning stories focus on how teachers will extend children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>increasing collaboration with parents and children</li>
<li>strengthening programme evaluations</li>
<li>extending children‚Äôs language development in mathematics, science and literacy.</li>
</ul><p>Consultation with MƒÅori was identified in the 2011 ERO report and has yet to be addressed. The centre needs to seek the aspirations of parents of MƒÅori children to succeed as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre has identified partnerships with parents as an area for review in 2015 and ERO agrees. This review could include:</p><ul>
<li>providing greater support to parents when their children transition to school</li>
<li>identifying ways teaching practices and strategies promote the language, culture and identity of children from other cultures.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified key areas for review and development that will strengthen centre practices and the future direction of the service. They include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the appraisal system and improving the evaluative feedback to teachers</li>
<li>monitoring progress of the centre towards meeting annual and strategic goals</li>
<li>reviewing outcomes and identifying the next steps for improvement.</li>
</ul><p>Centre staff have participated in professional development to increase their understanding and use of self review. The next steps are to continue to develop a plan and process for self review and consolidate and embed new practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hagley Community College Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hagley Community College Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer - Southern</p><p>10 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
