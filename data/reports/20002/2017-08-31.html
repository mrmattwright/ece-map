</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Albany Community Preschool is next to a bush and recreation reserve close to Albany Village and Massey University. The centre has a strong relationship with the local Albany community and is governed by a committee of parent representatives. It provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years of age.</p><p>The centre has a very committed and long serving teaching team. A manager and head teacher have oversight of the day to day running of the centre and work closely with the centre's management committee.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report noted that areas for review and development included the curriculum, the impact of routines on children's learning, and the use of self review as a tool for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children are valued and respected for their individuality and have appropriate choices in the programme. They are keen inquirers who are provided with good resources and play opportunities. Children have meaningful conversations with each other and with adults and play happily, either individually or cooperatively with friends.</p><p>Children benefit from a caring and nurturing environment. Teachers interact respectfully with children and respond to the needs of each individual child with sensitivity. Importance is placed on listening to children and parents. This is a feature of interactions in the centre and reflects the good relationships that teachers have with parents.</p><p>Children explore stimulating and attractive environments, and have opportunities to play for sustained periods of time. Resources support play and learning, and reflect children's collective interests or significant events. A special feature of the outdoor environment is a focus on nurturing rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens and butterflies. Children are knowledgeable about the various life cycles of these creatures, and develop caring attitudes and skills.</p><p>The outdoor environment is expansive and exciting for children to explore, and promotes their creativity. The indoor environment is organised to provide learning opportunities across different learning areas and activities that are likely to engage and stimulate children's interests. It is now timely to evaluate the quality and use of the indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Children have opportunities to lead their own learning. Teachers incorporate their interests into curriculum planning and the programme in action. Teachers are continuing to develop and refine assessment and planning so individual children's voices and those of parents and whānau are included. Teachers should now review planning for individual learners, and better document the ways they plan to support children's developing ideas and dispositions over time, through play and exploration.</p><p>Centre leaders consult with staff and parents in relation to all management issues, practices and policies, as well as everyday issues. Parents report that this is enriching the sense of belonging that they experience as part of the centre.</p><p>Teachers' bicultural awareness is growing and is now evident at all levels of the centre. Te reo me tikanga Māori are valued and encouraged through the provision of professional development for teachers. Aspects of te reo me tikanga Māori are increasingly included in the programme and staff commitment is evident. Parents affirm the service's positive approach to biculturalism.</p><p>The leadership team is committed to ongoing professional learning, and to building the capability and capacity of individual teachers. To lead this ongoing development, leaders agree that it would be beneficial for them to seek professional development and mentoring as a regular part of their ongoing professional pathway. Teachers' appraisals meet requirements and they could now incorporate deeper professional inquiry into their goal setting to more fully meet the intentions of the Education Council.</p><p>There is good alignment across centre systems, including very good strategic planning and robust policies. A useful next step is for leaders to lead internal evaluation across many aspects of the centre. This will provide a thorough insight to the next steps in centre development and guide ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>refining planning and assessment practices to improve responsiveness to individual children's interests, ideas and dispositions</li>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation to support ongoing improvement</li>
<li>seeking professional development to build leadership and mentoring skills, as part of their ongoing learning and developing role as centre leaders. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Albany Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Albany Community Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>31 August 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
