</table><p>Winton Kindergarten is Very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Winton Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children aged over two years. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 45 children. Children participate in half or whole-day learning programmes running from 8.30am to 2.30pm. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by five qualified and certificated teachers and parent help.</p><p>Winton Kindergarten provides a learning programme that is influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach. There is a strong focus on whanaungatanga, the arts and the natural environment.</p><p>The philosophy of the kindergarten values and nurtures:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all families and their contributions to the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ngƒÅ tamariki and kaiako (teachers) to learn together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Hundred Languages of children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The vision of the kindergarten supports 'the rights of ngƒÅ tamariki to develop strong ecological identities to become the next guardians of kaitiakitanga'.</p><p>Winton Kindergarten is one of 23 kindergartens administered by Kindergartens South (KS). A general manager oversees each kindergarten within the association, under the governance of a board. Senior Teachers provide ongoing professional advice, guidance and support to each kindergarten for teaching and learning.</p><p>The kindergarten has sustained the effective practices noted in ERO's 2013 report. The kindergarten has continued to sustain good progress with curriculum assessment, planning and evaluation practices, teacher appraisal and internal-evaluation systems and practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in KS.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning are consistently promoted and valued. Children are active, deeply engaged learners and are respectful, caring and inclusive of others. Children are supported to be knowledgeable, appreciative and connected to the local environment and wider community. Kaiako help children to develop their ability to negotiate and make informed decisions about their learning.</p><p>Kaiako know the children well and respond appropriately to their strengths, interests and capabilities. They value the positive relationships and interactions shared with children and their families/whƒÅnau. Kaiako model respectful play and support children to develop social skills to relate well to their peers.</p><p>The language, culture and identity of children are valued and reflected in the programme and the curriculum design. The learning environment reflects and expands on the Reggio Emilia approach which is well embedded within the curriculum learning areas. Collaborative relationships between tamariki, whƒÅnau and kaiako are highly evident.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives are integrated in meaningful ways within the learning programme. Kaiako actively work with whƒÅnau MƒÅori to strengthen and consolidate their own learning and understandings of te ao MƒÅori. MƒÅori children's heritage is recognised and promoted within the programme regularly. As a result, MƒÅori children are well supported to experience success as MƒÅori.</p><p>Parents are involved at all levels in the life of the kindergarten. Kaiako keep parents informed of children's learning and progress and happenings in the kindergarten. Kaiako regularly seek the contributions of parents and community expertise to extend and strengthen children's learning pathways.</p><p>Transitions into the kindergarten, within the kindergarten and on to school, are well managed by leaders and kaiako. Kaiako continue to work closely with parents, children and external agencies to support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Individual and group assessment and planning is guided by the kindergarten's philosophy and is documented effectively in the curriculum design. Leaders and kaiako gather the perspectives of children, families and whƒÅnau to inform the learning programme. Parents' and whƒÅnau' aspirations for their children are valued and inform individual children‚Äôs learning goals.</p><p>Leaders promote collaboration amongst kaiako and a culture of distributed leadership. Kaiako benefit from relevant professional development, which supports their teaching practice and enhances their professional capabilities.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2017 reviews of SK kindergartens, there have been significant changes within the association management and leadership team. Many of the good practices in place to support the kindergartens have been sustained. However ERO found that the board needs better information to know how well kindergartens are improving outcomes for children. The board also needs to review its own performance and review the roles and responsibilities within the association leadership and management team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association and board have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps (for SK) to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop the vision, values, philosophy and goals to better reflect the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and te ao MƒÅori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative and show how outcomes for children have been improved, especially for priority learners and in relation to the association‚Äôs valued outcomes, vision and philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure there is a clear process for consulting with all parents and whƒÅnau MƒÅori within the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor the effectiveness of new initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the roles and responsibilities of leadership positions within the association and review the performance and effectiveness of the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and update the complaints policy and procedure.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children at the Winton Kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extend the internal-evaluation process to include regular monitoring of the actions taken and the evaluation of the impact of these on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that these actions are clearly identified in goal setting and the evaluation of progress towards the goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Winton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Winton Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>6 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
