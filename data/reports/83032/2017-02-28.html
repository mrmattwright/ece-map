</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>York Place Preschool and Nursery is a privately owned, inner-city early childhood service. Children from birth-to-school age attend. Many of the children are part time and/or attend on different days each week. The service is deliberate in allowing flexible times. Children come from diverse cultures and some are learning English as a second language.</p><p>Early in 2015, a new owner took over the centre and responsibility for day-to-day administration. A head teacher oversees the staff. Most staff are fully qualified and some are provisionally registered or in training.</p><p>Some of the recommendations in ERO's 2013 report have been addressed. For example, teachers have improved the quality of group planning. Similarly, some aspects of personnel management have been improved. Other areas, such as strategic and annual planning, and the quality of internal evaluation (self review) need further work.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The children are settled and confident in their play and interactions. They play well alongside each other and know the centre routines. Teachers know the children well and are responsive to their individual strengths and interests. ERO observed respectful, nurturing and positive interactions between teachers and children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from calm, affirming and responsive interactions with their teachers. They settle quickly and have a special relationship with their assigned teachers. Teachers are responsive to their non-verbal cues. The regular inclusion of te reo and te ao Māori is a strength in the nursery area. Children's transitions into the nursery and on to the preschool are sensitively managed. </p><p>Teachers are intentional in the way they support children's learning. There is an appropriate balance between adult (provocation) and child-initiated play. Children are encouraged to take responsibility, act as leaders and make choices. They show a sustained interest in their play and enjoy sustained conversations with teachers. Teachers encourage problem solving and experimentation.</p><p>Strengths in the group programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on children's interests and positive dispositions</li>
<li>interesting early mathematics, literacy, art and science experiences</li>
<li>teachers planning engaging, authentic activities to enrich children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Children's individual records show thoughtful planning and assessment of their learning. Teachers seek and respond to parents' aspirations for their child. Most learning stories capture a significant learning moment. Many are linked to a goal and show increasing complexity in a child's learning over time. The next step is to better show how teaching strategies have supported the learning. This applies also to some group planning.</p><p>The new owner has sought appropriate support to build her knowledge and understanding of centre management and early childhood education. She has identified useful strategic priorities and is in the process of developing plans (strategic and annual) to implement these. To ensure ongoing improvement, it is important that other systems and practices align with these priorities and that leaders regularly monitor the centre's progress against its plans.</p><p>Leadership of teaching and learning needs strengthening. This relates to providing guidance, supervision and direction to teachers to continue to grow professionally and to ensure high quality learning for children across the centre. ERO found that aspects of the appraisal process, support for provisionally registered teachers and leadership of professional learning need strengthening. There is potential to better use the strengths of some teachers and grow their leadership skills.</p><p>Aspects of internal evaluation (self review) need further strengthening. Teachers reflect on the impact of their work with children and have undertaken some useful reviews to improve practices. The next step is to develop guidelines for effective internal evaluation and a schedule for this. The schedule should ensure that all aspects of teaching and learning are reviewed over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>professional leadership of and support for staff</li>
<li>alignment to and monitoring of robust annual and strategic plans for centre development and improvement</li>
<li>aspects of planning, assessment and internal evaluation.</li>
<li>Other next steps include:</li>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy so that it clearly states the centre's priorities for children's learning</li>
<li>reviewing how well the learning environment in the preschool area (e.g. range of resources and activities) supports children's learning</li>
<li>developing a useful procedure for appraisal of staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of York Place Preschool &amp; Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of York Place Preschool &amp; Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>28 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
