</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Epuni Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 40 children, aged over two years. Sessions run daily from 8:30am to 2:30 pm. Of the 53 children currently enrolled, ten are MƒÅori and five are of Pacific heritage. The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises promoting children‚Äôs social and emotional competence, self-belief, sense of identity and love of learning.</p><p>Since the September 2015 ERO report, a new head teacher and teaching team have been appointed. They are all fully qualified. A number of new systems and processes have been put in place. At the time of this review, teachers were planning a redevelopment of the outdoor environment.</p><p>Epuni Kindergarten is one of 19 services in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the previous ERO review, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key next steps for this kindergarten that included developing assessment and internal evaluation practices. Suitable progress has been made.</p><p>Practices requiring development were also identified for the association. These included: strategic planning; cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families; evaluation; and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of nine kindergartens in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage confidently in a programme that is highly responsive to their strengths and interests. Teachers facilitate opportunities for children to lead their own learning and see themselves as empowered learners. Meaningful literacy, numeracy and creative arts experiences are embedded in play. Teachers enable authentic opportunities to build oral language. Tuakana teina interactions between older and younger children are well promoted in the mixed-age setting.</p><p>The learning environment is a strength of the kindergarten. Teachers thoughtfully arrange children‚Äôs spaces and provide engaging resources to invite their focused exploration and promote friendships.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori values such as manaakitanga and wairuatanga are evident in daily interactions. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are valued and teachers are committed to building their practice in these areas. Next steps are for them to consult with whƒÅnau MƒÅori to find ways to localise their bicultural practice to the Epuni learning community. This is likely to be supported by the association‚Äôs current strategic focus in this area. Association leaders should also continue to build teachers‚Äô understanding of specific strategies, in partnership with whƒÅnau, that promote the learning success of MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. Teachers purposefully build positive relationships with parents and whƒÅnau, supporting their sense of belonging and celebrating their diverse languages and expertise.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. External agencies are accessed, as appropriate, in consultation with parents.</p><p>A good relationship has been established with adjacent Epuni School. Reciprocal visits occur regularly. A range of useful strategies is in place to support children's and parents‚Äô confidence when transitioning to school.</p><p>Learning portfolios are well used to record children‚Äôs progress, interests, ideas and growing friendships. Teachers acknowledge that assessment, planning and evaluation documentation is an area of ongoing development. They agree that they should make better use of parent aspirations, and children‚Äôs unique interests and cultural contexts, to plan and evaluate teaching strategies. Portfolios should more clearly show how tailored, purposeful practices have resulted in improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The teaching team are reflective and improvement focused. They are supported to grow their internal evaluation practice through useful association systems and tools. Senior teachers should continue to work with teachers to build their capacity to measure the impact of their practice on children‚Äôs learning outcomes.</p><p>Leaders demonstrate a strong commitment to enacting the kindergarten philosophy in practice. The team is collaborative and there are opportunities for teachers to take on leadership roles, according to their strengths and interests. They are engaged practitioners who actively promote the wellbeing and learning of children and their families.¬†</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goal-setting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen teacher development by implementing an inquiry-based approach to appraisal. This should support teachers to better measure the success of improved practices in promoting outcomes for specific children and priority groups.</p><p>The governance board includes community representatives with a wide range of useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work well together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. Equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing are actively sought.¬†</p><p>The association's senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning. Leaders are successfully fostering a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>build culturally responsive assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>strengthen the bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>develop a robust range of strategies to promote the success of MƒÅori and Pacific learners.</li>
</ul><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that they should continue to build their effectiveness by:</p><ul>
<li>measuring the extent to which children's and their families‚Äô outcomes are improved though association initiatives and systems. This should include analysing their impact on specific priority groups</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for whƒÅnau to actively contribute to the association‚Äôs operation and strategic direction.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Epuni Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Epuni Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</p><p>17 October 2018¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
