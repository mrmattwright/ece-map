</table><p>Estuary Road Preschool Limited is in the early stages of developing an effective management framework. The managers and teachers have participated in extensive professional development provided by the Ministry of Education. They have yet to fully use the knowledge gained to put in place systems and practices to promote ongoing improvement for high quality learning and teaching for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Estuary Road Preschool Limited is a privately-owned centre providing care and education for babies, toddlers and children to school age. The centre has stable staffing and most are registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre operates from a converted house located next to the local school. There is a separate nursery and areas for the older children. The centre has a full licence. There are s extensive building renovations to be completed.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2013, a new centre manager has been permanently appointed. The centre has made some progress towards addressing the recommendations from the last ERO report. However, self review, child assessment and planning remain areas for further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two centre reviews owned and administered by the same service provider. The other centre is Templeton Nursery and Preschool.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and busy in the centre environment. They make choices about their play and have many opportunities to develop their ideas and thinking. Children have positive, respectful relationships with their teachers and with each other.</p><p>Teachers support children to be independent and develop their self-help skills. They consistently identify children’s interests in child assessments, and revisit learning. Teachers make positive links between the home and centre and encourage families to contribute information about their children.</p><p>Children’s transition into the centre is well planned and managed. Infants and toddlers experience calm, unhurried routines. They form close relationships with caring, responsive teachers who take time to listen. Teachers provide a nurturing, positive environment for these young children.</p><p>The managers have recently improved operations by aligning the centre policies and procedures to the 2008 Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations. This is ensuring that health and safety requirements are well met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO give high priority to completing the management framework. This was begun with advisory support assistance. Completion and implementation of the framework should ensure the centre is sustainable and the quality of learning and teaching continues to improve.  The managers need to complete:</p><ul>
<li>the philosophy and put it into practice</li>
<li>the strategic plan and monitor progress towards achieving the goals</li>
<li>the new staff appraisal process and to ensure that it meets the practicing teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>The managers and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>embed self-review practices</li>
<li>refine programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>further develop Māori success as Māori, and the inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The managers should also consider ways that the two centres can work more closely together to share good practices and support each other.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Estuary Road Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake. </li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements, the service needs to ensure appropriate documents are developed, maintained and regularly reviewed.<br> <em>[47(1) (c) (i) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Estuary Road Preschool Limited will be within two years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
