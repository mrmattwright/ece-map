</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids on Broadway is one of two full-day education and care centres, operated by a parent management committee and is a chartered incorporated society. It is located in Matamata, and caters for children from two years to school age. It is licensed for 25 children, and currently there are 38 on the roll. The centre has five teachers including the centre manager and four of these are qualified and fully registered.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to promote empathy and compassion for others in a home-like environment where children experience warmth and unity, and have opportunities to be curious and creative.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2015, two subcommittees for each service have been established with one president that oversees both centres. Teachers have focused on improving their practice through ongoing professional development and reflection. The use of te reo MƒÅori and the bicultural curriculum have also been developed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have established respectful, nurturing and caring relationships with children and their families. Positive, respectful interactions are evident between teachers and children. Children are able to lead their own learning and are encouraged to make choices and decisions during prolonged periods of uninterrupted play. Open-ended questions are used to promote children‚Äôs understanding about their learning, in authentic and meaningful contexts. Children are becoming confident and competent learners and explorers.</p><p>Children with additional learning and care needs are well supported with individual development plans and care. Outside agencies are supporting teachers with knowledge and strategies to provide these children with successful learning experiences. This inclusive approach is enabling children to experience a curriculum that is responsive to their interests and preferences. Children are respected for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>The home-like environment is well equipped and thoughtfully designed. Open-ended resources are provided allowing children to make choices about their learning alongside teachers. The outside learning space promotes risk taking and physical challenge. Early mathematics and literacy experiences are meaningfully woven throughout learning. Teachers know children as individuals. Children are encouraged to become socially competent, solve problems, and are trusted as independent learners. Children experience purposeful and meaningful learning opportunities.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are positive and flexible. Readiness for school is supported by responsive transition processes. Children with additional learning needs receive a more personalised approach to support their integration into the school environment. Children‚Äôs portfolios show their engagement in the programme and are readily available for children and parents to revisit their learning. While te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are visible in the centre there is a need to further develop aspects of a bicultural curriculum. Teachers promote unity, kindness and positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The centre manager has effectively established positive and reciprocal relationships with the teaching team. Leadership implements policies and procedures, which support the daily operations of the centre. Self review is well established and is contributing to ongoing improvement. While the teacher appraisal process is developing, there is a need to strengthen the alignment of this process to the expectations of the Education Council. Relevant professional learning and development is also improving teachers' knowledge and capacity. Leaders support teachers to reflect on their practice, to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The management committee provides governance for the centre. Well-established systems and processes are in place to guide daily operations. The annual plan has been developed, and a system for monitoring progress is in place. Governance and management systems are contributing to ongoing improvement and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further improve practice leaders need to review the strategic plan, redevelop priorities and set goals that more clearly contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. This will include strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>the appraisal policy and procedure to align with Education Council of New Zealand requirements and guidelines</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation documentation to ensure it is used to inform the curriculum</li>
<li>planning to support continuity of learning and to promote deeper recognition and analysis of learning</li>
<li>goals to reflect a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The centre should now access professional support for the committee and centre manager to guide the development of a robust, long-term strategic plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids on Broadway completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, the service needs to improve its performance by ensuring the service's curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, whƒÅnau and life context. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2].</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids on Broadway will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>29 June 2018</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
