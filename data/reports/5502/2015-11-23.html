</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children attending Port Chalmers Kindergarten benefit from teachers&rsquo; commitment to fostering positive relationships with their families, and the connections they make to the Port Chalmers community.</p><p>This kindergarten is one of 24 in the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). It is located in Port Chalmers next door to the school. Up to 40 children travel from surrounding areas to attend the daily sessions. Children may attend for some or all of the day. Children come from a diverse range of family backgrounds.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, the outdoor area has continued to be improved and has a variety of interesting places for children to play and challenge themselves. Teachers have been working on the recommendations from this review and these continue to be an ongoing focus. Teachers and children have settled well into the new building. The teaching team has mostly stayed the same.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have fun with their friends as they learn at Port Chalmers Kindergarten. Teachers have created a place where families feel comfortable to spend time with their children as they settle. Teachers are very aware of children needing individual support and extra care in the programme and have created an inclusive environment. Teachers give families ideas to help them support their child&rsquo;s learning at home.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is well supported. Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>arrange the day to allow minimal interruptions to sustained play</li>
<li>respond to children&rsquo;s play ideas and provide resources to extend these</li>
<li>actively support children to develop necessary skills to be friends with one another</li>
<li>use their knowledge of children to respond to them in meaningful ways</li>
<li>encourage older children to take on leadership roles in the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p>The philosophy states that teachers aim for children to be successful learners and communicators and to be curious about the world around them. They plan a programme to meet these aims. Children enjoy a wide variety of interesting experiences suitable for all children in the mixed-age setting. These include:</p><ul>
<li>early literacy</li>
<li>gardening and sustainability</li>
<li>art and creativity.</li>
</ul><p>Children regularly go on trips within the local community, such as to the Orokonui eco-sanctuary and Quarantine Island. These provide a shared platform of experiences for teachers and children to talk about together, and for children to use as play ideas. They also take part in local community events, including an artist-in-residence programme and Matariki celebrations.</p><p>Teachers are committed to deepening the bicultural curriculum and have plans to ensure this is built on and extended. For example, they have introduced a weekly kapa haka session supported by a parent.</p><p>Teachers have useful systems for planning to meet the interests and needs of groups and individual children. Aspects of group and individual planning and evaluation require strengthening to make the desired learning more evident. Children&rsquo;s profile books show many moments of learning. They are accessible to children and enjoyed by them.</p><p>The head teacher leads the vision for the kindergarten. There are systems in place for the smooth operation of the daily programme and practices. Teachers work well together. They have a strong focus on continuing to improve their teaching. A noted strength is the way teachers make positive changes to their practice as a result of professional learning.</p><p>Teachers have a useful format for self review. They have made some positive changes as a result of self review. There is still further work to do for this to be fully effective.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are responsive to the identified needs of children and families within the association, and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, senior teacher and ERO agree the next steps for the kindergarten&rsquo;s ongoing improvement journey are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self-review practices by making more effective use of indicators throughout all stages of the review</li>
<li>ensure the philosophy makes clear what is valued as important learning for children and include their commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
<li>strengthen group planning and evaluation to make clearer the intended learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen children&rsquo;s records to show more clearly how teachers work in partnership with parents to determine the next steps for learning and the strategies to achieve this learning.</li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association&rsquo;s vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent, high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Port Chalmers Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Port Chalmers Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in <a class="ss-broken" href="/review-reports/port-chalmers-kindergarten-23-11-2015/#_General_Information_about">SECTION 3</a> of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices/PART-4-ERO-s-Framework-for-review-Nga-Pou-Here"> Ng&#257; Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h4>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><div>
