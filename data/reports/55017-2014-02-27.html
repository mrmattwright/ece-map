</table><p>Matawai Playcentre is governed by the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association (the association). This evaluation finds there are significant areas requiring development. The current level of support from the association is not sufficient to assist playcentre members to grow their practice to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matawai Playcentre is in the grounds of the local primary school, in the Matawai rural district near Gisborne. The centre operates two mixed-age sessions weekly for a maximum of 30 children, including 15 children up to two years of age. Sessions are fully parent led.</p><p>The centre has had a good reporting history with ERO. However, this 2013 evaluation finds there are significant areas for development in order to improve learning outcomes for children. At the time of this review, playcentre members had changed the structure of roles and responsibilities from office holders to a cooperative.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven playcentre reviews in the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre requires significant support to further improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Many of the policies and procedures informing centre operations are not current. The association should give priority to the review of these policies, procedures and systems so that they support parents&rsquo; practice. Recruiting and sustaining members' commitment on the board has been difficult and this has resulted in many systems and processes not being kept up to date. This review should assist succession planning.</p><p>Children are warmly welcomed into the playcentre. They engage in a play-based programme and freely explore a wide range of curriculum areas. The playcentre is well resourced and children choose from a wide range of easily accessible resources. They play alongside one another and collaboratively. Adults are positive and caring towards children and respect their play. The tone of sessions is busy and settled.</p><p>Excursions into the community and visitors into the playcentre offer extension to the programme. Routines are consistently implemented throughout the day, giving children a sense of security in being able to predict what will happen next.</p><p>Adults work alongside children and engage them in conversations. A next step for strengthening the learning programme is to encourage parents to use interactions that are more purposeful and focused on learning.</p><p>At times adults use te reo M&#257;ori and integrate appropriate aspects of tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori. This practice, and the ongoing promotion of a bicultural curriculum, should be developed further and include a commitment by all parents involved in the playcentre. Members should also formally investigate what success for M&#257;ori children, as M&#257;ori might look like at Matawai Playcentre.</p><p>Planning is theme based and led by adults. This is not reflective of the stated philosophy which indicates that &lsquo;learning focuses on individual child interests and group/age interests&rsquo;. The programme is not regularly evaluated. Portfolios are a record of participation in activities offered. Members should seek support to develop their knowledge of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s transition to primary school is well facilitated by the centre&rsquo;s location in school grounds. There is a close relationship with the new entrant teacher, and playcentre members regularly participate in combined events with the school.</p><p>Members regularly reflect on the resourcing of curriculum areas. Evidence-based self review is not an established practice and requires development. Playcentre members should seek guidance in building their understanding of how self review can be used to improve the quality of programmes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends that members develop and improve:</p><ul>
<li>understandings of assessment, planning and evaluation based on children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>evidence-based self review to improve decision making</li>
<li>interactions that are more purposeful and focused on learning</li>
<li>the integrated use of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori by all members</li>
<li>the provision of opportunities for M&#257;ori children to enjoy success as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matawai Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must:</p><ol>
<li>police vet those who are required to be</li>
<li>hold a current annual building warrant of fitness</li>
<li>develop and maintain appropriate documentation and records which are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>ensure the service is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ol><p><em>Education Act 1989, s319D&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: PF3 (2), GMA 6 (1), and C2</em></p><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, governance and management must:</p><ol>
<li>ensure the service is effectively governed and is managed in accordance with good management practices</li>
<li>develop a process for reviewing and evaluating the service's operations.</li>
</ol><p><em>Education (Early childhood services) Regulations 2008: R47, 1 (a) and (c)</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Matawai Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
