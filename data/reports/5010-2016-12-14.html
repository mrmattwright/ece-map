</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Forest View Kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA) which provides a governance and management framework to support its operation. Children from the surrounding suburbs and from further afield attend morning or all day sessions in a mixed age group. The kindergarten is able to cater for up to 40 children over the age of two years. Children play together in a mixed age group. The majority of children have MƒÅori heritage. The kindergarten has a staff of five qualified teachers.</p><p>The philosophy for the kindergarten clearly indicates a commitment to fostering children's understanding and knowledge of New Zealand's dual cultural heritage. This focus includes the use of te reo MƒÅori and tikanga practices as part of the learning programme.</p><p>ERO's 2012 review recommended developments in self review as well as planning, assessment and evaluation. These areas continue to be the focus of development.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten at the start of the day. They settle quickly to play, making choices from the wide range of activities and resources available. Teachers encourage children to be independent and to guide their own learning in the carefully prepared environment.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate genuine attitudes of respect and willingness to listen to whƒÅnau. Parents spoken to during the review expressed their appreciation of the kindergarten. Teachers have developed positive, sensitive relationships with children. They respect the children's right to express a point of view and have meaningful conversations with children.</p><p>Teachers promote children's self-choice and encourage them to take increasing responsibility for their own wellbeing and the wellbeing of others. There are good prompts in the environment for children to engage with print, to enjoy stories and to act out familiar stories. Children are also able to learn about mathematical concepts and the natural world. There are good opportunities for children to be imaginative and creative.</p><p>Assessment processes are well established. Children's portfolios are cherished by whƒÅnau and children, and provide a good pictorial story of the children's learning journeys. Some of the written stories are high quality and clearly demonstrate children's dispositions and personalities. This focus on recording children's time in the centre is also clear in the "Learning and Growing Together - Ako tahi tupu ana" large books on display around the centre. These records are clearly linked to the MƒÅori values and tikanga that teachers identify in children's play.</p><p>Teachers have evaluated and reviewed the bicultural focus in the centre. The indoor environment demonstrates the progress they are making in showing their commitment to making bicultural intentions clear. Teachers support the deliberate use of te reo MƒÅori with children and in written displays. This continues to be an area that all teachers wish to further develop.</p><p>The Association provides governance for kindergartens. Its long-term direction continues to focus on improving learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>very good support and guidance by Association personnel in an organisational culture that supports ongoing improvement particularly in the development of culturally responsive practices that are meaningful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new and effective teacher appraisal systems, and professional learning and development that focuses more closely on whole team participation to improve skills, knowledge and practice, particularly in more shared leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a continuing focus and investment in property and environment upgrades to promote children's exploration and investigation</p>
</li>
<li>regular head teacher meetings that provide of collegial discussion and support.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Association managers and teachers agree that next key steps for teachers is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more explicitly record and evaluate the teachers' role in supporting children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build capacity across the teaching team to increase consistency in assessment and teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Forest View Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, the Association should ensure that all kindergarten policy folders include updated policies and procedures that reflect the latest legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Forest View Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
