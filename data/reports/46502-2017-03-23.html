</table><p>The centre owner and teachers have established an inclusive multi-cultural environment that responds to the diverse nationalities of families. Relationships with children, families and amongst staff are affirming, respectful and supportive.</p><p>Sunny Side Educare would now benefit from external support to strengthen significant aspects of governance and management, professional leadership and curriculum implementation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunny Side Early Educare is a privately owned full-day early childhood service located in a redeveloped premises close to Waikato Hospital. The centre was opened in 2014 and received a full licence in early 2016. It is licensed for 42 children, including 12 children under the age of two. At the time of this ERO review there were 49 children on the roll. A feature of the roll is the number of different nationalities of families attending.</p><p>The centre operates in an attractive, home-like setting with two separate, age-based areas. The centre owner is also the manager with responsibility for centre governance. The head teacher shares responsibility for day-to-day organisation. There is a commitment to employing qualified teachers. The centre philosophy aims to provide a safe, secure and stimulating environment where children can develop physically, emotionally, socially and intellectually in a holistic way. It makes a commitment to respecting the individual nationalities of children and their families, and responding to their aims and aspirations.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a programme that is predominately teacher-led with opportunities for child-initiated play through the day. Teachers plan and prepare the environment to give children a choice from pre-selected, good quality equipment and materials. There are opportunities for children to play and participate in a morning mat time as a mixed-age group, which is promoting their belonging and wellbeing. Older children demonstrate high levels of consideration and support for younger siblings during these times. The curriculum requires further development to provide children with improved access to a wider range of equipment, materials and experiences that add challenge, engage and extend active learners, particularly for boys.</p><p>Literacy learning is fostered through children's access to an appropriate range of writing materials, sharing reading with teachers, and learning songs and finger plays. Older children engage in dramatic and role playing together. Children are encouraged to express their creativity through experiences of different media. These contributions are well displayed in the centre. Teachers plan regular trips and excursions into the local and wider community, and invite the participation of families. Children are building their social skills, expressing themselves creatively, and learning about the wider world.</p><p>A particular strength of the centre is the priority placed on acknowledging and affirming the many cultures, nationalities and languages of children and their families. Many families benefit from being able to communicate in their own language with the centre owner and staff. Cultural celebrations such as Diwali are a regular part of the centre programme. This is providing children with many experiences to enrich their understanding and respect for other cultures.</p><p>There is an ongoing commitment to including aspects of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori in the daily programme. Children's pepeha are displayed, they share karakia before meals, learn waiata and enjoy growing and sharing food from centre gardens. Matariki is celebrated each year. Children are learning about bicultural New Zealand. Children would benefit from further, regular opportunities to learn about the stories and visit the places of local significance to MƒÅori.</p><p>Toddlers are confident and settled. They benefit from a home-like setting with two dedicated teachers. They are able to actively explore in an interesting and safe environment. Parents spoken to by ERO appreciated the regular communication with teachers that promotes consistency of care and routines between home and the centre. ERO observed babies receiving nurture from teachers and experiencing calm and unhurried care. Teachers need to ensure they quickly provide soothing and comfort for babies who show signs of stress.</p><p>Children's learning and development are recorded in attractive portfolios, accessible to families. There are good examples of teachers recording learning stories where children's interests were recognised and responded to over time. Attractive centre displays make learning visible for families. Children would benefit from a more planned approach to sharing portfolios with families, teachers and their peers. Teachers should continue to explore ways to further engage families in developing goals and sharing their aspirations for children.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are well planned with good information and support for children and their families. Children under two years benefit from shared learning spaces that supports their transition into the older children's area. Older children move on to many different schools and parents take responsibility to manage these transitions. Teachers are planning to strengthen the relationships and information sharing between schools and the centre.</p><p>The centre owner and head teacher have undertaken a variety of roles as qualified early childhood teachers. They have a long-established, professional and respectful relationship. In a relatively short time, centre leaders, teachers and staff have developed a positive and cooperative teaching team. It is important to more clearly define the roles and responsibilities for all staff. This is likely to strengthen day-to-day organisation and improve outcomes for children and families.</p><p>The teaching team meet regularly to discuss organisational matters for the running of the centre. Consideration should be given to allocating specific time for professional discussion and sharing amongst the teaching team. Teachers would benefit from having more adequate and professional spaces for planning and withdrawal from children. In addition, teachers need to develop a shared and agreed understanding of best practice in the early childhood setting, and receive regular feedback from centre leaders and peers about their practice in relation to these criteria.</p><p>Recent self review, undertaken with the support of an external provider, has focused on positively guiding children's behaviour and transitions. This has resulted in a more consistent approach and a calm and settled atmosphere within the centre. There is a need to develop a strategic approach to self review to ensure the centre is meeting Ministry of Education regulatory requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Important next steps are for the service provider to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the centre manager, head teacher and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement robust systems and processes for effective appraisal, attestation and the induction and mentoring of provisionally registered teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teacher capability by developing and implementing clear expectations for effective teaching practices that support positive learning outcomes for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement effective self-review processes to strategically guide centre development and improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is likely to promote ongoing centre sustainability, support the service to meet legislative requirements, and contribute to achieving the aims of the Sunny Side Educare philosophy.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunny Side Early Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ol>
<li>Implementing an ongoing process of self review.</li>
<li>Ensuring that effective human resource management policies and practices are implemented. This must include:<br>
<ul>
<li>a system of regular appraisal, including the appraisal of the centre manager</li>
<li>an effective induction and mentoring programme for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>attestation for the issue and renewal of practicing teaching certificates</li>
<li>processes for building teacher capability by developing and implementing expectations for teaching that link to current theory and practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="display: inline !important;">Increasing the range of experiences and opportunities to enhance learning, particularly for older children.</li>
<li>Providing a sufficient quantity and variety of equipment and materials appropriate for the learning needs of older children.</li>
<li style="display: inline !important;">Ensuring the sun safety policy is effectively implemented.</li>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
