</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kid's Cove Learning Centre Newmarket operates on the first floor of a commercial building and has a roof-top outdoor area for children's play. There are three interior learning areas for the different age groups. The centre is licensed for 70 children including up to 20 under two years of age. The centre offers full-time education and care and a cook prepares meals on site. Families come from a culturally and socially diverse community.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on nurturing children's identities as resourceful, resilient, reflective and responsive learners. Reggio Emilia approaches, the RIE philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, guide teacher practices and programme implementation.</p><p>The centre has maintained positive aspects noted in the ERO 2013 report, including a welcoming and inclusive culture. Since the 2013 review there have been many changes in centre leaders and staffing. A new centre manager and a pedagogical leader were appointed in 2016. Teachers have been engaged in professional development to improve assessment and planning processes. There have been significant improvements to the learning environment, and the concept of primary caregiving has been introduced.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, independent explorers and engaged learners. They show imagination and curiosity, capably engaging in cooperative play for sustained periods of time. Children make discoveries in a calm, aesthetically pleasing environment that promotes investigation. They have fun as they learn through play. Children engage in activities that interest them and happily share ideas with peers and adults. They move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments and show a strong sense of ownership of and belonging in the centre.</p><p>Teachers understand the special characteristics of infants and toddlers, and have a strong belief in their capability. They maintain a calm nurturing environment for infants and toddlers who benefit from individualised nurturing and respectful care. Teachers respond well to toddlers’ and ensure they have space, time and many opportunities to explore, play and try new things at an unhurried pace.</p><p>Teachers skilfully support and encourage children in their learning and provide a range of learning experiences to extend the complexity of their play. They implement a child-led programme that arises from children's interests and patterns of behaviour, the centre's philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The Reggio Emilia concept of the environment as the third teacher, is inspiring child-initiated learning. Vibrant and interesting displays show children engaged in learning and clear connections between assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Assessment portfolios provide very good information about individual children’s involvement in the programme. Centre leaders are keen to enhance aspects of individual planning for children. An online digital programme allows families to access information about their children's daily learning and care. Parents are accessing this information, providing positive feedback and contributing to planning for their children.</p><p>Respectful relationships underpin the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere in the centre. Teachers know children and their families well. Children’s emotional and physical wellbeing is nurtured through positive interactions, respectful relationships and child-focused routines.</p><p>Teachers encourage children who speak another language at home to use their first language. Biculturalism is fostered through meaningful opportunities for children to become familiar with te reo and tikanga Māori. Teachers recognise the importance of continuing to strengthen their bicultural practice through further integrating te ao Maori throughout the programme<em>.</em></p><p>There are comprehensive policies and procedures to guide good health and safety practices. Transitions into and through the centre are well managed. Building stronger links between the centre and schools is a future focus for centre leaders.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively as a team. They have good opportunities for leadership, to attend professional development and share their strengths. A robust appraisal process supports teachers to improve their professional capabilities. Centre leaders are keen to continue building a culture of teachers reflecting on their practice.</p><p>There are well established governance and management practices and the shared philosophy guides centre operations. Centre leaders are proactive and improvement focused, with high expectations of positive outcomes for children. Internal evaluation is well established and informs decisions to enhance programmes provided for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a centre vision to support more educationally focused strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a more collaborative and evaluative internal evaluation process that contributes to centre planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating how effectively teaching strategies and practices respond to children's cultural identities and home languages.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kid's Cove Learning Centre Newmarket completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kid's Cove Learning Centre Newmarket will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>15 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
