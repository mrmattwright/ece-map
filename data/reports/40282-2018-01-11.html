</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bizzy Buddyz Ltd provides home-based education and care for children from birth to school age in educarers' homes. The service is privately owned and operates three networks in Whakatane covering the Eastern Bay of Plenty. Bizzy Buddyz Ltd network operates on a standard licence within which each educarer does not yet have a home-based training qualification. The network is supported by a team of qualified visiting teachers and centralised management and administration.</p><p>The network is licensed for a maximum of 80 children. Each educarer may have a maximum of four children at any one time, including two under the age of two years. Currently the roll consists of 64 children which includes 50 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The service's philosophy is to provide a safe, secure and stimulating environment to promote children's learning in which they feel nurtured and experience a sense of belonging. Educarers are supported and provided with opportunities for professional development. Respectful relationships with educarers and whƒÅnau are promoted through open communication.</p><p>The owner/managing director retains overall responsibility for governance including strategic direction, the policy framework to meet legislative requirements, financial and personnel management.</p><p>While the 2014 ERO report recommended the service management access external guidance and development to strengthen professional leadership in self review and staff appraisal practices, this has not occurred. There has been improvement to self-review practices, and monitoring of health and safety procedures. However, appraisals for visiting teachers and other aspects of quality assurance remain areas for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are made to feel welcome. At enrolment whƒÅnau are provided with useful information to support their role in choosing an appropriate educarer for them and their children. Children's sense of wellbeing is fostered by educarers who develop close and trusting relationships with them and their families.</p><p>The rhythms and routines of children up to the age of two years are respectfully followed. Inclusive and affirming interactions are promoted by educarers in calm and secure environments. The very young benefit from the ongoing presence and example set by older children. Those who have diverse learning needs are well provided for through services and outside agencies.</p><p>A feature is the recognition and valuing of te ao MƒÅori at the heart of the service. WhƒÅnau aspirations to have their children learn within a culturally responsive context is strongly supported. MƒÅori children continue to have their cultural identity affirmed and celebrated through participation in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori within whƒÅnau home environments. Consideration could be given to reviewing the current philosophy and other guiding documents to more strongly reflect this service's commitment to te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum that is thoughtfully planned and enriched by community events and trips. Educarers provide children with many opportunities for authentic and purposeful learning through play in familiar and home-like environments. Educarers, with the support of visiting teachers, make effective use of the wider community as a resource for learning. This support includes weekly playgroups, visits to the library, gymnastics, music and movement groups, beach, mƒÅrae and local parks. Children are gaining confidence and social competence through participation in the curriculum.</p><p>Educarers and visiting teachers prepare well illustrated portfolios that record children‚Äôs engagement in the programme. These portfolios are available in both hard copy and digital format. They include anecdotal observations, art work and references to the strands and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and relevant information about each child‚Äôs cultural identity and family background.</p><p>Service leaders are providing educarers and whƒÅnau with regular opportunities for relevant professional and personal development. Visiting teachers access externally facilitated professional learning to strengthen their capacity to support educarers through workshops and regular visits. Systematic self review is leading to better informed decision making focused on improvements to the service. Responsive service leadership is building trusting and productive relationships with educarers.</p><p>Leadership of teaching and learning in order to establish a shared understanding and expectations for programme planning, resourcing and evaluation is an essential area for further development. There is a need for the service to review its current transition-to-school programme to ensure it reflects best practice about learning through play in authentic contexts. There is also a need to review the provision of playgroup resources. Literacy, including art, music/movement and dramatic play are well-supported. However, there was limited evidence of the use of natural resources, construction and opportunities for risk and challenge in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>The owner/managing director has successfully established and maintained mutually supportive relationships with the staff, whƒÅnau and the community. She provides an inclusive and caring culture focused on the wellbeing of others. The owner/managing director recognises the urgent need to appoint an appropriately experienced and qualified leader of teaching and learning. This appointee will support the owner to ensure teacher appraisal processes meet the legislative requirements and further strengthen quality assurance processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the professional leadership of teaching and learning needs urgent review and strengthening. This is necessary to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop clear processes for the appraisal of visiting teachers that meet the legislation requirements of Education Council New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure a more consistent approach to quality assurance, including visiting teachers' practice and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance planning, assessment and evaluation practices that focus on dispositional learning pathways and developmentally appropriate literacy and mathematical learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service provides an action plan to be monitored by ERO, to address the issues identified in the compliance and key next steps section of the report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bizzy Buddyz Ltd completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management policies and procedures. To meet requirements the service needs to improve in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update current policies and procedures to align to current regulatory requirements, including appraisal for visiting teacher that supports teacher registration</p>
</li>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
