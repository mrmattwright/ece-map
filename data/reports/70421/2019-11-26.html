</table><p>North Haven Child Care &amp; Education Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>North Haven Childcare and Education Centre is a community-based education and care service. It is licensed for 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Children are cared for, play and learn in two areas, each with its own outdoor area.</p><p>The service is governed by a committee, and is part of the Aoraki Community Education Trust Board.</p><p>A head teacher oversees the day-to day operation of the service and the curriculum, teaching and learning for the children over two years. A deputy head teacher has the responsibility for education and care for children under two.</p><p>The service's philosophy includes its vision and priorities for children's learning. These priorities are for children who are: competent and confident life-long learners; empowered, active, curious and creative; who feel a sense of connectedness |whanaungatanga; and who develop a sense of wellbeing for themselves and others |manaakitanga.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO report, a new head teacher has been appointed. The centre has made very good progress in all of the areas identified in the key next steps in this report. These areas included developing and strengthening: the centre's philosophy, assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning, internal evaluation, appraisal, strategic and annual planning and bicultural programmes and practices.</p><p>The centre is a member of the South Timaru KƒÅhui Ako |Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's collaboratively developed philosophy effectively guides decision making about children's learning and is evident in practice. Children's learning is well supported by the responsive curriculum, linked to the priorities for children's learning. Children benefit from intentional teaching strategies and opportunities to play freely and make choices about their learning. The centre's spacious environments support children to have many opportunities for exploratory and creative play. They are empowered to lead their learning as capable young individuals.</p><p>Teachers effectively assess and plan for children's learning. Teachers carefully plan to meet the learning requirements of children with additional needs and closely monitor their progress. They regularly evaluate all children's progress against their intended learning goals. This enables teachers to be able to evaluate the impact their teaching has had on children's learning.</p><p>Infants' and toddlers' learning and wellbeing is well supported. Teachers know these children and their needs well and attend to their individual needs. Children benefit from the high quality of teachers' interactions with them. Their environment is arranged to empower them as developing learners. They can therefore access experiences that support their growing independence. Infants' and toddlers' caregivers and parents receive useful information about their children's care and learning.</p><p>Children and their families' language, identity and culture are valued, celebrated and supported. There are effective reciprocal relationships between teachers and children's families which enhance children's learning and wellbeing. Teachers and leaders have strengthened their knowledge, understanding and practices with respect to te ao MƒÅori. This is enabling children to experience a more bicultural programme.</p><p>The head teacher, in collaboration with the deputy head teacher and other teachers, has provided effective leadership and managed change for improvement well. There has been a carefully considered, strategic, responsive approach to centre-wide improvement. What matters most for children and adults has been prioritised. External support and targeted professional learning and development has been well used to manage development and change. Embedding and evaluating the effectiveness of these changes will be an important focus going forward. There is a positive culture for teaching, learning and wellbeing for all at the centre.</p><p>The head teacher has ensured that there is good alignment between the philosophy, appraisal and long and short-term planning. This planning is well monitored and usefully guides operations and developments.</p><p>Leaders are making good use of internal-evaluation systems and practices to bring about improvement. There is now an effective, consistent appraisal process in place to support building teachers' capability and the collective capacity of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The governing committee, leaders and teachers should continue to embed and evaluate the sound systems and practices already put in place. This should include ensuring consistent use of the assessment, planning and evaluation practices/procedures used for children's learning.</p><p>It would be timely for leaders and teachers to extend internal evaluation to evaluate how well the centre is achieving its valued priorities for children's learning. This will enable the governance committee and parents to know how well the centre's intended outcomes for children are being met.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of North Haven Child Care &amp; Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>26 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
