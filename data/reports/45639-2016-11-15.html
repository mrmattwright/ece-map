</table><p>Marshlands Nest is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Marshlands Nest is one of four early childhood centres which is part of a franchise called Nest NZ. It is a small privately-owned centre, situated in a converted house.</p><p>The centres philosophy has a focus on providing nurturing interactions and environmentally sustainable teaching practices (NEST). It provides education and care for infants, toddlers and preschool children in a mixed-aged setting.</p><p>All staff are qualified early childhood education teachers. Most are fulltime and one who is part time is also a specialist sports trainer.</p><p>The centre is part of a local learning cluster.</p><p>The recommendations from the 2013 ERO report have been well met. This includes introducing a new appraisal system, a more coherent self review process and developing better links between assessment and planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide children and their families with a welcoming environment. The positive relationships between teachers and children, and parents supports children's wellbeing and sense of belonging.</p><p>Children are actively engaged in a calm settled environment. They learn through play as individuals and in groups to help develop their curiosity, confidence and leadership. Children have respect for each other and their teachers. Older children support younger children (tuakana teina).</p><p>Teachers have considered a number of useful ways to incorporate bicultural practices into the programme. Children experience an increasing focus on te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers work well together to foster children’s learning. They work effectively with and alongside children to engage them in conversation to help extend their thinking. They offer children a range of activities to support literacy and mathematics learning.</p><p>Under two year old children experience respectful relationships and calm routines with their key teacher. They have access to a wide range of activities within the learning environment.</p><p>A number of aspects of the philosophy are evident in practice. For example, natural resources are incorporated into aspects of the learning through environmental programmes.</p><p>Children are well supported by a key teacher who regularly develops individual learning plans to meet each child's goals. Teachers take time to talk with parents about their children’s interests, strengths and abilities. Together they develop shared goals that focus on children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are becoming more reflective about their teaching practices. They are involved in a range of professional development related to their own personal goals and the centre-wide focus.</p><p>Transition into the centre is flexible. To assist transition from the centre children visit schools using the centres transport. They also visit local recreational facilities. These excursions give children many opportunities to enrich their learning.</p><p>Leaders have developed and implemented good systems to support centre operations. Self review is systematic, linked to the centre strategic plan and a regular focus in staff meetings. Self review would be further strengthened by taking a more evaluative approach.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers have agreed that their next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the review process for the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining the strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening child assessment, programme planning, and evaluation of teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practices and use of te reo Māori in the learning programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedding the current appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Marshlands Nest completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Marshlands Nest will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu Southern</p><p>15 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
