</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kerikeri Playcentre operates four parent-led, morning sessions per week. It is licensed for 30 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Children of all ages play together throughout the centre with shared access to all indoor and outdoor play spaces.</p><p>The playcentre is part of the Mid Northland Playcentre Association which provides parent education programmes and an administration framework to guide the operation of the centre.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy of parents as the first and best educators of their children guides centre members. All members contribute to the running of the centre and play alongside children to support their learning and development.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report highlighted the playcentre‚Äôs areas of strengths as leadership and management, children‚Äôs strong sense of wellbeing, and programme planning and evaluation. These strengths have been maintained. Areas for development were the review of centre routines, the engagement of some groups of children and the promotion of literacy learning. Centre members have responded very positively to these recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display a strong sense of belonging and ownership in the centre. The spacious, well resourced layout offers a wide range of play areas for children to settle into. Opportunities exist for them to form mixed-age relationships while being cared for by responsive adults.</p><p>Children are confident communicators. High adult to child ratios provide numerous opportunities for children to engage adults in conversations. In order to make the most of these opportunities, adults should now consider how they could extend children‚Äôs thinking and bring more complexity to children‚Äôs play through skilful questioning.</p><p>Adults plan and initiate a programme that caters for all age groups. Programme plans are informed by observation of children‚Äôs interests, discussion and evaluation. Children‚Äôs portfolios are individual and contain useful information about what they are learning. Adults are assigned a small number of children for whom they need to complete learning stories, which invites different perspectives on each child‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy is very evident in practice and well promoted amongst centre members. Inclusive practices have allowed families from overseas on short term work contracts, and even extended holiday, to participate in the programme. This has added to the cultural diversity of the centre.</p><p>Waiata and te reo MƒÅori are being incorporated into each session and significant cultural events are celebrated. The association‚Äôs Te Waewaekoukou representative supports centre members to liaise with MƒÅori families. Centre leaders have identified a need to evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies and initiatives in ensuring the success of their MƒÅori children. They have recognised the need to strengthen bi-cultural practices.</p><p>Two years of extensive professional development (PD) in self review has resulted in a comprehensive process being established. Centre leaders are confident and capable to continue this process independently. Significant and strategic reviews conducted during this PD have resulted in positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Current playcentre office holders provide consistency and foster sustainable leadership. They encourage and support fellow members to complete training levels. Strong leadership has allowed the centre to survive the rise and fall of roll numbers over recent years. Support networks are being established and good use made of external facilitators.</p><p>The Mid Northland Playcentre Association provides policies and procedures that guide centre practices. Review of these documents occurs at centre level. Stronger support from the association and clarification of responsibilities within the policy framework, would better guide centre practice. Strategic planning processes could be strengthened by clearly defining long term goals and short term actions.</p><p>Discussions between centre members and ERO on the topic of privacy and confidentiality revealed that there is no privacy officer appointed at centre level. Members were unsure whether the association has someone in this role. It is ERO‚Äôs suggestion that an appointment be made and relevant training offered in order to ensure continued privacy and confidentiality of information.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members agree that to enhance outcomes for children they could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to focus on developing children‚Äôs complex play and learning through the use of open ended questions</li>
<li>continue to strengthen programme planning and evaluation processes to focus more on how well children are learning</li>
<li>review long term and annual planning processes</li>
<li>ensure risk assessment management is carried out prior to all trips and excursions</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kerikeri Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The centre is aware of the need to Police vet all employees.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kerikeri Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
