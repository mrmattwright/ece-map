<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">St Albans Playcentre is one of 49 operating playcentres that are administrated by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is open for five sessions each week.</p><p align="left">The playcentre operates as a parent cooperative. All parents take responsibility and share leadership for the day to day operation of the playcentre. The association offers opportunities for parents to train in Playcentre&rsquo;s early childhood education training programme.</p><p align="left">The centre experienced minimal damage and disruption as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p><p align="left">Coordinators and parents provide a warm, caring and supportive environment for adults and children. The centre is well established, spacious and well resourced.</p><p align="left">The programme strongly reflects Playcentre philosophy. There were high levels of parent participation at the time of the review.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>a child-led curriculum where children are supported to follow their interests and make choices about their own learning</li>
<li>parents actively sharing supervision and interacting with children</li>
<li>the promotion of parent education</li>
<li>ongoing focus to improve the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>providing opportunities for children of other cultures to use their first language.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Parents are aware of the need to extend assessment practices to make sure children&rsquo;s learning is clearly identified so they can better support next learning steps.</p><p align="left">Parents have improved self-review processes since the last ERO review.</p><p align="left">The next steps are to make better use of daily reflections in self review, and to focus more on centre experiences that directly promote children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of St Albans Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSt Albans Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The playcentre&rsquo;s mission and vision strongly focus on empowering children and families through supportive and caring relationships. Parents are recognised as children&rsquo;s first educators. The curriculum document, Te Wh&#257;riki, New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum is the basis for the programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The child-led programme provides children with many opportunities to make choices, and to follow and develop their own interests. Children have a wide range of activities available to them, both inside and outside. They are asked to help parents set up the activities they are most interested in. Parents actively involve themselves in play and foster children&rsquo;s independence and self-help skills. Literacy is a feature across the programme. Children are familiar with expectations and routines. Parents make sure the programme is flexible so children&rsquo;s interests can be adequately followed and met. This results in sustained interactions and activities.</p><p align="left">Profile books provide children and parents with a useful record of their participation. Children&rsquo;s activities and achievements are attractively recorded through photos and written descriptions. Children have access to their profiles and often read them with their parents.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from warm, caring and supportive relationships. Parents know each other&rsquo;s children well. They respond to children&rsquo;s interests and play, and help them to settle and sustain activities. Adults interact well together providing appropriate role models for children.</p><p align="left">Parents support the development of children&rsquo;s social skills through cooperative play and sharing. Children are given good opportunities to extend their oral language. First language use is encouraged for children from other cultures. Some parents are using questioning skills effectively to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning. Children&rsquo;s efforts and achievements are well recognised and affirmed.</p><p align="left">The environment provides children with a wide range of opportunities to explore and develop their interests. The centre is spacious and well planned, both indoors and outdoors. There is a wide range of resources that stimulate children&rsquo;s interests and support their play and development. Wall displays are attractive. They feature children&rsquo;s work and provide information to parents about the programme, parent education and their children&rsquo;s participation in activities.</p><p align="left">Since the last review, parents have made good progress in establishing a self-review process. This includes daily reflections about the programme and children&rsquo;s participation that parents share at the end of the session. Parents are also formally reviewing some aspects of the programme.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">ERO supports centre coordinators who have identified the need to extend assessment and programme planning. The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>clearly identify the children&rsquo;s learning within assessment records and the next steps that parents can take to extend learning</li>
<li>more clearly show how children&rsquo;s learning progresses over time</li>
<li>make better use of children&rsquo;s assessment information when planning the programme for individuals and groups.</li>
<li>In discussion with ERO, the current group of parents acknowledge the next steps in self review are to:</li>
<li>make better use of their daily informal reflections within centre self review</li>
<li>extend the self-review programme to focus more on learning outcomes for children and how adults can better support their children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of St Albans Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The playcentre is open for five sessions each week.</p><p align="left">The playcentre operates as a parent cooperative. All parents take responsibility and share leadership for the day to day operation of the playcentre. The association offers opportunities for parents to train in Playcentre&rsquo;s early childhood education training programme.</p><p align="left">The centre experienced minimal damage and disruption as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p><p align="left">Coordinators and parents provide a warm, caring and supportive environment for adults and children. The centre is well established, spacious and well resourced.</p><p align="left">The programme strongly reflects Playcentre philosophy. There were high levels of parent participation at the time of the review.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>a child-led curriculum where children are supported to follow their interests and make choices about their own learning</li>
<li>parents actively sharing supervision and interacting with children</li>
<li>the promotion of parent education</li>
<li>ongoing focus to improve the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>providing opportunities for children of other cultures to use their first language.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Parents are aware of the need to extend assessment practices to make sure children&rsquo;s learning is clearly identified so they can better support next learning steps.</p><p align="left">Parents have improved self-review processes since the last ERO review.</p><p align="left">The next steps are to make better use of daily reflections in self review, and to focus more on centre experiences that directly promote children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
