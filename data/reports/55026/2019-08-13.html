</table><p>Nuhaka Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nuhaka Playcentre is located on the grounds of Nuhaka School. The centre provides one session weekly for 18 children, including eight up to the age of two. At the time of this review, there were 14 children enrolled.</p><p>The centre is administered by Playcentre Aotearoa, Central North Island Region and is supported by a regional manager. National policies are in the process of being developed and distributed to playcentres for implementation.</p><p>The¬†Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together', is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. Alongside this, the centre values promote individuality and well-being.</p><p>WhƒÅnau and families are valued as the primary educators of their children and share responsibility for the curriculum. Day-to-day operation is undertaken by session support personnel and centre-elected office holders. This playcentre currently does not have access to a centre support worker who regularly visits to provide professional guidance and support, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five playcentres in the TairƒÅwhiti area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning within a curriculum that reflects their interests well. A range of resources are freely accessed and there are many opportunities to revisit learning. Infants and toddlers are well cared for by attentive adults. Tuakana teina learning supports these children to develop their knowledge and skills. Children play confidently with and alongside each other.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is developing. Parents use of te reo MƒÅori is strengthening and tikanga MƒÅori evident within routines. Centre members have identified ways to further promote the bicultural programme. This should include seeking ways to promote connections to areas of local significance.</p><p>The Playcentre value of 'parents as first and best educators' supports whƒÅnau MƒÅori to define what educational success looks like for their children. As the roopu and regional structure rebuilds in the area all parents should seek ways to develop their understanding of kaupapa MƒÅori approaches to teaching and learning to foster this.</p><p>Parents work together to grow knowledge amongst members and promote positive outcomes for children. They communicate well with each other to respond to the individual needs of children. Adults give children choices within their play and respect their decisions. Children display independence and a sense of belonging.</p><p>Recent involvement in Playcentre education courses has impacted positively on assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. Group planning promotes responsiveness to children's interests and developmental stages. Most assessment clearly identifies learning, developing skills and some progress over time. A next step is to implement individual planning that responds to clearly identified learning goals, and to build contributions from all centre members to each child's assessment.</p><p>Parents are reflective about current practices and identify areas for improvement through regular review. Internal evaluation is building and is increasingly focused on outcomes for children. Centre members should continue to strengthen this process by identifying what high quality practice looks like in relation to the topic and in line with Playcentre philosophy. These indicators can then be used to guide decision making and evaluate how effective changes have been in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Playcentre‚Äôs national restructuring process has significantly hindered the support and professional development provided to centre members. Regional personnel are in the early stages of rebuilding collaboration and support networks. National systems and processes are yet to be consistently implemented. There is a recent focus on building relational trust and a responsive parent education system to establish more effective operations. A key next step is for regional managers to ensure that expected levels of support occur for each centre.</p><p>The appraisal process is currently based on annual review of successes and challenges. This requires further strengthening to better reflect roles and responsibilities, building of capability and evaluation of performance aligned to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural curriculum to make meaningful connections for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop individual planning and assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grow understanding and use of internal evaluation to promote improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level (Playcentre Aotearoa) priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to implement and promote national policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure ongoing support and education is provided to centre members to grow understanding of quality early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the appraisal process for employed staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the regional team actively monitors and evaluates the quality of support provided to playcentres to promote improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nuhaka Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance in relation to health and safety. Centre members must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the written emergency plan is reviewed at least annually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when children leave the premises on an excursion an assessment and management of risk is undertaken and the required documentation is completed.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS7, HS17]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice Playcentre Aotearoa must ensure a regular cycle of policy review is undertaken. The organisation has stated that the implementation of national policies will take place at the beginning of August 2019.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
