</table><p>The service needs support to further develop strategic planning, self review, programme planning and assessment, professional leadership and management, and appraisal processes.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Playworx service philosophy is based on the belief that ‚Äòplay is our work and work is our play‚Äô. The programme aims to encourage children to be confident learners who care for themselves and one another. Leaders and teachers promote a sense of belonging for children. The centre owner is committed to providing education and care at a minimum cost to families.</p><p>Playworx is one of three services under the same private ownership. This service is located in an area of high transience and low participation in early childhood education. At the time of this ERO review, eight children were enrolled, most of whom identified as MƒÅori. There has been a significant decrease in the roll since the 2012 ERO review. The centre provides all-day and sessional care and education for children from two years to school age. It is open daily from 8.00am until 3.00pm.</p><p>There is one full-time qualified teacher and two part-time unqualified educators who share a teacher role.</p><p>The previous ERO reviews in 2011 and 2012 identified concerns about the quality of education and care, the directors‚Äô management of the service, professional leadership, teaching practice, and planning, assessment and evaluation. While progress has been made in some areas over the last three years, there remains an urgent need for more organised management and leadership of centre operations, personnel management, and aspects of the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in play and learning. They participate in a wide choice of interesting activities, and enjoy exploring the outdoors and experiencing physical challenges. Children take responsibility for their self-care, assist in setting up and maintaining the environments, and support their peers in tuakana-teina relationships. They demonstrate well-developed skills in art and music and take an interest in the natural world. Children have ready access to well-resourced indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Teachers have caring and trusting relationships with children. They know the children well and are responsive to their interests and ideas. Teachers‚Äô interactions with children promote their oral language skills and guide them to develop positive social skills. Literacy and numeracy are well supported and children demonstrate an interest in books. There is a commitment to including te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers plan the daily programme to follow children‚Äôs interests and promote new learning. However, outcomes for children could be strengthened by identifying intentional teaching strategies to continue and extend their development. Assessment records need to more consistently and clearly identify children‚Äôs learning and evaluate their progress over time.</p><p>Parents are welcome in the centre at any time. Teachers seek their aspirations for their children and work with them to support and strengthen their children‚Äôs wellbeing, confidence and learning. Through individual profile books and photographic displays of learning, parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs participation in centre activities and experiences.</p><p>The service is managed by two directors who are responsible for the centre‚Äôs administration and governance. They have yet to implement effective processes for self review and staff appraisal, and there is a lack of clarity about staff roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified the following areas for further development to sustain and improve the quality of service management and leadership, and outcomes for children.</p><ul>
<li>establish strategic goals that clearly identify priorities towards enacting and achieving the centre philosophy and purpose. These need to be supported by appropriate actions and resources to enable them to be achieved.</li>
<li>continue the review and development of planning, assessment and evaluation practices that consistently interpret and analyse children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playworx completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found areas of non-compliance in Playworx. To meet agreed accountabilities the service provider must ensure that:</p><ol>
<li>An agreed process of regular and ongoing self review for all centre operations, focused on identifying strategic priorities for improving outcomes for children, is implemented<em>.¬†</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA6</em></li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities of management and staff are clarified in order to improve relational trust, communication and collaborative ways of working. Staff members require an allocation of time to implement leadership expectations, critically reflect on their practice, and develop strategies for improvement.¬†<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA7</em></li>
<li>A process for effective, regular and ongoing staff appraisal is implemented. This needs to be linked to the Registered Teachers‚Äô Criteria and focused on improving staff capabilities and outcomes for children.¬†<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA7</em></li>
<li>Individual hazards during excursions are accurately and fully identified and managed. <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: HS12</em></li>
</ol><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Playworx will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
