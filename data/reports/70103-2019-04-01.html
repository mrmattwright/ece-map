</table><p>Selwyn Kids Limited¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Selwyn Kids is licensed under Selwyn Kids Limited, which also operates a kindergarten and before and after school care programme.</p><p>The service is licensed to cater for 80 infants, toddlers and children up to school age. This standard service supports both in-home and nanny educators. The service roll of 95 includes 15 MƒÅori children.</p><p>The service philosophy promotes reciprocal, responsive relationships and celebrates diversity. It states that whƒÅnau aspirations are the key to providing quality care and education for all children. Selwyn Kids Limited is a member of the recently-established NgƒÅ Peko TauwharekƒÅkaho KƒÅhui Ako (Community of Learning) ECE cluster. This membership is enabling the service to build educational relationships with local schools.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 evaluation, there have been changes to the management team. The owner has added visiting kaiako (teachers) to her role until further appointments are made. The manager, who is also a visiting kaiako, works with the owner to develop systems and processes that support the service to improve and sustain its performance. Educators include some ECE-trained teachers, some of whom have relevant NZQA qualifications and others who are training.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Considerable progress, including improvements to health and safety, is evident since ERO's 2015 review.</p><p>The service places an emphasis on children's wellbeing, and supporting nurturing relationships between educators and children. Children are thoughtfully placed with educators, particularly those children with additional learning needs. There is good evidence that educators are responding to children's interests and provide additional resources, including community-based events, to extend the curriculum. Visiting kaiako actively develop educators' knowledge of Te WhƒÅriki, the Early Childhood Curriculum, and support their increasing use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori through coaching and modelling.</p><p>Considerable work is being done to build internal evaluation capacity and capability for improvement. Professional learning and development is supporting visiting kaiako to build their knowledge, systems and use of effective evaluation.</p><p>Systems have been significantly improved to promote sustainability and ensure legal requirements are met. These include a clearer policy and procedure framework to support the monitoring of health and safety in homes. Leaders are working together to develop the newly-established service strategic plan that identifies priorities for operational development.</p><p>The key priority for the service is to clearly identify, articulate and embed the intended and valued learning outcomes for children. This will better support leaders and educators to build purposeful coherence across the service, and more accurately evaluate the extent to which positive learning outcomes are being promoted for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The main next steps to promote positive learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>identifying and embedding valued and equitable outcomes for children, and clarifying in the service philosophy expectations for how this will be enacted in each home</li>
<li>further developing cultural responsiveness within the curriculum to enable success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori, and for all children to develop a deep appreciation for biculturalism in Aotearoa NZ</li>
<li>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation so that leaders are assured of consistent processes and practices that support all children's learning, interests and progress</li>
<li>refining and embedding the reviewed appraisal system.</li>
</ul><p>To promote high quality health and safety practices, leaders must strengthen the consistency of documentation to show that administrative processes have been well implemented in a timely manner.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Selwyn Kids Limited completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>1 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
