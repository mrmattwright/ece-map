</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Havelock North operates Monday to Friday from 7.45am until 5.15pm and is licensed for 25 children over the age of two. The current roll of 33 includes nine children who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Families attend from Havelock North and the wider community, such as Hastings and Flaxmere. Significant interior and exterior renovations and improvements are planned for late 2015 and 2016. The majority of staff are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>ABC Havelock North operates under the umbrella of the national early childhood organisation, BestStart Educare, formerly known as Kidicorp. Locally, a business manager, area manager and a professional services manager work with centres. This support is through scheduled meetings, centre visits, mentoring, appraisal and providing professional development based on centre or regional goals. The centre business plans are directly linked to BestStart Educare strategic and operational plans.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews of ABC centres in Hawke‚Äôs Bay</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are celebrated as confident and competent learners. Their learning is clearly depicted through the photo walls and individual portfolios. All children experience success and their cultures are celebrated.</p><p>Children develop responsibility for their own wellbeing and teachers support and promote their social skills. Children can set their own challenges, develop independence and lead their own learning. Natural resources are used effectively to encourage children‚Äôs development, thinking and creativity. Children‚Äôs learning and interests are fostered and extended in the purposefully planned and well-resourced environment.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in meaningful learning experiences. Adults are guided by the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> follow children‚Äôs interests and extend their experiences. Children make decisions and choices and are encouraged to set and solve problems. There is a focus on developing competence, confidence and independence as learners.</p><p>Centre staff promote strong relationships and partnerships with parents and families. Parents demonstrate that they are comfortable in the centre. Staff are approachable. They work collaboratively alongside each other and whƒÅnau to make children‚Äôs experiences meaningful and fun. Children experiencing success is clearly evident.</p><p>MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau experience respectful relationships with centre personnel. Te¬†reo¬†me¬†ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are naturally woven through the programme. Children and adults demonstrate growing confidence to include te reo MƒÅori in conversations. Children lead karakia and share their pepeha with others.</p><p>Self review has focused on staff building and sustaining responsive and reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and actively promoting success for MƒÅori. Children embrace their cultural identity, which supports their sense of belonging within the centre.</p><p>Teachers effectively use an online tool and hard copy portfolios to support planning and document children‚Äôs learning. This is shared with parents and whƒÅnau. These provide positive links between home and the centre and contribute successfully to an increased level of parent input into the programme. Teachers encourage parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to the curriculum and share aspirations for their children.</p><p>The curriculum is enhanced through teachers‚Äô responses to meaningful professional learning and development (PLD). Through the newly introduced rigorous appraisal system, individual teachers identify where children may benefit from adults‚Äô further training and development. All staff recently attended PLD about supporting children‚Äôs communication. There is a greater understanding and recognition of how children grow their language capabilities.</p><p>Self review is sufficiently robust for the centre to be self improving. Teachers continue to build their knowledge and understanding to bring about improvement for children. A team approach to ensuring that all adults are focused on high quality teaching and learning is evident.</p><p>The newly-formed teaching team has reviewed the centre philosophy and made clear links between the BestStart Educare organisation strategic goals and centre goals. Teachers and management should continue to use self review to sustain positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Havelock North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Havelock North will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>29 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
