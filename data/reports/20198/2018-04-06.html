</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Prodigy Centre - Greenhithe is part of the Prodigy group of centres and operates in a renovated villa. The centre is licensed for up to 50 children, including 15 under the age of two years.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy and vision promote children’s learning, and are evident in teaching practices. The philosophy is closely linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is respected as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand, and teachers’ bicultural practice honours that commitment.</p><p>The owners provide operational systems for centres including policy and budget frameworks. The long-serving centre manager oversees the centre's daily operations, and works with six teaching staff, a cook and four teacher aides.</p><p>ERO’s 2014 report noted positive, respectful relationships and interactions, and good support for children to develop social skills and independence. These aspects remain positive features of the programme. ERO suggested focusing programme planning more on individual children's emerging interests, and providing more high quality learning experiences in the outdoor area. The teaching team is committed to ongoing improvement in these areas. Leaders have worked purposefully to address areas of non-compliance relating to the premises and teacher appraisal that were identified in the 2014 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are welcomed in a home-like environment. A calm and positive tone supports children to settle quickly into the programme. They move between clearly defined areas of play that are attractively presented and invite exploration. Children are confident to work alongside other children and talk about their experiences. They sometimes participate in sustained, cooperative play.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are caring and respectful. They know individual children well and respect their diverse cultural backgrounds. Teachers work alongside children and listen carefully to the ideas that they contribute. They model effective strategies to support children’s developing social skills. The programme provides good support for children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed the way they plan programmes. They have developed planning and evaluation processes that focus on children's individual interests and strengths, and provide experiences that promote positive learning outcomes.</p><p>The learning environment has been deliberately laid out to promote exploration, investigation, creativity, and imaginative play, and is supported by a good selection of resources. A strong focus on literacy, science and mathematics is woven skilfully by teachers as a natural part of children's play. Gardening and planting seasonal edible plants is a key feature in the programme.</p><p>The area for infants and toddlers is peaceful and inviting. There is a considered, slow pace to the programme for this age group. Children enjoy the mixed-age group setting. Younger children stay connected with older siblings. They also have a separate space if they want to play without interruptions.</p><p>Teachers are collaborative and collegial. They seek parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning during conversations at drop-off and pick-up times. The manager has moved her office to the front of the building, which has contributed to a strengthening of positive relationships with whānau.</p><p>The online communication portal has been a success for quick uploading of information about what children are involved in during their time at the centre. Children’s participation in the programme is attractively documented and teachers skilfully identify the learning that happens during children’s play. Teachers could more clearly show children’s learning and progress over time.</p><p>The centre is committed to developing practices that reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Teachers are using resources to increase their use of te reo Māori during group times. They have identified a teacher to lead the team's development. They could now more consistently include te reo Māori in spontaneous interactions with children. Developing a long-term goal to support this centre-wide focus is an appropriate next step.</p><p>Teachers are involved in professional development to strengthen their support for children's learning and their partnerships with families. Centre leaders report that improved practices have benefitted children from diverse cultural groups.</p><p>The centre is well led. The manager works collaboratively with teachers to promote shared team approaches. Staff are focused on continuous improvement. The new teacher appraisal process provides opportunities for teachers to reflect on and develop their practices. They now need to implement and embed this process. Professional development is supporting teachers to strengthen internal evaluation practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening children's portfolio records to clearly and consistently identify their progress, dispositions and continuity of learning</li>
<li>making more use of the information and aspirations shared by parents in planning, assessment and evaluation practices</li>
<li>developing a shared understanding of current early childhood educational theories and effective practices for infant and toddler programmes.</li>
</ul><p>In order to strengthen governance and management practices, the directors/owners and leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>develop an annual plan that links to a strategic plan</li>
<li>monitor how well annual and long term goals are met</li>
<li>ensure policies and procedures reflect and guide current practice</li>
<li>develop a policy and clear procedures around personnel and employment, including staff induction.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Prodigy Centre - Greenhithe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Prodigy Centre - Greenhithe will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><strong> <b>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</b></strong></p><p>6 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
