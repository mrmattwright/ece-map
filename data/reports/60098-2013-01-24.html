<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Early Years Pharazyn Street is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Early Years Pharazyn Street caters for children from infants to school age. The environment includes two distinct areas to meet the differing physical and educational needs of children aged up to and over three years of age. Separate programmes are planned for each age group.</p><p>Early Years is owned and operated by Kidicorp. The original centres for infants and toddlers and a preschool were merged into one licence in February 2012. Teaching philosophy, programme and practices are influenced by Reggio Emilia and Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE) educational approaches.</p><p>Systems are clear. Regular visits and reports from the Professional Services Manager (PSM) and Business Manager (BM) provide professional advice and guidance and monitor children&rsquo;s health and safety. Day-to-day management and responsibility for the programme is delegated to the centre manager and head teacher.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a high quality environment and programme. They are empowered to make responsible decisions and are purposefully engaged in self-chosen activities for prolonged periods. Older children work very collaboratively on group projects, investigating and expressing their ideas, or with their friends in creative and dramatic play. Early literacy and mathematics are well integrated in meaningful ways. Infants and toddlers confidently explore their surroundings and engage in a wide range of activities appropriate to their age. Trusting and respectful relationships between children and teachers are evident. Teachers are positive, sensitive and responsive to children&rsquo;s emotional well-being and communication. A settled and productive atmosphere prevails.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher provide strong and effective leadership focused on quality education and care for young children. They model high quality practice to the teaching team. Together, they successfully lead positive change in the programme, teaching and the learning environment. Staff are mentored supportively and given specific feedback to build their own practice and leadership skills. As a result, there is a team culture of respect and trust that promotes critical reflection and shared understanding and philosophy.</p><p>Self review is thorough, purposeful and strongly evidence based. It is improvement focused and results in positive outcomes for children. There are clear links to the centre vision, philosophy and action plans. Collaborative review practice, led by the centre manager, is building teachers&rsquo; capability. Outcomes of recent reviews include an enhanced learning environment that is stimulating, promotes investigation and reflects te ao M&#257;ori. The centre has identified the need to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop shared team understanding of planned and spontaneous review</li>
<li>purposefully include bicultural perspectives in the review process.</li>
</ul><p>Sound professional leadership is provided by the PSM and BM. Regular meetings with the centre manager assist effective communication and ensure alignment of practice to the organisation&rsquo;s expectations. An appropriate induction and mentoring programme provides good support for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>The appraisal process for the head teacher is yet to include comment or reflection on her leadership role.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Pharazyn Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>24 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" align="left">Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>
