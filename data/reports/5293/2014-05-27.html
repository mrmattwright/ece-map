</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Irongate Kindergarten in Flaxmere, Hastings provides education and care for children aged from two to five years. It is licensed for 40 children and operates six hours, five days per week. Children come from a range of backgrounds and, for some, English is an additional language.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified. The programme is further enhanced through a Pacific support person who acts as a liaison and cultural guide for teachers and families. Teachers work with the associations Pou ƒÄwhina to improve their level of te reo MƒÅori and tikanga practices in the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers value the contributions and support made to the kindergarten by the surrounding community. The philosophy is based on whanaungatanga and is highly valued by teachers. To further support this, developments such as a new whƒÅnau room and a whƒÅnau garden have taken place. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two Education Managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review is part of a cluster of eight reviews of kindergartens in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging and enjoyment when attending the kindergarten. Their wellbeing is paramount to teachers who are warm and welcoming. Staff have positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. They know them and the community well.</p><p>Teachers take time to genuinely listen to children and parents. They offer support in a range of ways. They are highly committed to the vision and philosophy and this is evident in practice. A collaborative approach to leading the team and working together is evident. The programme is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Science, literacy and numeracy are well integrated in the programme. Children initiate their own learning and are engaged in this for sustained periods. Routines allow children to predict what will happen next. Children‚Äôs independence is fostered and their language and vocabulary are well extended.</p><p>Teachers use a range of strategies to support children‚Äôs learning and value opportunities for tuakana teina relationships. Te reo MƒÅori is part of their everyday language. Teachers take personal responsibility for ensuring correct pronunciation and the use of this in the programme.</p><p>The environment provides ample opportunity for children to explore, investigate, problem solve and test ideas. It includes a range of natural and cultural artefacts that reflect the backgrounds of children, their families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Links with external agencies have supported community connections through donations of MƒÅori and Pacific carvings. This supports children to recognise the importance of their culture and the value placed on this by teachers.</p><p>Transitions into the kindergarten and on to school are well supported by positive relationships with whƒÅnau and local schools. Teachers are responsive to the individual needs of children.</p><p>A playgroup has been set up for parents and children who are waiting to be enrolled in the kindergarten. This supports their ability to participate in early childhood education as early as possible. Teachers work with outside agencies to support children who require additional support to participate in the programme and alongside their peers.</p><p>Opportunities for MƒÅori children to enjoy being successful as MƒÅori are deliberately implemented. Children have leadership opportunities in their own culture. Children from Pacific backgrounds are also provided with opportunities to enjoy success. Teachers identify that continuing to seek parent and whƒÅnau contributions to the programme, and to working with them, will benefit children's learning.</p><p>Assessment profiles are well presented and show how teachers are capturing children‚Äôs learning in the moment. Information and communication technologies are being trialled as an assessment tool so teachers can better capture children‚Äôs voices.</p><p>Group planning is evident and a recent individual planning process is in the initial stages of implementation. Ensuring that review of planning looks at how well this has improved outcomes for children, should be a consideration for teachers.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear long term-direction for the association.</p><p>Teachers are well supported through regular visits from the education managers who provide support and guidance and access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>There is a commitment by the association to increase teachers‚Äô capabilities in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori through the introduction of the Haere Whakamua project. This project is based on progressing the organisation‚Äôs journey to becoming bicultural.</p><p>The association identifies and ERO agrees that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>updating the appraisal policy and process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing clear expectations through guiding documents for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, and monitoring their implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers and use this information to inform future decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that they should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen management plans to be more useful as guidelines and procedures for future staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve assessment and planning to more effectively show children‚Äôs significant learning and progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further unpack aspects of the philosophy and identify measurable indicators of quality for future review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarify the use of evaluative self review as a tool to improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish and review current guiding documents and monitor implementation</p>
</li>
<li>build and strengthen strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Irongate Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Irongate Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
