</table><p>Ficino Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ficino Preschool was opened during 2016 in the grounds of Ficino School. It offers full-time education and care for 30 children over the age of two years. One of its purposes is to support children as they transition to Ficino School. The preschool is governed by the Ficino Educational Trust board which provides an overarching policy and management framework.</p><p>The preschool is led by a head teacher. Three other qualified teachers, unqualified part-time teachers and a teacher aide complete the teaching team.</p><p>Children have opportunities to play together and have easy access to a large outside area. Teachers and children use a multipurpose room and utilise the close proximity of the school where they participate in specialist teaching and learning. The preschool's philosophy strives for a holistic approach that carefully nurtures children through love and play.</p><p>The preschool caters for a variety of cultures, with the largest proportion being Chinese. Teachers reflect some of the diverse cultures represented in the preschool.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily into the service routines and play collaboratively or independently. Teacher and child affirming relationships are a feature of the preschool. Children know the routines well and move confidently between the activities. They have many opportunities to participate in local community events. Teachers value the relationships they have with parents and encourage their input into the programme. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging within the whole school community.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are well catered for. Teachers know the children and their families well and implement useful strategies to support them. The head teacher collaborates with external agencies when extra support and expertise is required.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn about te ao MƒÅori and te reo MƒÅori. Children participate in MƒÅori and Pacific language week activities.</p><p>The curriculum is philosophically based and supports children‚Äôs transition into Ficino School. Children‚Äôs interests are noticed and their dispositions and skills recognised. Teachers then prepare the learning spaces with activities to provoke and enhance these interests and skills. Teachers and children celebrate when children display the centre's virtues and values. The head teacher has identified strategic outcomes for children. It would be useful if teachers collaboratively define what the concepts in these outcomes could look like when children display them. They could use these indicators of good practice to evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching practices.</p><p>Assessment of children's dispositional learning is recorded in portfolios of learning stories. At present many of these learning stories are group stories of children's participation in activities. Teachers should now plan ways to extend children's learning dispositions through deliberate acts of teaching, and show individual children's progress over time in the learning stories. Teachers need to consider ways for children to further lead their own learning through a play-based curriculum, and have more opportunities for uninterrupted, sustained and self-selected play.</p><p>Teachers should review the transition to school programme with a view to ensuring that the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, are evident in the planning for transition, and focus on children learning school-readiness skills during play.</p><p>Teachers have been trialling a variety of frameworks to plan for children's learning. Further development of frameworks that clearly capture multiple voices as well as children's skills could improve teachers' evaluation of the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The preschool's strategic plan aligns to the Ficino School plan. Strategic and annual plans would be more useful if they identified preschool-specific goals to further improve children‚Äôs learning, and ways to meet these goals. These could be recorded and evaluated in the annual plan.</p><p>Teachers have opportunities to participate in appropriate professional learning and development (PLD) to enhance the philosophical curriculum and teacher practice. Teachers would benefit from ongoing participation in PLD around <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> The preschool has been trialling a variety of ways of managing staff performance. They should ensure a process is now embedded so that teachers are appraised annually.</p><p>The head teacher has implemented a useful framework for guiding internal evaluation. Teachers should undertake PLD to increase their capability to evaluate all preschool operations in relation to valued outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and teacher agree that useful next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluating the transition to school programme in line with the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teacher understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teacher capability with internal evaluation to evaluate the impact of their teaching practices on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to access external expertise and use internal capability to enhance internal evaluation processes for ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ficino Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the head teacher should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review policies and procedures to ensure the employment policy reflects preschool practices and meets the requirements of the Vulnerable Children's Act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use internal evaluation processes to identify the effectiveness of teaching practices on outcomes for children, and on all preschool operations for ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
