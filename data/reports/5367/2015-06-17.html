</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ngaio Kindergarten is situated close to local schools and community facilities in the suburb of Ngaio. Up to forty children attend each day. Recent changes to hours of operation mean the kindergarten now provides education and care for six hours each day.</p><p>Ngaio Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered at Ngaio Kindergarten. Some are new to the kindergarten since the December 2011 ERO report, including the head teacher. The centre philosophy emphasises equitable opportunities for all, and children are viewed as capable and competent, in a welcoming environment where play is valued.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs previous ERO report identified that assessment practices and self review needed further development. Many areas recognised as strengths have been sustained. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association‚Äôs strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 kindergarten reviews in He WhƒÅnau Manaaki kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a positive sense of belonging. They confidently share their ideas with others and make decisions about their learning. ERO observed examples of children helping each other. There are high levels of sustained play evident. Caring teachers foster children‚Äôs independence and social skills. Parents and caregivers are made to feel welcome.</p><p>Teachers use a good range of practices that effectively build on children‚Äôs interests and thinking. This includes making links with prior learning, use of questioning and adding resources to extend play. Purposeful resourcing encourages curiosity, discovery and physical challenges. Literacy and numeracy experiences are promoted and encouraged.</p><p>Re-establishing links with local schools is supporting children and families as they move on to school. Teachers continue to explore more ways to support transitions.</p><p>There has been considerable progress in improving centre planning processes. They clearly focus on aspects of learning and teaching that are occurring and are visible for parents through attractive and purposeful wall displays. Assessment portfolios are an attractive record of children‚Äôs participation and involvement in centre experiences and activities. ERO's evaluation affirms the next steps identified by leaders to further extend and deepen these processes.</p><p>Teachers are building their understanding of self review. This is helping to guide decisions for improvement. Well-targeted support from the senior teacher has identified areas to further grow review processes.</p><p>A culture of reflection is evident. Teachers work collaboratively to develop and progress the kindergarten‚Äôs strategic annual teaching and learning goals. Teachers‚Äô strengths contribute to kindergarten developments.</p><p>Children with additional learning and teaching needs are well supported in the programme.</p><p>Children have some opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they need to build their capability to be responsive to MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture, language, and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as,<em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success</em> <em>2013 - 2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners.</em></p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. These continue to require strengthening. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te¬†Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning. The curriculum provided for children at Ngaio Kindergarten increasingly promotes their wellbeing and learning outcomes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, teachers and ERO agree on the following key next steps:</p><ul>
<li>building on and embedding self-review processes</li>
<li>extending aspects of assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>promoting further ways for MƒÅori to achieve success as MƒÅori, and Pacific learners to achieve success as Pacific.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improvements to the quality and monitoring of individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ngaio Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ngaio Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" align="left" title="">Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
