</table><p>Lalaga Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lalaga Preschool provides education and care for up to 35 children from 7.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday. This includes up to 12 children under two years old. At the time of the July 2016 ERO review, the centre was licensed as Puna ole Malamalama Aoga Amata.</p><p>The philosophy supports children to be nurtured and to grow in the love of Christ, be cared for and supported in a warm and inclusive environment, and learn biblical principles and Samoan cultural values.</p><p>Core values of tautua (service and responsibility), alofa (aroha, love and commitment) and fa'aaloalo (respect, dignity and relationships) are embedded and underpin the centre's philosophy.</p><p>Four of the seven teachers are early childhood trained and certificated, one is primary trained and certificated, and two are in training. They are committed to developing their bicultural practice and recognise the importance of integrating <em>Te WhƒÅriki (2017)</em>, the early childhood curriculum, across the teaching and learning programme.</p><p>The centre is governed by a trust board of church, parent and teacher representatives. The centre manager oversees the day-to-day running of the centre, a head teacher has oversight of the curriculum and teaching and learning, and two senior teachers are responsible for each classroom.</p><p>The centre has responded well to addressing the key next steps in the 2016 ERO report. This includes the development of a new framework for assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in an environment where Samoan language, culture and identity are valued. This language development is nurtured and sustained through meaningful interactions with peers and adults. They benefit from a range of learning opportunities that are responsive to their interests, abilities and strengths.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience positive, sensitive and responsive interactions with their teachers. Adults maintain a calm and unhurried pace, in which younger children have space and time to lead their learning. Experienced teachers provide ongoing support with the extension of the Samoan language in the programme.</p><p>Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are meaningfully integrated into the programme and align with the centre's philosophy and core values. Te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori practices have been strengthened over time through an ongoing commitment from leaders and teachers. These are embedded and enacted by children and adults.</p><p>The curriculum is broad, well-structured and managed across the service. Each learning area is resourced appropriately to cater to the diverse needs and ages of all children. Opportunities for children to take part in meaningful and purposeful experiences are well promoted. Early literacy and numeracy are suitably promoted by teachers, with a strong focus on building children's oral language skills.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a strong commitment to improvement that contributes to positive outcomes for children. Good use is made of professional learning and development opportunities to support and strengthen systems and processes. There is purposeful integration of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, in assessment and planning.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and collaborative. They know children and their families well and use focused observations as a way to identify their strengths and interests, plan their goals, and as a basis for discussions about their learning and progress.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work in partnership with parents of children with additional needs to improve their learning opportunities. Well considered strategies support culturally diverse learners to participate in the programme.</p><p>The service is welcoming to all parents and families. There are responsive and reciprocal relationships between children, teachers, families, and the wider community. Links between the centre and homes are well established. Parent's input and families' aspirations for their children's learning are valued and regularly sought to guide planning.</p><p>The board, leaders and teachers share a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre. Policies and procedures guide inclusive practice at all levels of the service. Leaders are responsive to issues, concerns and questions from parents and families.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused and use internal evaluation to inform next steps for ongoing improvement. They should undertake a deeper analysis of the information gathered and use this to make judgements about the effectiveness of the curriculum and teaching practice with respect to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Transition processes are well-managed within and beyond the service. Careful consideration is given to supporting those children getting ready to go to school to develop the social and self-management skills they need to adapt well to a new environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Lalaga Preschool leaders, the Trust Board, and ERO agree that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and build on recently introduced systems for assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and build on the appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the safety system upgrade is completed.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lalaga Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
