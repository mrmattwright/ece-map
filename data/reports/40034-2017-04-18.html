</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group is a well-established community operated service, governed by an elected parent board. It is located at Lake Okareka, east of Rotorua. The centre operates quality adult-to-child ratios above minimal regulatory requirements and is licensed for 25 children aged over two years of age. The service provides sessional education in the mornings, Monday to Friday, with three extended sessions each week for older children. The preschool manager and teachers are all fully registered early childhood teachers. They have all remained in the service for a considerable length of time, providing continuity for children and their families.</p><p>The preschool has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the last ERO review the board and teachers have constructively responded to the next steps identified in the 2014 ERO report resulting in ongoing development and improvement to the quality of education and care. Initiatives have included further developing assessment practices that encourage children and families to share their goals and aspirations for learning. An appraisal framework has been implemented that meets Education Council requirements. Internal evaluation processes have focused on growing teachers' professional practice and promoting positive outcomes for children, families and the community.</p><p>The board and teaching team have shared values and these promote a holistic learning environment. Children are valued and parents, whānau and caregivers are viewed as an integral part of children's learning. Children will be nurtured in a community-orientated setting, empowering them to reach their potential as considerate, capable and competent learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Parent, extended family and community involvement in children's education continues to be a strength of the service. The service's philosophy and vision are strongly evident in practice. Documented goals prioritise equitable learning opportunities for all children. The centre is very well placed to sustain high quality education and care for children in partnership with families and the community.</p><p>Children are empowered to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of others and the immediate and wider environments. They enjoy trusting, positive and responsive relationships with teachers, parents/whānau and peers. Teachers and parent helpers model high levels of respect for children. Children are consistently affirmed for their contributions and efforts, supporting them to be confident capable learners.</p><p>Teachers understand the importance of working in partnership with families and community to promote positive outcomes for children's learning. Children experience a rich curriculum that is responsive to individual cultures, identity, interests and strengths. Children are developing a good understands of te reo and tikanga Māori, which is naturally integrated into the life of the centre. This supports children's development of self, belonging and connectedness.</p><p>Teacher's work strongly reflects the principles, goals, dispositions and learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers know about current theories of learning, teaching and development. They skilfully use this knowledge to design a contextually relevant, responsive programme catering for the diverse interests and abilities of all children. Literacy, mathematics, science and sustainability concepts are naturally integrated into child-led exploration and investigation.</p><p>Teachers ensure the physical environment is stimulating and provides children with challenges to extend their own learning through play that builds on interests and strengths. Well-established health and safety processes and systems are effectively monitored to maintain a physically safe learning environment. The community garden is tended and sustained by the children and the community. Children's learning and connections to the environment help them develop comprehensive knowledge in sustainability and in caring for the world they live in. The physical and material environment provides children with many opportunities to problem solve, use their imagination and be creative.</p><p>Children are able to engage in meaningful, complex and sustained learning within a social setting. Interactions with others and the environment nurture children's communication skills and social competence. Teachers are highly effective in using a wide range of intentional teaching strategies. They skilfully observe, recognise potential learning opportunities and respond to engage and extend children's thinking and learning. Children are encouraged to research topics of interest and build their knowledge, skills and learning dispositions. Teachers provide regular feedback to children that acknowledges their efforts and success. Children understand concepts about fairness, justice and equity, and are well supported to develop their confidence and competence as lifelong learners.</p><p>Child assessment profiles provide a rich record of children's learning overtime and clearly reflects their identity as successful learners. Teachers are now considering the value of introducing on-line assessment to further support children's holistic development and learning, through increasing extended family and community contribution to assessment practices.</p><p>The centre manager, teaching team and board have well-established internal evaluation practices to continually improve and develop preschool operations, practices and promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers liaise with a range of other educational specialists to cater for the particular and unique needs of individuals. A new initiative has been teachers' engagement in the Rotorua East Side Hub. This is made up of nine other early childhood services and schools in the surrounding areas, and enables professional conversations about teaching and learning to be shared. This initiative is helping children's transition to school.</p><p>Board members are highly effective in governing the service. They receive regular reports from the head teacher and share information with the community about decision making. They value the experienced teaching team. Teachers have access professional development to keep up-to-date with current research about best practice.</p><p>Over many years the preschool has maintained a collaborative and shared approach to leadership. Teachers, parents, and extended family members are encouraged to share their strengths and talents to enrich the education and care provided by the centre. The centre manager promotes a distributive leadership approach to decision making and for the smooth running of the preschool. The highly inclusive and collaborative approach with children, families and community supports all to focus on providing the best possible outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers should undertake further research into the benefits of implementing on-line assessment portfolios, to further enhance children's holistic development and learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>18 April 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
