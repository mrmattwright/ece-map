</table><p>Sancta Maria Montessori Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sancta Maria Montessori is one of three privately-owned preschool centres in Christchurch. It opens five days a week from 8am until 3.30pm. Twenty three children from two years old to school age learn in this mixed-aged setting. The centre has stable staffing. A manager runs the day-to-day operations. The owners manage the administration of all three centres.</p><p>A strength of the centre is that most children and teachers at this centre are from diverse cultures. Teachers are highly proficient and qualified in English medium but are also multilingual. This is a significant feature of this centre that contributes to positive outcomes for the children.</p><p>The centre is purpose-built with an emphasis on natural materials. The centre's philosophy and practices, underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki (2017) The Early Childhood Curriculum</em>, Catholic teachings and Montessori methods, support the child's learning and spiritual growth.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have worked to address the recommendations from the 2016 ERO report. These continue to be work in progress.</p><p>The centre belongs to the Upper Riccarton KƒÅhui Ako|Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, caring relationships. Children know the teachers and trust them to support their learning and needs. The family-like atmosphere, which extends to events beyond the centre environment, helps children and their families to develop socially and spiritually.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have created an inclusive culture which celebrates diversity. Children's home languages and cultures are valued and promoted. Parents are actively encouraged to bring their expertise and country's traditions to enhance the curriculum and children's learning. Leaders and teachers are working to further develop learning partnerships with parents. A range of communication tools are used to ensure parents are kept well informed about their child's day and learning.</p><p>The centre is very well resourced with specialised Montessori equipment. This, along with skilful teaching, provides children of all ages with intellectual challenge. The centre owner models authentic Montessori practices and a child-centred approach. Children are supported to make purposeful choices about their learning. This helps them to develop independence and self-management skills.</p><p>Teachers deliver the Montessori curriculum with knowledge and passion. Recent professional development is supporting teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their practice. It is also helping them to establish and implement a new appraisal process. Teachers are collegial and plan for children's learning collaboratively.</p><p>The design of this purpose-built centre takes account of acoustics, children and adult needs in an open-plan space, and gives teachers full view of all children at all times. The spacious room has designated areas such as an atrium, which is set apart for the daily inclusion of Catholic religious traditions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Assessment and reporting practices could be strengthened by teachers reflecting more explicitly and consistently in learning stories how they plan to extend children's learning.</p><p>It would be timely to review the centre's philosophy to more clearly express desired outcomes such as children developing a 'love for learning', and to include a reference to the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>Leaders and teachers now need to strengthen strategic planning and the internal evaluation processes to know better the impact of their teaching and programmes on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sancta Maria Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>10 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
