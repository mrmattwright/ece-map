</table><p>The Owls Nest Preschool Limited¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Owls Nest Preschool Limited has experienced changes in key staff in its first year of operation that have impacted on its progress. As a result, the service needs further time and support to develop curriculum planning, assessment and internal evaluation practices, and the policy framework that guides centre practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Owls Nest Preschool Limited is a new early learning service which opened in February 2017. It is licensed for 28 children over the age of two. At the time of this review there were 14 children on the roll.</p><p>The centre is privately owned and operates out of a converted house in a residential neighbourhood. The resources and outdoor environment reflect a commitment to incorporating natural resources. The owner and staff are qualified early childhood teachers. The centre aims to provide a rich bicultural environment where children feel safe to explore, initiate their own learning and express themselves.</p><p>In its first year of operation the centre experienced a change in curriculum leadership. This is the first ERO report for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner has a strong vision for the service. This vision and associated planning documents reflect a commitment to high quality early childhood education for all children, and sets clear expectations for the conditions that the service will promote to support all children's learning.</p><p>Children have regular opportunities to spend long periods of time in meaningful interactions with their teachers, and to be involved in small group play with other children. Centre leaders promote small group size and high ratios of staff-to-children.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's interests and regularly plan for their learning. Teachers become actively engaged in children's play. They recognise and value the importance of children learning through play and support children's choices and ideas. Teachers' planning demonstrates that they provide a wide range of curriculum experiences and resources to extend children's learning. Teachers make good use of the adjacent park to extend the curriculum and learning environment for children.</p><p>In 2018, the centre owner and new head teacher undertook a number of useful reviews that have strengthened centre systems and staff knowledge and awareness. This has been particularly evident in the introduction of foundation systems for planning and assessment practices and bicultural aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>The owner and new head teacher acknowledge they need to work more with the revised Te WhƒÅriki 2017 NZ Early Childhood Curriculum to develop and successfully embed the design of their local curriculum, assessment and planning practices.</p><p>The centre owner and teachers value parent contribution and place considerable emphasis on involving parents in centre activities and events. They have developed a useful range of ways to share information with parents about children's participation in the daily programme.</p><p>The owner and head teacher work collaboratively and have a shared approach to centre improvement and building centre systems. The owner and teachers have been appropriately introducing new systems in the establishment of the centre. They are in the early stages of understanding how to use internal evaluation processes in ways that evaluate the effectiveness of practices in supporting outcomes for learners.</p><p>Since opening the service, the owner has been familiarising himself with operational matters and with developing systems and policies. The policy framework now needs to be updated and strengthened to better reflect actual practice, now that the services is in operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service provider needs more tailored support from the Ministry of Education to build the service's capacity.</p><p>Key priorities are for the owner and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>extend knowledge and understanding of Te WhƒÅriki 2017 to build on curriculum design and planning, assessment and evaluation practices</li>
<li>gain further knowledge of internal evaluation so that it can be used as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of systems and practices in improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen the policy and procedure framework to better reflect the current practices of the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Owls Nest Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to an aspect of safety checking according to the requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act.</p><p>In addition, ERO found that the service needs to strengthen aspects of its policy and procedure framework to ensure these reflect current centre practice.</p><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>the service is effectively governed and is managed in accordance with good management practices.</li>
</ul><p>Regulation 47 1 (a) (c) GMA6, GMA7A Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Owls Nest Preschool Limited will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>30 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
