<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>This is the first ERO review of this Hop Skip Learn home-based educare network. The network is one of three more recent additions to KiwiOz Nannies, a well established and successfully operating nanny recruitment, placement and support organisation. Each network has a co-ordinator who is responsible for supporting the delivery of programmes for children.</p><p>Children are cared for in their own homes by affectionate and caring nanny educators. High quality, respectful relationships nurture children&rsquo;s emotional wellbeing and provide a sound foundation for their learning. The continuation of home routines, and the affirmation of children, their cultures and family structures by nanny educators effectively promote children&rsquo;s sense of belonging.</p><p>The Hop Skip Learn programme is helping nannies to maximise children&rsquo;s learning. The programme encourages children&rsquo;s participation in real life experiences. It enhances their independent exploration and promotes meaningful and enthusiastic learning. Children enjoy well resourced home learning environments, together with trips, visits and socialisation activities with other children. They benefit from the overall high quality of interactions they have with their nannies.</p><p>The Hop Skip Learn programme and networks are very well led and managed. Service leaders demonstrate high levels of capability. Their high expectations and well developed quality assurance processes feature in all service operations. Effective self review is promoting evidence-based and ongoing improvement. As a result, children and their families are very well served by the network.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Hop Skip Learn supports nanny educators to implement the service&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum. The support includes regular visits from a network coordinator who is a registered teacher. Nannies are also provided with resources, professional development, activity mornings and an organised series of trips and outings. The programme encourages nannies to focus on children&rsquo;s learning. It keeps parents well informed and includes an appropriate emphasis on health and safety monitoring.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>The strong, network-wide focus on positive relationships helps ensure children are immersed in affirming, nurturing and respectful environments. It encourages high levels of cooperation between the coordinator and nannies as they work together to implement programme planning, assessment and evaluation. Positive relationships promote effective partnerships with families, their nannies and network managers. These positive relationships encourage nannies to extend their practices and try out new ideas and approaches.</p><p>Children gain security from the fact that that they are cared for in their homes. Most homes contain a good amount of play equipment, as well as literacy support materials. Most homes also feature easily accessed outdoor play areas. Nannies use the home-based learning environment well to support children&rsquo;s routines and activity-based learning. They effectively integrate early numeracy skills into their activities in low key and appropriate ways.</p><p>A varied range of additional learning opportunities complements home-centred learning. Some children attend additional early childhood centres and most participate in music sessions, local playgroups, library sessions and/or events organised by Hop Skip Learn. Nannies and families work with local schools to help ensure children transition to school smoothly. The Hop Skip Learn programme provides regular support for nannies to implement the bicultural aspect of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Interactions are of a high quality. Nannies are very responsive to the cues of non-verbal children. The conversations they have with children help extend children&rsquo;s language and learning. Network coordinators effectively model ways to further increase the complexity of children&rsquo;s language skills. Children are becoming confident, capable learners who demonstrate the advantages of their rich interactions and socialisation opportunities.</p><p>Effective management underpins the high quality of provisions for children. Nannies are carefully matched to children and families, resulting in stable and consistent relationships that support children&rsquo;s learning. Nanny appraisal processes encourage self-reflection and goal setting. Clear and well established management procedures guide health and safety practices and support nannies to focus on children and their needs.</p><p>Leadership of the Hop Skip Learn networks is strong. The owner is interested in the learning of young children and is strongly committed to providing an exemplary service for them and their families. Network co-ordinators are successfully helping nannies to notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Effective self review promotes a continuation of high quality of provisions for children and their families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO, the owner and network coordinator agree that next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>helping nannies and families to increase their understanding of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and the purposes and advantages of the Hop Skip Learn programme</li>
<li>continuing to support nannies to strengthen their planning for, and assessing of, children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>introducing a more formal means of passing on information about children&rsquo;s learning abilities as they transition to school</li>
<li>linking the teacher appraisal processes to the Registered Teachers Criteria</li>
<li>ensuring there is alignment in the policy, procedures and practices of KiwiOz Nannies and the Hop Skip Learn networks.</li>
</ul><p>ERO, the owner and network coordinators agreed that matching professional development opportunities with the learning levels of individual nannies would also be a useful area for consideration.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Hop Skip Learn 01 completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the service owner agreed that the owner should now consider developing a more goalbased strategic plan to better guide annual planning and the provision of differentiated professional development for nannies.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 October 2013</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
