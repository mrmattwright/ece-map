</table><p>Bizzy Kidz Childcare owners and teachers are well placed to continue systematically planning to improve the curriculum and begin establishing effective internal evaluation to further promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bizzy Kidz Childcare opened in 2014 in a large, renovated warehouse. The owners are qualified early childhood teachers. They oversee centre governance and management and are closely involved in the centre's daily operations. The centre is licensed for 80 children, including up to 30 under two years of age. Occupancy rates have been consistently high for the past two years.</p><p>The centre provides programmes in two age-related groups. The Rā room caters for children up to two years of age and is led by a supervisor and the teaching team. Rāngi caters for children over two years old and teachers in this room rotate the role of team monitor.</p><p>Most children have Pacific heritage, being mainly Tongan, Samoan and Cook Island Māori. The next biggest groups are Pākehā and Māori. Other ethnic groups make up 20 percent of the roll.</p><p>The centre's philosophy acknowledges children as unique individuals. It espouses a commitment to developing children's sense of belonging through positive relationships with peers and adults. It also values meaningful learning through play that enables children to become independent, confident and competent individuals. Teachers are developing an understanding of what this means for their practice.</p><p>The centre employs 18 staff including nine qualified teachers. In 2014 many staff transferred to this service from the owners' first centre. Staffing has been stable this year with one new member joining the team.</p><p>This is the first review of Bizzy Kidz Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and confident. They are curious to explore and are encouraged to share their ideas. Literacy, mathematics, science and physical activity are included in many aspects of the programme. Children's home languages and cultures are reflected in the centre's environment, documentation and curriculum.</p><p>The children in Rā experience a programme that is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are aware of the particular needs of infants and toddlers. There is a calm, unhurried pace to the day. Children receive affectionate care and are secure in their relationships with adults. There is good support for their oral language development. Teachers should continue to reflect on the Pikler theory that underpins their room's philosophy and what this means for their practice.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to implement child-led learning through play and should now provide greater challenge and complexity for children. They have made good progress with integrating te reo Māori and bicultural practices in programmes. Teachers should review the effectiveness of children's engagement in the learning environment and use observations of children's play to inform planning. This use of teachers' knowledge about children should help to make the continuity of learning for individual children more visible.</p><p>The owners have implemented efficient administration systems and developed a vision and philosophy that guide the centre's strategic direction. There is further work needed to link the strategic plan to internal evaluation findings. Owners and teachers should monitor the extent to which outcomes for children improve over time as a result of internal evaluation and strategic planning. The owners agree that they should establish a cycle of policy review to ensure that centre policies and practices remain up to date.</p><p>The owners have focused on building trusting, respectful team relationships. Teachers access some external professional development and networks that are contributing to shared understandings in relation to current theories about teaching and learning. The owners agree that teachers' appraisals needs to be strengthened to support their professional learning and to improve their leadership capability. Professional development should include learning about positive guidance and internal evaluation that improves the quality of teaching.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities to improve outcomes for children and centre sustainability agreed between the owners and ERO in the course of this review include external professional support to improve and embed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching practices that support an emergent curriculum and children's developing social competence.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service develops and systematically implements a plan to address the areas for development and key next steps identified in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bizzy Kidz Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bizzy Kidz Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>7 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children. </li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
