</table><p>BestStart Mosgiel¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Mosgiel provides all-day education and care for children, Monday to Friday. It is licensed for 55, including up to 15 under-two-year olds. Children learn and play in two rooms (Acorns for infants and toddlers; Mighty Oaks for older children). There has been extensive redevelopment of the indoor environment in the last two years.</p><p>The service is governed by BestStart Educare Ltd, a national organisation. A manager runs the day-to-day operations and head teachers have oversight of the two rooms. A BestStart professional services manager and a business manager support the centre and visit regularly. The manager, one head teacher and some of the teachers are new to this service.</p><p>The philosophy includes the learning priorities for children of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>tino rangatiratanga; developing the intrinsic motivation to be lifelong learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manaakitanga and whanaungatanga; respecting and caring for themselves, others, their community and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wananga and t≈´rangawaewae; essential life skills and knowing who they are and where they belong.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have made very good progress in addressing most of the key next steps in the 2016 ERO report. Extending and strengthening aspects of internal evaluation continues to be a priority.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the respectful, positive and caring interactions and relationships they have with their teachers. The focus on building their self-help and independence skills, identified in the philosophy, is clearly evident in practice. Children enjoy sustained interactions with each other and the engaging conversations and games they have with their teachers.</p><p>The centre's collaboratively developed philosophy and learning priorities contribute significantly to its localised curriculum. This is becoming increasingly evident in teachers' planning for learning and the way in which the environment is intentionally prepared. Children are encouraged to be inquisitive and to experiment, explore and question.</p><p>The centre is achieving positive outcomes for children. This is evident in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the variety of broad and rich learning experiences that result in high levels of engagement, interest, physical activity and fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the sense of belonging evident in the way children are comfortable in the centre, with teachers and their peers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the strong support provided for children's wellbeing</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children's (and teachers') learning experiences are deepened through the useful partnerships teaching teams are developing with parents. Leaders draw on parent expertise to enrich learning about aspects of te ao MƒÅori in Aotearoa New Zealand. This should support MƒÅori children to know that their language, culture and identity are valued.</p><p>Parents' aspirations for their children are intentionally sought, valued and included in planning for their learning. Parents and children benefit from the responsive way in which children's transitions through the centre and to school is being managed.</p><p>Infants and toddlers learn in an environment which is intentionally arranged to support their exploration and ongoing development. Routines are predictable yet flexible. Teachers' interactions with children are respectful and nurturing. Infants' and toddlers' growing independence is supported in carefully managed ways.</p><p>Leaders are focused on improvement and have made good progress in increasing the consistency of practice. Clarifying expectations and team building have contributed to this. Useful guidelines and frameworks positively support teachers to develop a shared understanding and contribute to the future direction of the centre. Aspects of leadership are being shared more widely with teachers.</p><p>A reflective team culture is evident. Leaders show drive and motivation to do the best for the children and the community. There is further scope for increasing the team's understanding and use of systematic, collaborative internal evaluation to better support decisions about change and improvement.</p><p>BestStart provides effective support for practice and operation. Effective systems are in place to monitor health and safety. A comprehensive appraisal system supports teachers to improve their practice. Professional development is provided to build the team's capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers, leaders and teachers at the centre have identified, and ERO's evaluation confirms that internal evaluation and planning at various levels of the centre's organisation require strengthening. Priorities for development are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to establish consistency in planning for children's learning including working towards achieving identified learning priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring teachers consistently evaluate the impact of teaching strategies on planned outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>drawing widely from relevant information to evaluate how well the centre's curriculum is supporting children to achieve the identified learning priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Managers and leaders should continue to build teachers' capability and use of internal evaluation processes as a means for making improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Mosgiel completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>9 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
