</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hokowhitu Children‚Äôs Centre is a non-profit parent cooperative. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 70 children, including 24 up to the age of two years. There are two main indoor learning areas, one for children over two years of age and the other for the younger children. Each of these areas has a head teacher and specific teaching team.</p><p>A parent-led management committee is responsible for governing the service, all members are new to this role in 2018. There have been changes to staffing since the December 2015 ERO report.</p><p>A new centre supervisor and head teacher, in the learning area for older children, were appointed in March of this year. There are also some new teaching staff.</p><p>The whakatauki, 'Ko te piko o te mƒÅhuri, tƒìrƒÅ te tupu o te rƒÅkau', 'The way the sapling is shaped determines how the tree grows', encapsulates the service‚Äôs philosophy, ‚ÄòHand in hand: Learning and growing‚Äô. These shared values and beliefs guide positive child-teacher-family relationships to support the development of children's identity.</p><p>The centre's staff and community is representative of a diverse range of ethnicities.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key next steps for this service as establishing priorities for learning, internal evaluation and strengthening strategic and annual planning. Good progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's wellbeing and learning is enhanced through their active involvement in the service's well-considered and implemented, culturally responsive curriculum. The centre philosophy aligns with the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and is highly evident in practice. Whanaungatanga underpins teaching and learning.</p><p>A positive atmosphere permeates the centre. The services youngest children's holistic development is promoted within a culture of care and nurture. Responsive teachers know the children and their preferences well. This knowledge, and the calm and unhurried curriculum provide a very positive platform for learning and progress.</p><p>The meaningful inclusion of te ao MƒÅori and te reo MƒÅori is purposefully planned, giving emphasis to MƒÅori learners' culture, language and identity as tangata whenua. Pacific and all families' cultures and languages are incorporated in the curriculum through celebrations and learning experiences.</p><p>Strong learning partnerships develop between teachers, families and whƒÅnau. Centre practices enable teachers to regularly share information about children's learning and progress with families. This contributes well to continuity of care and learning between homes and the centre. If a child has additional learning needs, these relationships are extended to include external agencies if deemed appropriate.</p><p>Teaching staff are highly reflective practitioners. They undertake research collaboratively, build shared understandings of effective practice and adapt and review teaching and the curriculum aligned to this new knowledge.</p><p>The new governance committee members and centre leaders are developing their understanding of collective expectations for their roles and responsibilities. Actions are underway to build capacity through improved strategic planning. Self review for accountability and improvement is well understood.</p><p>The committee and teachers are making good progress reviewing policies and procedures. Leaders recognise human resource management practices require further improvement. As a priority, leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formally appraise the centre supervisor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement the newly developed appraisal process for all teaching staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure appraisal procedures and practice meet all the requirements of the Education Council for issuing and renewal of teachers' practising certificates.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build teachers' capability to use internal evaluation effectively to sustain and continually improve teaching and learning for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen human resource management practices, including appraisal for all teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hokowhitu Children's Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hokowhitu Children's Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>6 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
