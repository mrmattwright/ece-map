</table><p>The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora is an early intervention service for infants and young children with complex developmental challenges. Services are centre-based and multi-disciplinary including physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, early intervention teachers and social workers. All children attend with a parent/caregiver on a regular day once a week. Children are involved in sessions of intensive and small group work with specialist teaching and a therapy team.</p><p>The service is governed by a charitable trust. The board includes members of the health and education sectors and parent representatives. A director is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the service.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises that:</p><ul>
<li>the needs of children are paramount</li>
<li>the cultures, beliefs and values of each family are respected</li>
<li>a positive, supportive and creative environment is provided</li>
<li>staff advocate on behalf of children and families to ensure the rights of the child and their capacity to reach their full potential.</li>
</ul><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the centre has continued to provide high quality outcomes for children and their families. More systematically documenting some aspects of internal evaluation remains an area for continuing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be confident and motivated learners. They are well supported by a team of multi-disciplinary professionals who know each child and their family very well. Team members skilfully plan individual programmes that are fun, challenging and engage the child. They successfully use their knowledge of the child and their professional expertise to build the child's capacity and capabilities to achieve their learning goals.</p><p>Children are well supported to be independent, responsive and socially competent. Home cultures, beliefs and values are respected. The development of appropriate communication and social skills are naturally included in the interactions teachers and other professionals have with each child. The individualised nature of the teaching ensures each child receives the praise, recognition and support that they need to be successful.</p><p>Children are well prepared for school. Leaders and teachers have made effective use of internal evaluation, current research and professional knowledge to develop a comprehensive transition to school programme. The child is central in the process. The focus is on the child settling easily and the class teacher knowing the child well as an individual and as a learner. A comprehensive report carefully links what the child knows and has achieved to the school learning environment. The report provides clear guidance on how best to support the child in a range of situations. Feedback from schools and families has been positive and appreciative.</p><p>Parents are valued as key partners in their child's learning and wellbeing. Their aspirations are central to decision making, monitoring and evaluating their child's learning and progress. Parents are well supported by members of the multi-disciplinary team to be confident parents and advocates for their children in the wider community. Parents build life-long friendships and support networks.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation are well established, comprehensive, effective and involve families and members of the multi-disciplinary team. Knowledge of the child from many perspectives is shared. Goals are clear, appropriate and well linked to comprehensive, specific learning programmes. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes is regular and ongoing and includes the child, family and members of the multi-disciplinary team. The combined depth of knowledge and skills ensures successful outcomes for all children.</p><p>Teachers are well supported in their professional learning and work effectively with children and families. Professional development is strongly focused on the needs of each child, the use of current research and other professionals across the education and health sectors. Teachers are competent, committed and enthusiastic about their work with children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and ERO agree that some governance and management systems need to be strengthened to ensure the ongoing effective operation of the service. These include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring internal evaluation processes are clearly documented, and recording the monitoring of action plans and outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthening strategic planning by clearly aligning the goals to the service's vision and philosophy priorities, regularly monitoring progress and evaluating outcomes for children</li>
<li>developing and implementing a robust, consistent appraisal process for registered teachers to ensure the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand requirements are met</li>
<li>continuing to build bicultural responsiveness in all aspects of the service's operations to clearly show the ways New Zealand's bicultural heritage is valued and included.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Southern Region</p><p>20 February 2019 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
