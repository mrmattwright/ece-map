</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids East Coast Bays in Browns Bay, provides education and care for up to 14 children from infants to school age. The centre is located in East Coast Bays Leisure Centre. Many of the families who use the facilities also use this service. They have the option of enrolling their children for two-hour sessions or full days. The centre is staffed by three qualified teachers, and one teachers’ assistant.</p><p>Teachers continue to provide the good quality practices noted in the 2013 ERO report. Since 2013 there have been staff and leadership changes and a new head teacher has been appointed. Teachers have engaged in professional learning and development to improve teaching practice. They have also furthered their understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori, improved the learning environment and installed shade-sails in outside playground.</p><p>Warm responsive relationships, inclusion and learning through play are key aspects of the centre’s philosophy which is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and includes an organisational belief that ‘active bodies have active minds’.</p><p>Kauri Kids East Coast Bays is one of ten early childhood centres that are owned by and operate within policies and framework of Auckland Council. The Auckland Council delegates management responsibility to the Childcare Services Manager. The centre’s head teacher works closely with a newly appointed curriculum manager, who visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four Kauri Kids reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in the centre are confident and articulate. They play cooperatively and with empathy for others. They approach adults and engage in conversation with ease and make good choices. Children engage in uninterrupted play. They are independent and choose their activities freely. Children are creative and imaginative and include literacy, mathematics and science as part of their play.</p><p>Teachers provide a stimulating and welcoming learning environment in a compact space. Children have a strong sense of belonging. Well resourced and interesting play areas support children’s engagement in play. Wall displays reflect teachers’ respect for New Zealand’s bicultural heritage and children’s family backgrounds. Children have fun as they explore and learn. Regular access to the centre’s facilities, including the gym and park areas provide extra opportunities for children to be physically active.</p><p>Respectful, responsive relationships between teachers, children and their families are a key feature of this centre. Teachers’ sensitive and supportive interactions extend children’s ideas and language in play and discussion. They are aware of children’s strengths and abilities and work in ways that respect children’s dignity. Teachers support each other and work well as a strong team. They share their knowledge and continually seek new ways of doing things.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement an inclusive, responsive curriculum based on children’s interests and strengths. The curriculum reflects <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the centre philosophy, and is becoming increasingly bicultural. Teachers have re-established planning systems and with support from the curriculum manager, continue to improve planning and assessment. Portfolios are good records of children’s involvement in the programme and show children’s strengths and interests.</p><p>Teachers are reflective, work collaboratively and benefit from the strong professional leadership of the head teacher. There is a culture of continuous improvement that is supported by research and professional development. The Auckland Council also provides leadership and professional development opportunities for teachers as well as administration and professional support.</p><p>Self review is established and becoming more focused on improving outcomes for children. There is a shared vision and clear direction guided by the strategic and annual plans. A rigorous appraisal system has been implemented that aligns to the strategic plan and teacher goals. Teachers’ appraisals identify appropriate professional learning needed to support their development.</p><p>The Auckland Council has good systems to guide centre management and governance, maintain ongoing improvement and ensure accountability. A robust system is in place to monitor health and safety practices and ensure all centres meet legislative requirements.  The Auckland Council has a strong commitment to implementing bicultural practices and responding to community needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation, using indicators of good practice</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the bicultural programme and responses to children’s languages and cultural identity</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the quality of teachers’ interactions with children and their whānau. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids East Coast Bays completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kauri Kids East Coast Bays will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
