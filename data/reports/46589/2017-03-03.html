</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rockmybaby Homebased is a licensed all-day, home-based education and care service located in Havelock North, Hawkes Bay. The network is licensed for 80 children between infancy and school age. Children are placed with one educator who can care for up to four children at any one time. At the time of this ERO evaluation most of the educators cared for children, in the children's homes.</p><p>This privately owned service was established in 2013 and is one of five networks under the same ownership operating throughout the North Island.</p><p>The quality of education in the network is overseen by a visiting teacher, who is supported by a senior visiting teacher and other professional leaders within the organisation.</p><p>The Rockmybaby philosophy makes a commitment to providing high quality education and care for each child, underpinned by kaupapa MƒÅori principles of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, ukaipotanga and wairuatanga.</p><p>This is the first ERO evaluation for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The values expressed in the philosophy underpins teachers' practice. The importance of learning through play and children developing a sense of belonging are evident.</p><p>Children participate in a programme based on their interests. Educators effectively notice, recognise and extend these interests by providing a wide range of learning experiences.</p><p>Educators are well supported by the visiting teachers to provide positive learning experiences for children. They actively model how to support relationships with children at home and other planned events. Visiting teachers provide useful resources to support educators' confidence in responding to children's learning.¬†</p><p>Regular visits are completed by the visiting teacher with a focus on building educators' understanding of, and capability for working with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Specific feedback supports the educator to provide a programme reflective of the child's interests. Managers and visiting teachers agree that continuing to support educators to identify the significant learning that is occurring for children remains a key focus.</p><p>Children benefit from positive relationships with educators. Regular, useful information is provided for parents about their child‚Äôs day through daily diaries and individual learning journeys. These are an attractive record of children's engagement in learning and development.</p><p>An online programme is an effective communication tool between educators and families, recording children's participation in learning. This is supporting parents to participate in decision making about aspects of the programme for their children. WhƒÅnau aspirations are interwoven into the curriculum.</p><p>Educators work in collaboration with parents to implement transition practices that nurture children's sense of belonging moving into and within the service and onto school.</p><p>There is a commitment to developing a bicultural curriculum within a home-based context. Documentation shows educators use of te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia with children.</p><p>MƒÅori learners' culture, language and identity are reflected in culturally responsive contexts for learning. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are integrated into the curriculum. All learners, parents and whƒÅnau have opportunities to contribute to programme planning. Plans to strengthen collaborative partnerships with local iwi should assist service leaders and educators to successfully support educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>Teamwork is well established. Emergent leadership among visiting teachers and where possible educators is encouraged and supported.</p><p>Many children in the service are infants and toddlers. The placement of educators is well considered and responsive to the needs of individual children and their families. The visiting teachers work positively alongside educators to provide a curriculum that effectively supports this age group.</p><p>Self-review processes that support educators to inquire more deeply into their practice are becoming established. Developing a more evaluative and systematic approach, that focuses on outcomes for children, should strengthen current practice. Managers recognise that deepening their understanding of review and internal evaluation processes is a next step.</p><p>Educators and families are kept well informed of the regular professional development opportunities provided. Improving the appraisal process has been ongoing. It is consistently implemented, identifies professional development needs and is aligned to the Practising Teacher Criteria. Induction processes for visiting teachers and educators are clearly outlined in supporting documents.¬†</p><p>Managers are quality and improvement-focused and have clearly defined systems and processes established to track operational expectations. Administration systems effectively support educators and visiting teachers in their roles.</p><p>The strategic plan effectively guides direction for the service. Goals are clearly linked to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and leaders have identified their next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>educators' understanding of assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rockmybaby Homebased Childcare Hawke's Bay completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rockmybaby Homebased Childcare Hawke's Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>3 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"></a></h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
