</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amana Christian Early Learning Centre is a small early learning service under the umbrella of the Taieri Christian Education Charitable trust. It is licensed for up to 35 children. The centre programme and practices are based on Christian values.</p><p>There have been significant changes within the centre since the 2013 ERO review, including a drop in the number of children attending. This has impacted on the financial sustainability of the centre. The centre is led by one of the trustees acting as manager and a head teacher. Teachers and parents work in a volunteer capacity taking responsibility for a range of duties. There have been a number of staff changes and the current team is newly formed. Teachers and the head teacher work hard to provide children with a teaching and learning programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>This centre is not well placed to sustain and improve outcomes for children. The service is not well governed and managed. Trustees have been working to address the ongoing financial issues for the service. The service has moved to mixed-age grouping as a way to reduce costs by employing fewer teachers. At the time of the review, trustees were not meeting the requirement of providing parents with written information about the amount and expenditure of funding received from the Ministry of Education.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers work hard to ensure the financial viability of the centre. This includes teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fundraising for equipment and resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>facing uncertainty in their hours of employment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accepting casual enrolments allowing children to attend for only one hour a week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing curriculum resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>funding much of their own professional development and resources to support teaching and learning in the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The significant governance and management issues, and the factors mentioned, above impact negatively on the teachers' ability to provide high quality teaching and learning programmes.</p><p>The service has identified priorities for its strategic direction. Currently the centre documents do not show how they plan to achieve, monitor and evaluate the goals. The owner needs to allow for sufficient funds to support the achievement of these goals.</p><p>Human resource management practices are not rigorous and at times do not meet requirements. For example:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>selection and appointment procedures have not been updated to meet requirements of the Vulnerable Children's Act and police vetting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>induction procedures give insufficient guidance to staff and volunteers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the head teacher and teachers are not well supported by the centre manager/trustees to enable continuous development of programmes and practices and conditions for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the roles and responsibilities of service leaders are unclear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the budget does not sufficiently allow for the full range of staffing costs, such as sick leave, teachers' professional learning and development, and curriculum resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Appraisal policies and practices need to be further developed to meet the Education Council requirements. This includes ensuring teachers have regular observations of their practice and curate evidence to show how they meet the Practicing Teacher Criteria.</p><p>The centre philosophy needs to be strengthened to show the service's commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. It should also more clearly identify the service&rsquo;s desired outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The centre management and teachers need external support to build understanding and knowledge of effective internal evaluation and use this to make improvements to the centre's operations and practices. The evaluation schedule needs to be refined to show coverage of all aspects of operation over time and ensure aspects that impact most on children are regularly evaluated.</p><p>Teachers have identified that they require professional support to improve processes for planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>The centre's policies and procedures need to be updated to reflect the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008 (as amended in May 2016) and other current legislation. When reviewing policies and procedures, trustees need to ensure that practices align with these and that the policy framework shows how it values and implements Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amana Christian Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children&rsquo;s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, GMA3, GMA4, GMA6, GMA7, GMA7a, GMA9, HS7, HS8, HS12, HS17, HS27, HS28, HS31.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Amana Christian Early Learning Centre. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amana Christian Early Learning Centre will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>17 February 2017&nbsp;</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.&nbsp;</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service&nbsp;</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
