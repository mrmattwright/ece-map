</table><p>Aoraki Explorers is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aoraki Explorers is located in the South Canterbury township of Timaru. The ownership of the service changed in 2017. Previously named Active Learners, the centre is one of nine early learning services in the Canterbury region, and one of 58 nationwide that are managed and operated by the Provincial Education Group.</p><p>In 2018 there was a restructure of the leadership of the centre, with some existing staff stepping up into leadership roles. Leaders within the centre are supported by a regional manager. Several staff have been at the centre for an extended period of time. Most of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em>, the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum, and the Reggio Emilia approach to learning. Teaching practice in the nursery area is influenced by RIE (Resources for Infant Educarers) and Pikler theories, with a focus on respectful interactions and freedom of movement.</p><p>The centre is divided into two distinct areas to cater for the specific needs of children aged 2 to 5, and for those under two years old. Families at the centre represent an increasingly diverse local community.</p><p>The centre is part of the South Timaru KƒÅhui Ako|Community of Learning which works collaboratively to support the teaching and the learning of all children in the local area from early childhood through to secondary school.</p><p>Centre leaders have made good progress with the areas identified for further improvement in the 2016 ERO report. This includes: refining the philosophy, promoting partnerships in learning with parents, strengthening strategic planning, internal evaluation and appraisal processes.</p><p>This is the centre's first review under the name, Aoraki Explorers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are actively involved in a range of interesting experiences that promote physical activity, creative play and oral language development. Project based learning is supported by the inquiry approach which extends children's questioning and reasoning skills.</p><p>Leaders and teachers foster respectful, reciprocal relationships across the centre. They promote a sense of belonging for children, parents and whƒÅnau. The cultures and languages of families are respected and celebrated. Parents' wishes for their children are valued and used to inform planning for individual children and groups. Parents are regularly informed about their children‚Äôs learning through a range of established communication methods, including well-written learning records.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the individual interests, strengths and capabilities of children. They work closely with parents and specialist agencies to support and enhance the learning of children with identified needs.</p><p>Teachers are increasing their understandings of te ao MƒÅori perspectives across all aspects of the curriculum. This enables them to provide meaningful bicultural experiences for children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from consistent caregiving that promotes secure relationships and a positive sense of wellbeing. Children benefit from calm, unhurried interactions that are sensitive to their changing needs and preferences. Infants and toddlers have easy access to an environment that inspires their curiosity and exploration.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a strong commitment to continuous improvement that is focused on positive outcomes for children. Leaders value and make good use of teachers' passions and skills. Emergent leadership amongst teachers is encouraged and well supported to build capability and service-wide capacity. There is a systematic approach to reflective practice, appraisal and internal evaluation that is aligned to strategic priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine strategic planning to capture key priorities, and set indicators and intended outcomes that can be monitored and evaluated</li>
<li>extend knowledge and use of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em></li>
<li>continue to strengthen consistent use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices across the service.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aoraki Explorers completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>19 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
