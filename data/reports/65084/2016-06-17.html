</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Learners Early Childhood Centre in Timaru is a privately owned education-and-care centre. The owners have a second centre in the Christchurch region and are in the planning stages for opening a third centre. The centre provides full-day care and education for up to 57 children from birth to six years of age. A centre manager oversees the daily operations of this centre.</p><p>Up to 12 infants are cared for in a separate area by three qualified teachers. Children from two to six years play and learn together in a spacious indoor area. A team of five qualified teachers plan and provide programmes based around children's ages and interests. There is an additional room called the Wharenui, where small groups of children and teachers can work on extended projects or enjoy movement and music sessions.</p><p>This is the second ERO report for this centre. The owners, manager and teachers have made very good progress towards making the improvements recommended in the 2013 report, particularly in the areas of planning, assessment and evaluation, and teacher practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owners have a strong vision for children and their families. They aim to 'provide high quality care and education that supports children and their whƒÅnau to develop the skills, knowledge and values so they can actively and positively contribute to a changing world.' Under their direction, the manager and teachers provide programmes that are based on the philosophies of Reggio Emilia and Pikler. Key aspects of these programmes are the careful preparation of the indoor and outdoor areas to provide interest and promote curiosity and the evident culture of respect.</p><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging to the centre. They play well together and confidently make choices about what they want to do and where they want to play during the day. They enjoy trusting relationships with their teachers.</p><p>Transitions into and throughout the centre are well planned so that children feel secure during this time. Teachers have had ongoing professional development to enrich the way they work with children. As a result they now:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>know about and use a greater range of strategies to extend children's thinking and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have consistent routines which support a sense of order, independence and a calm atmosphere for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers make parents feel very welcome and have many ways to keep them informed about centre life. For example, they share news and information about what children are learning through regular newsletters, formal and informal meetings, parent education evenings and social media.</p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of interesting experiences. Teachers use children's interests as the starting point to extend their learning. Aspects of the programme that support children's learning include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>early literacy and mathematics integrated into their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a focus on healthy eating and being physically active</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many opportunities for exploration and creative and dramatic play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of ICT to investigate and research ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visitors to the centre and excursions into the local community.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from a programme which acknowledges New Zealand's bicultural and increasingly multicultural heritage. The teachers have had extensive professional development to help them better respond to the language, culture and identity of children and their families, in particular MƒÅori and Pacific. Children of all ages:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>hear and use some te reo MƒÅori and waiata</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn their mihi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are supported by their teachers to develop more in-depth knowledge of MƒÅori and Pacific perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The next step is for teachers to more consistently show in children's records how they acknowledge and respond to the language culture and identity of children and their families.</p><p>Children aged under two benefit from respectful, caring relationships with their teachers. Teachers provide a programme where care moments are an opportunity for learning. Teachers use these times to pay close attention to children's verbal and non-verbal cues. They maintain an unhurried pace and have arranged the area for children to move freely and explore. Teachers have thought carefully about what they want children to learn. The philosophy is detailed and outlines some of the important ideas guiding the programme. When the philosophy is next reviewed, teachers should state these ideas more simply and make the desired learning outcomes for children clearer. The philosophy should also be used to guide internal evaluation.</p><p>There is an effective system for planning for individuals and groups of children. Teachers seek parents‚Äô wishes for their children‚Äôs learning. In the best examples, children's records show how parents and teachers have worked together to support the child‚Äôs learning. The next step is to make this more consistently evident in all children's profiles.</p><p>There is a new centre manager since the last ERO review. With the support of the owners she has had a strong focus on building teacher capability within the team, including developing her own leadership abilities. The team works well together. Leaders and teachers have a continuous focus on improving their programmes and practices.</p><p>A new appraisal system encourages teachers to think deeply about their work and set ongoing improvement goals. There is potential to develop this system further by ensuring all teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include a shared appraisal goal linked to the priorities in the strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their understanding of TƒÅtaiako, teachers' cultural competencies, and how these align to the practising teacher criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some staff have had recent professional development to build the understanding and practice of internal evaluation. The manager has identified the need to plan for the development of this so all staff have a good understanding and can lead internal evaluations. Internal evaluation practice can still be strengthened by ensuring a more evaluative question focuses the investigation. Well-developed indicators need to guide the evaluation at all stages.</p><p>The owners are very supportive of the manager and her team. They have high expectations and provide support for teachers to grow and improve their practice. There is a draft strategic plan to guide the direction of the centre over the next three years. As the owners and manager continue to develop the draft strategic plan they should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the goals are strategic rather than everyday business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the actions are sufficiently comprehensive and specific</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the manager's reports to the owners align to key aspects of the plan and are evaluative.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is potential to align MƒÅori values with current values stated in the strategic plan.</p><p>The owners have developed useful systems to support the smooth running of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the owners, manager and teachers are to refine:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan and align systems to the plan to enable progress towards the vision and goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the consistency of children's records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aspects of appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Learners Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Active Learners Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
