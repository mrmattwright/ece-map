</table><p>BestStart Manukau 2¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Manukau 2 provides both sessional and full-day education and care for up to 50 children over the age of two years. It is one of two licensed centres that operate on the same site. The adjacent centre, Manukau 1, provides full-day education and care for children from three months to five years. Both centres are managed by one centre manager. The same administrative and management systems serve the two centres.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart charitable trust. The organisation has re-branded all its early learning services. BestStart provides an overarching governance and management framework to support operations and curriculum delivery in individual centres. Business Managers (BM) and Professional Services Managers (PSM) facilitate staff professional development and provide strategic guidance.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, bicultural practices and partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau. The centre philosophy is based on the belief that children learn best through professional, responsive and respectful relationships. Cultural diversity is valued and <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> is acknowledged.</p><p>A new centre manager was appointed in 2017. She is establishing shared understandings about effective teaching and learning practices. Recently, a new head teacher was appointed. She oversees the management of curriculum and mentors staff in the centre.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted that children benefitted from trusting relationships with adults, and the ethnically diverse teachers reflected the children's backgrounds. Teachers provided support for children who spoke languages other than English. These features remain. The centre manager has strengthened evaluation so that teachers are more critically reflective, and improvement focused.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the BestStart Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children respond positively to the warm and welcoming environment. Teachers engage children in respectful and responsive conversations to help them connect to their centre experience. Children enjoy their friendships and play cooperatively with their peers. Teachers encourage parents to be part of their children's play and learning.</p><p>Children play in a spacious environment underpinned by literacy and numeracy. The environment offers a variety of learning opportunities that children can use to extend their play. Teachers provide a curriculum that incorporates the children's interests and develops their learning dispositions.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are developing learning partnerships with families to enable teachers to know children and families well. Teachers use both digital and paper form portfolios to record children's individual development. They continually strive to strengthen communication with parents/whƒÅnau.</p><p>Teachers engage in conversations with children as they play to build on language development. They provide opportunities to promote oral language and support their learning.</p><p>Children know the routines of the centre. They confidently engage in the day's programme and know what is expected of them. The centre works closely with agencies and parents to best support children with additional needs.</p><p>Good links are being established with local schools to ensure a seamless transition to school through regular visits and meetings. Parents are well informed, so children can feel confident transitioning to their new school.</p><p>Teachers use <span lang="mi">waiata, karakia</span> and <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori</span> with children during the programme. Visual displays reflect and enhance the bicultural curriculum. The centre values children's cultures through cultural performances, sharing food and celebrations as important aspects of the centre life. Teachers and centre staff play an important part in these celebrations. Parents/whƒÅnau are actively involved in cultural events.</p><p>Good systems for internal evaluation guide and inform teaching and learning, which results in improved practices to promote positive outcomes for children. Professional learning and development focused on building teachers' capability. This has impacted positively on teaching practices.</p><p>National, regional and centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans, and a shared vision which monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promote a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and support more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Professional learning and development have a focus for building capabilities and has impacted positively on teaching practices. The service provides opportunities for emergent leadership within the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that key next steps include continuing to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teaching practices by using reflective and collaborative evaluation to follow up from curriculum planning and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the consistency of learning stories and individual assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' understanding of early childhood teaching practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Agreed next steps for the organisation are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural understanding and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk analysis management systems, processes and procedures for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes to support teachers‚Äô continuum of professional knowledge and practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Manukau 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</p><p>8 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
