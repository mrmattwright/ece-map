</table><p><span>Casa dei Bambini Foundation School¬†<span>is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Casa dei Bambini Foundation School is a Montessori early childhood service in Christchurch. This full day service is licensed to educate and care for up to 27 children aged from 2 to school age. The day is split into two sessions, with older children attending in the morning or for the whole day, and younger children starting in the afternoon session.</p><p>Casa Dei Bambini Foundation School is governed by the Casa dei Bambini Educational Trust. The centre manager works closely with the head teacher. The stable, experienced staff are all qualified Montessori teachers and almost all are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The philosophy of the service focuses on the holistic learning and wellbeing of children through a Montessori curriculum which is underpinned by Te WhƒÅriki Early Childhood Curriculum. The environment is presented in a way that encourages children to be risk takers. The philosophy also focuses on quality, respectful interactions between children and adults and the importance of family in promoting a child‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and work in respectful partnerships with other learners and teachers. They learn in an orderly and well-resourced environment with high-quality Montessori equipment purposefully presented to encourage children's curiosity.</p><p>The child centred and led curriculum has a strong focus on literacy, numeracy and science. These areas are integrated into the curriculum in ways that are meaningful to children‚Äôs learning. Teachers engage in purposeful conversations with children to extend their oral language, thinking and problem solving skills.</p><p>Children are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves and to care for others and the environment. Leaders and teachers know children well. They identify and are responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and capabilities.</p><p>The transition of children into, within and beyond the centre is well supported by personalised practices and processes. Children with specific learning needs benefit from an inclusive learning environment and planning that includes intentional teaching, differentiated programmes and access to external support.</p><p>Parents' aspirations are sought, acknowledged, valued and used to guide teaching and learning. The service promotes effective partnerships with parents to support children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning. Parents are kept informed of their children‚Äôs learning and participation in the learning programme through well written learning records and informative displays.</p><p>The efficient management and governance structure supports the effective operation of the service. There is a clear alignment of the service's philosophy, curriculum, internal evaluation, strategic goals, appraisal and professional development. A well thought out strategic plan prioritises actions within the centre. Ongoing monitoring and evaluating of progress towards strategic goals would help with determining next steps for improvement and evaluating the impact of planning on outcomes for children.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is strongly evident in practice. Teachers model the philosophy through care and respect for one another and families. There is a focus on continuous improvement and high-quality outcomes for children. This is supported by a systematic approach to collaborative, evidence-based internal evaluation focused on service priorities and improved outcomes for teaching and learning.</p><p>Strong leadership of the centre supports positive outcomes for children and continuous improvement. Teachers are encouraged to grow their teaching capability through reflective practice and professional development that is responsive to their needs and relates to the goals and priorities of the centre.</p><p>The service has made progress towards meeting the recommendation in the October 2016 ERO report. Appraisal is embedded and confidently used to improve teaching and learning. Teachers are beginning to use te reo and tikanga MƒÅori as part of their daily routines. The centre has identified that a next step in this area is to further develop culturally responsive pedagogies. ERO recommends that this should include consultation with whƒÅnau and iwi and professional development of staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service has identified and ERO agrees that a key next step to improve outcomes for children is to extend leaders' and teachers' understanding of culturally responsive practices by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consulting with whƒÅnau and iwi to ensure authentic partnerships are developed and maintained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing ongoing targeted PLD opportunities for teachers and leaders to continue to strengthen understanding and use of culturally responsive practices and competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen bicultural perspectives by increasing children‚Äôs language, culture and identity in their learning records.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Casa dei Bambini Foundation School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p><span>Southern Region - Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
