</table><p>Lollipops Napier Port¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>There is uncertainty about the service's capability and capacity to sustain and improve its performance.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Napier Port, previously known as Lollipops Educare Napier, is a privately-owned service licensed to provide education and care for 100 children, including 25 up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO evaluation, there were 101 children on the roll, including seven who are MƒÅori. Separate learning spaces provide for the needs of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>The service is one of seven in the Hawkes Bay governed by Evolve Education Group (Evolve). A manager is responsible for quality assurance and professional learning and an acting area manager provides support to the centre manager and teaching team. Eleven teachers have an early childhood qualification. Four staff have full certification, five are provisionally certificated and two are subject to confirmation. Several educators are untrained.</p><p>The service's philosophy, reviewed in 2018, reflects the values and beliefs of teachers, families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The April 2016 ERO report identified the need to develop a shared understanding of internal evaluation and to strengthen te ao MƒÅori in curriculum and assessment practices. Improvement of the appraisal system was also needed. Significant staffing changes at Evolve and the centre have impacted on the rate and sufficiency of progress in responding to these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two centre reviews in Evolve.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a range of child-initiated, play-based experiences for the majority of their time at the centre. Teachers select and introduce a variety of learning opportunities as part of group programme planning. E-profiles are records of learners‚Äô participation and enjoyment in activities of choice. Observations of children in everyday activities are beginning to build a picture of how teachers notice, recognise and respond to learners' interests and ideas. Teachers should continue to seek support and guidance to build their capability in assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Infants are encouraged to become active communicators and explorers. Programme provision for these very young learners focuses on nurturing their wellbeing through responsive caregiving. Adults play and work alongside children to support their developing skills.</p><p>The centre manager is focused on growing staff understanding of bicultural practice. Te reo MƒÅori is heard throughout the daily programme. Teachers continue to consider ways to further develop their capacity to respond to MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Professional leadership requires strengthening. Through training, the manager has developed her knowledge of internal evaluation for improvement. Strengthening the teaching team's understanding of how evaluation contributes to high quality practice and outcomes for children is key next step for development.</p><p>The revised appraisal process provides a sound framework to support teachers to develop their practice. Most teachers are new to the service and a full cycle of appraisal had not been completed. Appraisal was an area for improvement in the previous ERO report. This needs to be addressed to support teachers‚Äô growth and to meet requirements of the Teaching Council.</p><p>The centre's 2019 action plan identifies some useful priorities and goals. There is an emphasis on growing curriculum leadership to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. Further alignment of the action, strategic and annual plans is needed to support the manager and teachers to show progress towards meeting these goals and achievement of the Evolve vision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Evolve should increase its support to teachers and leaders to improve their understanding of and practices in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership capability in a deliberate, systematic manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation, to know the impact of teachers‚Äô practices on children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve must also ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all appointments are consistent with the revised appointments process and with the requirements of the Children's Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any and all records related to serious incidents, complaints and reporting to relevant external agencies, if required, are made available on request to relevant agencies.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Napier Port completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety practices and governance management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>any and all records related to serious incidents, complaints and reporting to relevant external agencies, if required, are made available on request to relevant agencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appointments are consistent with the revised appointments process and consistent with the requirements of the Children's Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a designated space is available to support the provision of restful sleep for children under the age of two at any time they are attending. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS4, GMA7, GMA7a, PF37].</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite stage of the review, the service has provided ERO with steps taken to address the need for:</p><ul>
<li>the appointment process to be consistent with the requirements of the Children's Act 2014</li>
<li>a designated space being made available to support the provision of restful sleep for children under the age of two at any time they are attending.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>10 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
