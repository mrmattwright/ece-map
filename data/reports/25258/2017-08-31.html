</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.¬†</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Church Street Childcare Centre provides full-day education and care for up to 90 children including a maximum of 12 under two years old. The centre comprises of three separate buildings that cater for infants, toddlers and young children. These groups also have designated outdoor areas. Most children have MƒÅori or Pacific heritage and there are smaller numbers of Indian and Asian children. The centre aspires to a philosophy of children being 'capable and competent architects of their own learning'.</p><p>The service is governed by the Cariad Charitable Trust and is one of three centres managed by Royal Oak Childcare Centres Ltd. An overall manager and a mentoring leader guide centre operations. Two team leaders are responsible for guiding staff to implement programmes for children. There are eight registered teachers and two unqualified staff. The staff team reflects the diversity of the centre community.</p><p>All teachers are supported to participate in a professional development course that focuses on respectful relationships and provision for children's uninterrupted play. Teachers are currently focused on further developing curriculum practices.</p><p>In 2013 ERO reported many positive features of the service including the quality of the learning environment and children's ability to sustain their play. Trusting relationships and teachers' readiness to extend learning underpinned programmes. Teachers were working to improve their self review and bicultural practices. In 2017 changes in staffing, programme expectations and the centre community have resulted in a deterioration in the quality of outcomes for children.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>As a result of professional development initiatives teachers have moved away from traditionally arranged early childhood environments to more minimalist settings. They focus on providing natural materials, abstract items and prolonged periods of uninterrupted play. Teachers in the toddlers' and young children's areas often take an observation role rather than a facilitation role in children's learning. This approach is currently not effective in fostering positive outcomes for children.</p><p>While teachers are respectful and caring towards children they are not sufficiently responsive to behaviours that frequently disrupt play and at times harm others. Children's energy is not being channelled productively.¬†</p><p>The area for children under two years old is a calm supportive environment. Babies are nurtured by gentle teachers who sing to them and encourage them to explore resources. Very young toddlers thrive in this more traditional environment and benefit from shared play in the sandpit and outdoor playground. Babies show a sense of wellbeing in this respectful setting.</p><p>The process for planning programmes is generally sound and works well for infants. However, teachers working with the older groups do not always recognise the reality of children's behaviour and learning capabilities. Plans tend to be aspirational and learning stories focus on potential, rather than actual learning. Teachers need to critically reflect on how to engage children in meaningful learning for more than brief periods. Ideas they could explore include:</p><ul>
<li>re-establishing more traditional resources and play areas, and considering how well the programme reflects <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>rearranging the young children's environment to support more settled behaviours</li>
<li>strengthening the focus on language development, especially for toddlers</li>
<li>putting some structure in the day and fostering a sense of responsibility in children</li>
<li>actively engaging with children in interesting play and in reading stories.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, leaders and teachers must continue to encourage parents and whƒÅnau involvement so that efforts to improve children's behaviour are supported at home.</p><p>The centre leaders are experienced and strive to achieve good quality education and care for children. They provide an appropriate management framework and have established meaningful self review. The leaders recognise that some documentation should be updated and they are currently improving the appraisal process. A review of the philosophy to more explicitly include a commitment to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and Te Tiriti o Waitangi could provide sound direction for staff.</p><p>The trust provides generously for the community and staff.¬† There are minimal costs to parents and whƒÅnau and an extensive budget for staff professional development. It is timely for trustees to reflect on how more benefit can be gained from these considerable inputs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>revising the strategic plan to develop better implementation processes</li>
<li>updating centre policies and documenting a curriculum policy to clearly define expectations</li>
<li>strengthening teachers' capacity to become critically evaluative about their teaching practices</li>
<li>strategically evaluating the overall programme to examine how well teaching practices match children's capabilities and interests, and the extent to which they are culturally relevant.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Church Street Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>providing a language-rich environment that supports children's learning¬†</li>
<li>providing a range of experiences and opportunities to enhance and extend children's learning and development¬†</li>
<li>providing a curriculum that supports children's developing social competence and understanding of appropriate behaviour</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C8,9,10; Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 43</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Church Street Childcare will be within two years.¬†</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>31 August 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
