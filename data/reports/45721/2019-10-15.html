</table><p>Clinton Little Oaks Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clinton Little Oaks Learning Centre is a small, rural, privately-owned early childhood centre. It is an all-day education and care service licensed for up to 25 children with ten up to two years of age. The owner/manager is a provisionally registered teacher and teaches in the programme along with two qualified teachers. Due to decreasing numbers of children up to two years of age attending, changes have been made to the operation of the service. The centre is now mixed age where children of all ages play and learn alongside each other. Children up to two years of age may attend up to three days a week.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims to provide a home-like environment where children and their families are always welcome. The core value is for children, teachers and families to work together to form warm, nurturing, respectful and reciprocal relationships. Teachers believe children should have access to the local community and natural world to enhance their learning.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO report the owner/manager and teachers have made good progress on maintaining and building effective assessment and planning for children's learning. They have continued to make improvements to most key next steps. However, teacher appraisal is still an area that requires more work.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review, the owner/manager had planning underway to disestablish the service and was working with the South Otago Kindergarten Association to re-establish an early childhood service on another site within the township.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a strong sense of belonging within the centre and wider community. Their wellbeing and learning are nurtured in an inclusive and positive environment. They are highly engaged in their play and learning. They have opportunities to make choices, and learn about caring for themselves, others and the environment. Teachers respectfully listen to children and give them time to explore their own thinking, be inquisitive, problem solve and experiment. They carefully nurture children's social skills and help them to make friends. Children learn some te reo MƒÅori and me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori is promoted.</p><p>The curriculum effectively promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers know the children well and meet regularly to plan interesting programmes that respond to and extend on their interests and strengths. A next step for teachers is to evaluate the effectiveness of the planned strategies and experiences in promoting children's learning. Assessment records show teachers responding to parent's wishes for their children's learning, language, culture and identity. Teachers should now show how they personalise the learning outcomes based on <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, for the children at the service.</p><p>Teachers deliberately resource and arrange the environments to reflect the children's prior experiences and stimulate their interest. Flexible routines help children to develop self-help and independence skills. Teachers make good use of parents and the community to provide rich learning experiences for children. Cultural celebrations, family events and regular excursions into the neighbourhood and beyond are well integrated within the curriculum. Children are able to take risks and experience physical challenges.</p><p>Literacy, mathematical and science concepts are very well integrated across the curriculum and through a range of play-based and teacher initiated activities and experiences. Teachers provide many opportunities for children to lead their own learning and have recently improved transitions to school.</p><p>Teachers ensure there is frequent reciprocal communication and information sharing with parents about the care and education of children up to two years of age. Caregiving practices are responsive and aspects of the programmes are adapted to cater for younger children. Consideration should be given to ensuring there are sufficient spaces available for children who are not yet mobile and those learning to crawl and walk.</p><p>The centre owner/manager makes good use of external agencies to help children who may need additional learning support.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used to make improvements to programmes and teaching practice. Teachers need to further develop their understanding and use of effective internal evaluation, and ensure the scheduled reviews have a focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>Managers need to provide an effective system to ensure all teachers regularly appraised.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre manager/owner and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explore and personalise the learning outcomes in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> as part of planning, assessment and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and experiences in promoting children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen understanding of internal evaluation and further develop the schedule to ensure that all aspects of operation are reviewed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement an effective appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clinton Little Oaks Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage are secured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service's emergency plan is annually reviewed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system for regular appraisal is in place and implemented.</p>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development.

Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
