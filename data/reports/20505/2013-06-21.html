<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Just Kidd Inn Too, in Glen Eden, Auckland, caters for children from birth until they enrol at school. The centre is one of three early childhood centres owned and operated by the licensee. Centre staff maintain positive relationships with family, wh&#257;nau and aiga. The centre has a history of positive ERO reports and ERO&rsquo;s recommendations have formed a basis for centre development.</p><p>Centre self-review systems have continued to improve and have been used by staff to evaluate programmes, resources and teaching practice in an ongoing manner. Teachers are dedicated to strengthening the bicultural aspects of programmes and teaching practice.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>In accord with the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of developing learning in a natural setting, children have a variety of opportunities to explore and to develop understandings about the environment and the wider world. They confidently make choices about the direction of their play and use resources creatively to support their learning.</p><p>Children interact positively with each other and their teachers. They engage in sustained play and have good opportunities to explore their learning environments. Teachers know children well and respond thoughtfully to their contributions and interests. Children respond positively to the calm, unhurried pace of the programme. They confidently seek help and reassurance from teachers when they see this as necessary. Infants and toddlers experience warm, caring interactions with adults. Teachers manage care routines well and in consultation with parents.</p><p>Some good examples of teachers extending children&rsquo;s complex play are evident. These good models of sustained, complex and extended play could provide a basis for developing greater consistency in the overall quality of teaching and learning practice.</p><p>Teachers provide physical challenges for children through a variety of outdoor equipment. A recent development of the outdoor area was guided by parent, child and staff ideas about what might be included. The result has been a successful transformation of a learning environment that reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of children learning best through interacting with natural materials.</p><p>Well considered programme planning responds to children&rsquo;s interests. Planning and assessment is closely aligned to <em>Te Wha&#772;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and is informed by current early childhood education theories.</p><p>The centre owner is an experienced professional leader who provides teachers with opportunities for leadership. She supports them with well considered professional development, and helps to develop a culture of reflective practice in the centre. Well considered management systems empower all staff to be active participants in self-review processes. These collaborative approaches contribute to strong centre direction and self review that has a positive impact on outcomes for children. Recent professional development has focused on enhancing teachers&rsquo; management of children&rsquo;s behaviour. The centre manager and owner report that this training has resulted in enhanced adult/child relationships and has supported the implementation of the centre&rsquo;s &lsquo;natural phenomena&rsquo; philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers have identified the following next steps to build on successful centre practices:</p><ul>
<li>teachers identifying in learning records how children&rsquo;s thinking and understandings are extended</li>
<li>centre managers and teachers strengthening learning partnerships with parents</li>
<li>teachers exploring ways to promote greater success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Kidd Inn Too Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
