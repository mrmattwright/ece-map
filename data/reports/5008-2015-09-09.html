</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ruawai Kindergarten provides six hour sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two years. The kindergarten operates in a purpose-built, modern facility adjacent to the local primary school in rural Ruawai. Children play together in a mixed-age group.</p><p>Many children attending the Kindergarten identify as NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, with a smaller number from MƒÅori backgrounds. Most of the children‚Äôs families are from the surrounding agricultural areas.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs 2012 ERO report identified positive aspects of the programme, including the skilled integration of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, into the programme. It also highlighted developing relationships with families. ERO recommended that teachers should strengthen evaluation systems to identify the impact of teaching on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides governance, leadership and policy frameworks to meet operational and management expectations. Association personnel assist teachers to maintain good standards of health and safety and to improve the quality of educational programmes. The Association‚Äôs <em>P≈´manawatanga</em> Plan reflects a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and support for the development of bicultural practices across the organisation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs move to the new site has been a revitalising force for children and teachers. The centre is spacious, and the outdoor area is providing new opportunities for children‚Äôs play. Teachers continue to plan for further good use of the playground, with a stronger focus on environmental sustainability and respect for nature. Many examples of child voice and children‚Äôs creative work are displayed to indicate the value teachers‚Äô place on children‚Äôs ideas and thinking.</p><p>Children choose and guide their own play. They talk enthusiastically with friends and adults and are respectful and careful of others‚Äô feelings. Tuakana/teina relationships are visible. Teachers use strategies from professional learning to support children to play together respectfully. These positive strategies are allowing children to develop sound self-management skills.</p><p>Teachers provide good quality education and care for children. From their first positive transitions into the kindergarten, teachers strive to give children a sense of belonging, wellbeing and confidence. As a result of these careful transitions, children and their families appear self assured and happy. Teachers record useful information about individual children‚Äôs learning while at kindergarten. This information can be used as children move to school.</p><p>Children enjoy the kindergarten's plentiful resources and play in ways familiar to their home lives. Teachers work close to children, supporting their play when necessary and engaging them in conversation. Teachers recognise and use children‚Äôs interests as a starting point for planning programmes. They could now consider ways of increasing children‚Äôs learning based on what they already know by broadening the scope of learning programmes.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to hear and use te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers‚Äô have a significant and visible commitment to te ao MƒÅori (the MƒÅori world). They promote it in ways that are meaningful to children, their parents and themselves. They also support children‚Äôs knowledge and understanding of waiata, mihi whakatau and karakia. Children clearly demonstrate their familiarity with the language and protocols, sometimes using te reo MƒÅori in their games. Teachers have benefitted from the support provided by Association personnel and have expressed their intent to continue this development.</p><p>Teachers invite parents/whƒÅnau to discuss their aspirations for their children and to contribute to programmes. This is encouraging a sense of ownership and inclusion for families.</p><p>The Northland Kindergarten Association provides effective governance for kindergartens. Its long-term direction focuses on making decisions to improve learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>good support and guidance by Association personnel to improve the quality of kindergarten programmes and teaching practice, particularly the development of bicultural practices and integration of <em>Te Ao MƒÅori</em> into programmes in ways meaningful for children</li>
<li>effective teacher appraisal and professional learning and development that contributes to improved teacher skills, knowledge and practice, especially in supporting children‚Äôs social competence, and strengthening the quality of assessment documentation</li>
<li>significant investment in property and environment upgrades to promote children‚Äôs exploration and investigation</li>
<li>a focus on distributed leadership practices amongst kindergarten teaching teams to utilise teachers‚Äô individual and collective strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Association leaders are considering ways to enhance teacher appraisal and self review processes. ERO recommends that the Association strengthens systems to ensure that all health and safety requirements are being implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on existing good practices ERO suggested, and teachers agree, that they could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop portfolios to reflect children‚Äôs progress over time in terms of their learning dispositions and thinking</li>
<li>strengthen connections with the MƒÅori community</li>
<li>improve self review to guide environment changes, curriculum content and teaching practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ruawai Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ruawai Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
