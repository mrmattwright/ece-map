</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Peek-A-Boo In Home Childcare is a private, home-based education and care service operating in Palmerston North. It is licensed for 80 children, including 80 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review, 41 children were enrolled and two identify as Māori.</p><p>The owner manages the service and also undertakes the role of visiting teacher, supporting in-home educators to provide care and learning programmes for children. One other part-time, visiting teacher is also employed.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of children learning through play in safe, inclusive and nurturing environments where risk taking, problem solving and exploration are encouraged. The development of trusting reciprocal relationships with caregivers is considered integral to learning.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for Peek-A-Boo In Home Childcare which began operation in 2014.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have opportunities to participate in a wide range of social learning experiences. Many attend playgroups and organised trips, gymnasium and music sessions, as well as benefitting from the experiences planned by their educators.</p><p>In-home programmes are suitably responsive to children's emerging interests, needs and ideas. The owner and visiting teacher work hard to remove barriers to children’s participation in the service. They are aware of local agencies and resources to assist those who need additional support. Commitment to a culturally responsive approach is evident. A recent review has supported the development of resources and practices to improve understanding of the range of cultures in the local community.</p><p>The teaching team expresses commitment to strengthening the bicultural perspective in the programme. Key operational documents that outline expectations for acknowledgement of te ao Māori in the service need further development. Connections with the local Māori community and access to relevant Ministry of Education resources should help with developing this approach.</p><p>Educators' understanding of high quality practice for infants and toddlers is enhanced through planned and ongoing development opportunities. Journal records show that the needs of these children are carefully identified and responded to. Communication with parents is purposeful and well developed.</p><p>Educators are well supported by visiting teachers to notice, recognise and respond to children's developing interests and dispositions. Significant happenings are regularly documented in learning journals for children to revisit and share with parents. A stronger focus on building educators' capability in assessment for learning should be put in place. The teaching team has identified that more work is needed to promote parents' partnership in planning for learning and also in responding to the aspirations they have for their children's participation in the service.</p><p>Suitable guidelines support consistent understanding of expectations for roles and responsibilities at visiting teacher and educator levels. A range of regular professional development is provided to support the planning of suitable play-based learning experiences. Documentation for educators includes good examples of ways to analyse and respond to children’s learning, and information about the values of play.</p><p>Children’s transitions into and out of the service are carefully considered. Care is taken to match families with educators when children enrol. A 2016 review of the service's approach to supporting transition to school, has resulted in improved understanding of best practice, the development of resources and useful, up-to-date information for parents and educators. The owner agrees that a next step should be to continue to build relationships with local schools, to facilitate enhanced sharing of information about individual children and school and early childhood programmes.</p><p>The development of responsive and reciprocal relationships with parents is considered a priority by the owner. Teachers' visit notes are shared with parents and regular contact is made about children's learning programmes. Families' views are always sought as part of practice and operational reviews. Regular newsletters provide a variety of information about learning and events. Computer technology is used well to support timely communication of news and views.</p><p>The owner has a highly organised and collaborative approach to managing day-to-day operation, and teaching and learning. Teamwork is well developed. A professional, improvement-focused culture characterised by support and care for others is evident.</p><p>Review and reflection is embedded in practice at all levels and used well to support decision making about improvement. A suitable process for self review linked to key aspects of practice, is in place. The inclusion of an evaluative question to support each review should better focus the process on internal evaluation. Measurement of the impact of changes made over time and alignment with strategic priorities should also become part of this approach.</p><p>A performance development process is in place for the visiting teachers. To improve the approach, goals should be better articulated and linked to outcomes for children, progress towards goals actively monitored and supported by a range of evidence. The visiting teachers should be able to show how the evidence they have collected meets requirements for renewal of their Practising Teacher Certificates. The appraisal process for the owner needs to include goals and actions linked to her development as leader of the service.</p><p>Governance and management roles and responsibilities need to be further clarified and documented to ensure key tasks are identified and operation remains sustainable. The development of a strategic plan outlining long-term priorities is a next step, to better define direction for this service. A systematic approach to monitoring progress should support decision making. While good documentation and checking systems have been developed to provide assurance of educators' compliance with legislative requirements in their homes, the owner agrees that a systematic process implemented at management level would add further rigour to quality assurance.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the owner and visiting teacher agree that next development steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support for educators' approach to planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process for visiting teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quality assurance at management level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development of the leadership role at the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems to support a sustained approach to governance and management.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peek-A-Boo In Home Childcare completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Peek-A-Boo In Home Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
