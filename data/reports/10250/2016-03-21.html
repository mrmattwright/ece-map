</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Centre is situated in Kamara Road, Glen Eden, Auckland. The centre provides education and care for children from two to five years of age, who come from a diverse range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. There are eight children of MƒÅori descent enrolled and seven children from Pasifika cultures. The centre is licensed for 30 children.</p><p>This centre is one of four in Auckland owned and operated by CTA Enterprise Ltd, a private family-owned company. The service provider governs the centre and provides overall financial management. A group manager is employed to provide professional leadership, and support and guidance for the centre leader in all aspects of centre operation.</p><p>The learning environment has many unique features. Grounds are spacious and gardens are carefully tended by staff, families and children. This outdoor area provides a wonderful place for play and learning in a natural environment.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, there has been considerable positive development in the centre. A new centre leader has been appointed and she is now well established in this position and is working effectively with a stable teaching team. In 2015, management employed an external consultant to provide professional learning and development for teachers about assessment, planning and evaluation. This work is having a significant and positive effect on teaching and assessment practice, leading to improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The group manager, in her role as professional leader has strengthened self review processes. The centre leader is implementing this model with her teachers and the programme philosophy has been recently reviewed by the teaching team. This philosophy articulates a child-centred programme where children learn through play. A strong focus on developing and maintaining respectful and caring relationships has enabled teachers to successfully establish partnerships for learning with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and was one of three CTA Enterprise Ltd centres reviewed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are welcomed into a responsive, well-organised and attractive environment. Their diverse cultural backgrounds are highly valued by teachers. Parents and other family members are encouraged to become involved, and share their language and cultural practices. This approach has made the curriculum very relevant for children, and has led to the development of a rich and inclusive place for education and care.</p><p>The group manager has developed a respectful working partnership with the centre leader. A recent shift in strategic planning practice has resulted in centre leaders prioritising areas for development with their teams. This approach is leading to a strong sense of ownership and a clear vision for centre improvement amongst staff. Management recognises the importance of providing ongoing professional development for leaders in the area of strategic planning and self review.</p><p>The centre leader, with ongoing professional support from the group manager, is providing effective leadership for the centre. This contributes to positive outcomes for children. Her highly collaborative style of leadership is appreciated by staff. She values and utilises their diverse skills and backgrounds and this enriches the programme and environment that the centre provides. There are many opportunities for teachers to contribute to decision making in the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The high level of cooperation amongst teachers, and their willingness to reflect on and improve their practice is highly evident. The recently reviewed philosophy is well understood and is being carefully enacted in the programme. Teachers are given many opportunities to discuss, reflect on and share best practice for learning and teaching. They have responded to professional learning about assessment, planning and evaluation and implemented new practices to enhance learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers place emphasis on the individual development of each child using the Individual Pathway Planning (IPPs). They are focussing more closely on children's individual stages of development and planning intentional learning experiences, most likely to meet the child's needs and interests. A strength of this approach is the 'multiple voices' of all teachers and parents that contribute to the planning and assessment for each child.</p><p>Children are able to make choices about their learning and are encouraged to challenge themselves and solve problems. Teachers engage in rich and interesting conversations with them to extend their thinking. They model appropriate language in meaningful contexts, which is very relevant for the many children for whom English is a second language. Teachers are skilled at recognising opportunities to develop children's early literacy and mathematical concepts during play.</p><p>The centre curriculum is child-led with teachers preparing the environment to invite participation and learning through play. Learning about science and the natural world is a particular strength. Children regularly use technology to research their ideas and extend on their interests. Teachers are continually seeking ways to ensure that the programme reflects, promotes and fosters the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children along with their parents, are well supported to make a successful transition to school. Similarly, priority is placed on assisting children and their families to transition with ease into the centre, and to quickly feel included in the centre community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>During the review, the ERO team discussed development and progress with managers and the centre leader, and agreed that the following priority areas for continuing development are to:</p><p>review and refine the performance management systems, including the appraisal process for leaders and teachers. Particular emphasis should be placed on developing and documenting a procedural framework that is clearly linked to practising teacher criteria</p><p>enhance and consolidate teacher capability through inquiry, as part of the centre self-review process. These teacher-led inquiries should be informed by current theory and research in best assessment and teaching practice, and be aligned with the appraisal process</p><p>In addition, management should continue to work with an external provider to develop strategic and systematic self-review systems that focus on all aspects of the services' operation over time and which informs strategic planning. Particular attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>regular review of specific areas of the curriculum</li>
<li>teacher cultural competencies and the use of te reo MƒÅori</li>
<li>provision for children with special needs and abilities, including English Language Learners and children with identified strengths.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>21 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
