</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Upper Hutt Kindergarten is situated on Savage Park Reserve in close proximity to the centre of Upper Hutt city. It is licensed for children aged two years and over. It has an all-day licence for 40 children in the mornings five days per week where older children attend, and 30 children in the afternoon three days per week where younger children attend. The majority of children move to five main local schools that surround the kindergarten.</p><p>The teaching team is long standing. The head teacher is a strong leader. They have responded well to the May 2010 ERO report. Developments made over the three years are highly evident. In consultation with parents and wh&#257;nau they reviewed their philosophy. This is clear in practice.</p><p>The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association) coordinates the Upper Hutt Professional Learning Community (UPLC) cluster. This focuses on teachers from both the early childhood and primary sectors regularly meeting to support positive transitions to school for children. Upper Hutt Kindergarten is part of this cluster.</p><p>The association governs the kindergarten effectively, and provides senior teacher support. The association is committed to maintaining 100% of teachers being qualified. Clear policy guidelines outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operations.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm, welcoming and respectful. They know their children, parents and wh&#257;nau well. They work effectively to seek the aspirations of parents and wh&#257;nau and are purposeful in the way these contributions are used. The well-established partnerships, children&rsquo;s interests and the professional knowledge of teachers all contribute well to the design of the curriculum. Because of this, children have ample opportunities to enjoy successful learning. Teachers regularly use self review to make changes to the programme.</p><p>Numeracy and literacy are effectively integrated in the programme. Information and communications technologies (ICT) are used well by teachers to support children&rsquo;s learning. They encourage children to think, problem solve, articulate their ideas and make links to their home experiences. This is achieved effectively though use of a wide range of teaching strategies. Children are busy in their play and enjoy engaging for long periods of time, both independently and in groups of their choosing.</p><p>Assessment and planning relates directly and well to the changing aspirations of parents and wh&#257;nau, for their children. Portfolios clearly show children&rsquo;s development and learning over time, how teachers plan to support, encourage and extend children&rsquo;s learning, and how children have been successful in achieving these goals.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs and those with English as a second language are well supported. Teachers use external agencies where appropriate and plan to support each child to achieve success. This is done is partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau. Teachers encourage children who speak another language to share their expertise in the kindergarten.</p><p>Te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and appropriate tikanga practices are valued and used, mainly within routines. Teachers identify that these practices should be more integrated throughout the day. They have worked to develop plans that identify a range of strategies that teachers will include in the programme for M&#257;ori and Pacific learners. These plans focus on using the good partnerships established with families, and the bicultural programme to promote success for children. Once the strategies have been implemented teachers should measure the impact they have had on teaching and learning.</p><p>Transition to school information is readily available for children, parents and wh&#257;nau. Teachers work closely with local schools through the UPLC cluster and through developed relationships with schools. Regular visits to some local schools occur and teachers are working on further improvements for children to gain a wider perspective of school life.</p><p>The head teacher works collaboratively to provide ongoing support and guidance for teachers. Teachers are provided with opportunities to lead and use their strengths and skills to support the programme. Children are provided with many opportunities to take on leadership roles.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well-targeted, ongoing support and guidance for staff. They promote regular professional development opportunities and useful systems that are focused on positive outcomes for children. The recently implemented performance appraisal process has the potential to enhance teacher practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop shared understandings with M&#257;ori and Pacific families for success for Maori, as Maori and success for Pacific. This should help teachers to measure the effectiveness of their own practice for these priorities.</li>
<li>add an evaluative focus to self review and use the next steps teachers are identifying through the current review process, as measurable indicators. This should assist teachers to enquire into their own practice and judge the effectiveness of their operations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Upper Hutt Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Upper Hutt Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>1 November 2013<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif"></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
