<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Auckland Girls Grammar School Childcare is located in the grounds of Auckland Girls Grammar School in central Auckland. The school principal is the licensee and reports to the board of trustees on centre operations. Children are very well cared for in the centre. Teachers provide a welcoming, family atmosphere where children are valued as individuals.</p><p align="left">A respect for children as competent, capable learners is apparent through the child-centred programme and teachers&rsquo; interactions with children. Children respond enthusiastically to the many opportunities to engage in their choice of group or individual play. Many are confident communicators, sharing their ideas with other children and adults around them. Teachers skilfully use these interactions as opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning. Teachers are continuing to develop the recording of each child&rsquo;s developmental journey through portfolios of learning.</p><p align="left">The programme develops as teachers follow children&rsquo;s lead and support them to develop the complexity of their play and scope of their learning. Music is a feature of the programme. High levels of interaction among children, one-to-one focused attention by adults, and prolonged conversations support children's language development and foster thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Staff work reflectively and collaboratively to contribute to ongoing improvements to centre operations. They provide a very effective programme that is responsive to children's strengths, needs and interests. Respectful teamwork and a strong commitment to the consideration of children&rsquo;s perspectives help promote a very positive learning environment for children.</p><p align="left">Self-review processes are well developed and consultative practices with parents and staff ensure ongoing improvement to the quality of the service. Teachers have open, responsive relationships with parents and are keen to include parents in their children&rsquo;s learning and development at the centre. Parents who were interviewed expressed a high level of satisfaction with the centre and confidence in staff to care for their children.</p><p align="left">This report finds that centre management and staff, being highly collaborative and reflective, are well placed to continue providing children with a sound foundation for learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Auckland Girls Grammar School Childcare was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAuckland Girls Grammar School Childcare.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2007 ERO report recommended that teachers participate in an externally facilitated assessment programme based on the Ministry of Education resource Kei Tua o Te Pai. Four teachers currently employed undertook this professional development in 2008. Teachers report that the resources from this initiative are still valued by staff as they review their assessment practices.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><em>Relationships.</em> Trusting, meaningful relationships between adults and children are a positive feature of this centre. Teachers actively model inclusive and cooperative interactions. Staff show genuine interest in, and respect for, individual children and are knowledgeable about children&rsquo;s preferences and backgrounds. These inclusive practices help to foster in children a strong sense of security and belonging in the centre.</p><p align="left"><em>Facilitating learning.</em> Teachers are skilful facilitators of learning, who respond purposefully to children&rsquo;s interests, actively foster curiosity and enthusiasm for learning and support children to extend their thinking. Children learn to solve problems independently and collaboratively with their peers, persist with tasks and help to make decisions about programme development. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are characterised by careful listening and conversations that extend children&rsquo;s understanding and awareness of their world.</p><p align="left"><em>Learning environment.</em> The atmosphere is one of enthusiastic, purposeful engagement with learning. Centre developments to the environment and buildings have helped to provide an effective learning environment for children. A good range of equipment and resources is readily available for children to select from. Teachers use equipment and the outdoor environment flexibility to provide stimulating areas for imaginative play and physical activity.</p><p align="left"><em>Younger children.</em> Infants and toddlers receive nurturing, attentive care. They develop confidence and independence as they explore with interest the multilevel environment and accessible resources. Teachers affirm and extend children&rsquo;s communication efforts helping to foster language development. Toddlers often play and interact with older children, further enhancing their language, thinking and physical development.</p><p align="left"><em>Self review.</em> Teachers work together as a professional and supportive team. Their ongoing reflection on the effectiveness of teaching strategies and the programme contribute to teachers&rsquo; very good knowledge of children&rsquo;s learning and to the focused nature of their work with children. The programme for children, and teachers&rsquo; roles in facilitating learning, are continually refined as a result of this reflection.</p><p align="left"><em>Programme management.</em> The teaching team work collaboratively and reflectively to ensure that the programme and environment caters for individual children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Programme planning is now displayed to show the evolving nature of children's interests. These documents give parents very good information about children&rsquo;s learning experiences, illustrate the observation and reflection of teachers and show programme development and progression. Portfolios include learning stories that recognise and affirm children's abilities and their developing interests.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">ERO endorses the following areas for development identified by centre managers. The teaching team will continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop their reflections of the daily programme in order to share emergent learning with parents; and</li>
<li>develop meaningful documentation of children&rsquo;s learning progress.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO also recommends that teachers offer more opportunities for children to investigate and experiment with science equipment to foster their sense of curiosity about the world around them.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">There are currently 8 children identified as M&#257;ori enrolled in the centre. Centre managers acknowledge the importance of identifying and responding to the aspirations of parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children. Recognition of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is an integral part of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. This is reflected in teachers&rsquo; recognition of the individual learner and in their commitment to continuing partnerships with wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><em>Respectful relationships.</em> Respectful relationships that teachers build with children and parents, including M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau, are a feature of this centre. Inclusive dialogue and shared understandings assist staff and parents to find strategies to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left"><em>Te reo M&#257;ori.</em> The centre reflects teachers&rsquo; understanding of and commitment to tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori. Teachers include te reo naturally and easily in their conversations and waiata.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Auckland Girls Grammar School Childcare completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>23 February 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-auckland-girls-grammar-school-childcare" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Auckland Girls Grammar School Childcare</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Auckland Girls Grammar School Childcare.</p><p align="left">Auckland Girls Grammar School Childcare is located in the grounds of Auckland Girls Grammar School in central Auckland. The school principal is the licensee and reports to the board of trustees on centre operations. Children are very well cared for in the centre. Teachers provide a welcoming, family atmosphere where children are valued as individuals.</p><p align="left">A respect for children as competent, capable learners is apparent through the child-centred programme and teachers&rsquo; interactions with children. Children respond enthusiastically to the many opportunities to engage in their choice of group or individual play. Many are confident communicators, sharing their ideas with other children and adults around them. Teachers skilfully use these interactions as opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning. Teachers are continuing to develop the recording of each child&rsquo;s developmental journey through portfolios of learning.</p><p align="left">The programme develops as teachers follow children&rsquo;s lead and support them to develop the complexity of their play and scope of their learning. Music is a feature of the programme. High levels of interaction among children, one-to-one focused attention by adults, and prolonged conversations support children's language development and foster thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Staff work reflectively and collaboratively to contribute to ongoing improvements to centre operations. They provide a very effective programme that is responsive to children's strengths, needs and interests. Respectful teamwork and a strong commitment to the consideration of children&rsquo;s perspectives help promote a very positive learning environment for children.</p><p align="left">Self-review processes are well developed and consultative practices with parents and staff ensure ongoing improvement to the quality of the service. Teachers have open, responsive relationships with parents and are keen to include parents in their children&rsquo;s learning and development at the centre. Parents who were interviewed expressed a high level of satisfaction with the centre and confidence in staff to care for their children.</p><p align="left">This report finds that centre management and staff, being highly collaborative and reflective, are well placed to continue providing children with a sound foundation for learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
