</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sathya Sai Preschool - Rongomai is a privately owned and operated service that offers a free education and care service for children and their families. The centre is owned by 'The Sathya Sai Values Education &amp; Services Trust (NZ)'. It operates under the principles and human values of right conduct, peace, truth, love and non-violence. The centre is located in the grounds of Rongomai School in Otara, Auckland, and caters for up to 40 children over two years of age.</p><p>The Trust is represented on site by the centre‚Äôs long-serving licensee/signatory. The licensee models the values of the organisation and is responsible for ensuring that they are followed. She is committed to community involvement and empowerment. She appoints local people and encourages them to extend their work experiences and qualifications over time.</p><p>Previous ERO reports have highlighted special strengths in the centre. The reports have especially noted the advantages for children of positive relationships, good levels of adult interactions and worthwhile learning activities. The centre has maintained these strengths over time and has continued to develop and progress in other areas. The appointment of a new supervisor is providing additional impetus for ongoing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a programme that reflects the centre‚Äôs values. They share warm and trusting relationships with adults and each other within an affirming and caring environment. Children have teachers who know them and their families well, and who are intent on promoting their overall wellbeing. They settle well into their preschool day and actively contribute to maintaining the centre‚Äôs attractive and orderly environment. Children are positive and happy, and confident in their interactions with adults.</p><p>The centre welcomes diversity. It reflects New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural society and the bicultural nature of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children‚Äôs cultural identities are well promoted by the centre‚Äôs multi-cultural staff, its programme and environment, and the high levels of engagement it has with parents and whƒÅnau. The centre works closely with families needing support and caters well for children with special needs. It genuinely reflects the licensee‚Äôs passionate belief in community and the value of education.</p><p>The programme is a combination of free choice from available indoor activities, participation in centre routines such as 'circle times', and self selected play in the outdoors. Children have rich opportunities to explore available indoor activities in depth. Teachers place a strong focus on oral language development and appropriately integrated literacy and mathematics learning experiences during these times. Older children demonstrate high levels of interest in the more formal aspects of the programme, but these aspects are not so appropriate for the younger children currently attending.</p><p>The curriculum is very well led. The supervisor promotes a programme that is increasingly responsive to children‚Äôs emergent interests. Records of children‚Äôs learning are developing well, and parental input into recognising this learning has been significantly extended. Strong self-review processes are now the basis of curriculum improvement. Teachers are reflective about their practice and undertake increasingly robust programme evaluations. Teachers participate in good quality appraisal processes and benefit from the skill and expertise of their curriculum leader.</p><p>The Trust governs the centre well. The licensee is also a trustee and is often in the centre. She values her staff and is intent on being a good employer. She has ensured that the centre operates under appropriate and well documented policy and procedure. She has considerable knowledge and experience, and demonstrates a strong commitment to her beliefs and the underlying purpose of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>During the review ERO, the licensee and the supervisor discussed the advantages of:</p><ul>
<li>adapting the formal aspects of the programme to better meet the needs of the younger children</li>
<li>resourcing the outdoors and providing teachers with professional development that helps them provide more challenge for, and extension of, children‚Äôs learning and curiosity</li>
<li>resourcing other areas of play more richly to support deeper and more intensive childinitiated creative and imaginary play</li>
<li>featuring child-initiated play more often in records of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>formalising succession processes to support the licensee now and to ensure continuation of her good practices in the future.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sathya Sai Preschool - Rongomai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sathya Sai Preschool - Rongomai will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
