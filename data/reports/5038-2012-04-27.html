<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Bucklands Beach Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. In 2010, the kindergarten changed from its traditional model of separate morning and afternoon sessions. It now employs four qualified teachers who provide six-hour days for up to 30 children, and morning sessions for an additional ten children.</p>
<p align="left">The teaching team has managed change well and continues to reflect on ways to be responsive to the needs of children and the increasingly diverse community. Teachers&rsquo; focus on building and sustaining positive relationships with children and their families is a strength in the kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers create an environment that supports and optimises learning. ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report commented on the high quality of resources, and good use of the spacious outdoor area. Community contributions feature in the environment, which offers varied, interesting and attractively presented spaces that invite exploration.</p>
<p align="left">Facilitating child initiated play is a priority for teachers. Children are confident and capable, and work together well to develop their play ideas. They remain engaged in self-directed activities, particularly imaginative role play, for long periods. There are high levels of interaction amongst children. Meaningful conversation with teachers helps children to become skilled communicators and supports children for whom English is an additional language.</p>
<p align="left">ERO supports teachers&rsquo; goals to make children&rsquo;s learning more visible for parents and children and to consider different ways of approaching programme documentation. Improvements should increase the extent to which assessment and planning records show teachers&rsquo; good knowledge of children and the richness of the programme.</p>
<p align="left">The Association&rsquo;s processes for monitoring and reviewing kindergarten operations are well established and continually refined. Teachers continue to develop their self-review practices. They have identified appropriate strategic priorities and areas for further development. Continual improvement through rigorous self review will help teachers to achieve these goals.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Bucklands Beach Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBucklands Beach Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review two new teachers have been employed. The team of four qualified teachers is supported by a part-time unqualified teacher and a new part-time administrator. A building upgrade has significantly improved work space for teachers as well as expanding the inside play area.</p>
<p align="left">The change to a Kindergarten Day Model (KDM) has reduced the number of children able to attend. The roll has dropped from 78 children in 2009 to the 54 currently enrolled.</p>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review commented on a variety of positive aspects of kindergarten programmes. ERO suggested improving planning and assessment and increasing cultural inclusiveness and the use of te reo M&#257;ori. Teachers continue to make improvements in these areas.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Curriculum design. Teachers&rsquo; statement of teaching and learning and the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy statement clearly express the priorities in their curriculum design, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>reciprocal relationships with children, their families and the community</li>
<li>a well resourced and carefully presented environment for learning</li>
<li>flexibility and responsiveness in facilitating meaningful, child-led learning</li>
<li>valuing each child&rsquo;s individuality and cultural heritage</li>
<li>incorporating bicultural practices.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum is based on Te Wh&#257;riki, the NZ early childhood curriculum, teachers&rsquo; ongoing professional development and their understanding of best practice in early childhood education.</p>
<p align="left">Relationships and community. A welcoming, settled atmosphere and inclusive, trusting relationships between children, parents and teachers are positive features of the kindergarten. Teachers make good links between children&rsquo;s homes and the kindergarten, and increasingly with local schools and other members of the community.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have reflected on how they meet the needs of families with diverse cultural backgrounds. They have taken steps to incorporate aspects of these cultures and languages in the environment and mat times.</p>
<p align="left">Engagement in learning. Teachers facilitate programmes that are focused on child-led activities and responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas. They engage in meaningful conversations that extend children&rsquo;s communication skills. Effective strategies are used to promote literacy learning and to foster children&rsquo;s independent thinking, problem solving and negotiation skills. Children work together cooperatively and continue self-directed activities for long periods.</p>
<p align="left">Environment. Children have ready access to the resources that adults make available to them in thoughtfully presented, uncluttered play areas. They make very good use of the inviting outdoor spaces that offer physical challenge and variety. Teachers regularly review the layout and presentation of play areas in response to current programme topics and children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p>
<p align="left">Developing reflective practice. Teachers continue to build their capacity and skills as a collaborative and cohesive team. Their increasingly reflective practice is evident in performance appraisal records, staff meeting minutes and recent review documents. Reflection often leads to in-depth discussion about strategies to improve provision for children.</p>
<p align="left">Recent reviews have included the impact and effectiveness of the KDM and the quality of assessment portfolios. As a result of ongoing review, teachers report that they have improved and continue to adapt their assessment, planning and evaluation processes.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Programme documentation. Through self review, the association&rsquo;s professional services manager and the teachers have identified the benefits of further improving assessment and planning records. Programme documentation could:</p>
<ul>
<li>make more explicit the ways in which programmes are planned in response to parents&rsquo; input and teachers&rsquo; knowledge of children&rsquo;s individual strengths and interests</li>
<li>reflect the quality of the programme to a greater extent</li>
<li>show progression of learning and how children&rsquo;s particular interests evolve over time</li>
<li>more frequently identify the wider learning outcomes for children and their developing dispositions for learning.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Records of teachers&rsquo; programme evaluation could also more clearly show how critical reflection on their role as teachers contributes to enriched learning programmes for children.</p>
<p align="left">Annual and long term planning. The association is currently reviewing and introducing new processes for strategic planning. ERO and association personnel agree that the kindergarten could formalise long-term planning so that it informs each year&rsquo;s plan. Refining strategic and annual planning would help the association and teachers to monitor progress towards strategic goals.</p>
<p align="left">Further developments. Teachers are also currently working to increase:</p>
<p align="left">their confidence and skill with te reo M&#257;ori, and to integrate bicultural practices more naturally throughout programmes, rather than being largely confined to mat times</p>
<p align="left">the extent to which children&rsquo;s home languages and cultures are visible in the environment and in their individual assessment records</p>
<p align="left">ERO supports these positive developments.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Bucklands Beach Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2>
<p align="left">ERO, the kindergarten teachers and managers agree that teachers should continue to increase the extent to which their documentation reflects, and supports further development in, the quality of teaching and learning in the kindergarten.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-bucklands-beach-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Bucklands Beach Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Bucklands Beach Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Bucklands Beach Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. In 2010, the kindergarten changed from its traditional model of separate morning and afternoon sessions. It now employs four qualified teachers who provide six-hour days for up to 30 children, and morning sessions for an additional ten children.</p>
<p align="left">The teaching team has managed change well and continues to reflect on ways to be responsive to the needs of children and the increasingly diverse community. Teachers&rsquo; focus on building and sustaining positive relationships with children and their families is a strength in the kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers create an environment that supports and optimises learning. ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report commented on the high quality of resources, and good use of the spacious outdoor area. Community contributions feature in the environment, which offers varied, interesting and attractively presented spaces that invite exploration.</p>
<p align="left">Facilitating child initiated play is a priority for teachers. Children are confident and capable, and work together well to develop their play ideas. They remain engaged in self-directed activities, particularly imaginative role play, for long periods. There are high levels of interaction amongst children. Meaningful conversation with teachers helps children to become skilled communicators and supports children for whom English is an additional language.</p>
<p align="left">ERO supports teachers&rsquo; goals to make children&rsquo;s learning more visible for parents and children and to consider different ways of approaching programme documentation. Improvements should increase the extent to which assessment and planning records show teachers&rsquo; good knowledge of children and the richness of the programme.</p>
<p align="left">The Association&rsquo;s processes for monitoring and reviewing kindergarten operations are well established and continually refined. Teachers continue to develop their self-review practices. They have identified appropriate strategic priorities and areas for further development. Continual improvement through rigorous self review will help teachers to achieve these goals.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.&nbsp;</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
