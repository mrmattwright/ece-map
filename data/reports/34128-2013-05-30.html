<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A supplementary review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Kids to Five Green governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the February 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>personnel policies which promote quality practices, including staff appraisal and professional development for both management and educators</li>
<li>the programme provided for children and how teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the organisation of the premises, equipment and materials in the centre so it is safe for adults and children, and particularly those aged under two.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five Green previously known as Lizzies Early Childhood Centre was purchased by Kidicorp Limited in October 2012. Kidicorp Limited is a privately owned umbrella organisation operating a large number of centres throughout New Zealand.</p><p>The ERO review of 2012 was carried out when the service was operating under previous management. This review report identified concerns around the quality of education and care provided by the service, outlined in the terms of reference of this report. Since the change of ownership substantial progress has been made to the quality of management, leadership, and the quality of education. This progress and development is contributing positively to teaching practices and outcomes for children.</p><p>Since October 2012 there have been changes to centre management and staff. ERO has not identified any further areas for improvement, than those that the professional service manager and centre manager have identified through self review processes as areas for ongoing improvement. They have developed robust systems and processes to monitor and continually improve centre operations.</p><p>The centre has purchased a van for the purpose of children in the community having the opportunity to participate in early childhood education. The centre manager and teachers have established professional working relationships with other agencies to support children and their families.</p><p>The teaching team have established a shared vision that aims to embrace practice and respect of others values, cultures and traditions through positive and responsive relationships and interactions with children and their families.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The newly appointed centre manager with the support of an experienced professional services manager, has successfully set high expectations for practice. They are actively supporting staff. An action plan has been developed and is being monitored for ongoing improvements.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in the following areas. Staff appraisal processes are now in place. There are effective guidelines, procedures and practices that identify ongoing staff personal and professional development goals. These goals are monitored and continually reviewed and refined. There are clear links to the Kidicorp Limited strategic plan, the centre&rsquo;s self review and documentation.</p><p>Teachers have taken part in a variety of relevant internal and external professional development. This is contributing to improved teacher professional knowledge and practice. Other examples of professional support being offered include opportunities for teachers to network with other colleagues within the organisation, and coaching and mentoring.</p><p>Staff have developed a shared vision through rewriting the centre philosophy. This is having a positive impact on the culture of the centre. A robust process of self review is being used to facilitate improvements in assessment, planning and teacher practice. Features of this are a commitment to including a bicultural focus and strengthening partnerships with families/wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; ongoing professional development is resulting in considerable improvement in the quality of interactions to foster children&rsquo;s learning. All of the planned initiatives support the improvement to the quality of education and care for children.</p><p>Significant finances have been used to upgrade resources and enhance the environment. The environment now includes a safe area for babies with appropriate resources and teacher support for care and learning experiences.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the key next steps for ongoing development are to:</p><ul>
<li>embed the newly implemented performance management system</li>
<li>continue providing relevant staff professional development</li>
<li>continue building staff capacity through regular reflection time, self review and the development of a shared leadership approach.</li>
</ul><p>Management has plans in place to continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>outdoor spaces</li>
<li>building upgrades</li>
<li>continued purchase of equipment that supports and extends children&rsquo;s interests and strengths.</li>
</ul><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>30 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
