<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is becoming increasingly well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kids Klub Childcare Centre provides an education and care service for up to 20 children. The centre occupies a modified house in a residential area in Glenfield, Auckland. The current owner has managed the centre for 12 years. ERO&rsquo;s reviews in 2009 and 2006 commented on the welcoming and friendly atmosphere of the centre.</p><p>The centre provides a family-like environment for children of mixed ages. There are three fully registered teachers, including the supervisor and the owner. They provide good leadership for the six other staff, many of whom are working towards early childhood qualifications.</p><p>Parents/wh&#257;nau value the service. They are invited to share their children&rsquo;s interests and cultural backgrounds. The centre also implements a treaty of Waitangi policy and consults wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children. As a result, staff know children and their families well. Children&rsquo;s progress and development is well documented and celebrated.</p><p>The centre is due to be relicensed by the Ministry of Education in 2013.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides a calm and settled environment for children. Caring and respectful relationships between adults and children nurture children&rsquo;s learning and development. Routines are kept to a minimum so that children&rsquo;s play is not interrupted. Teachers are observant of children and share information about their progress with parents and each other.</p><p>Children benefit from the varied and well resourced programme. They can access and select equipment to initiate and sustain their own play. Staff respond to children&rsquo;s ideas and interests. Children enjoy positive relationships with the staff and with one another. Teachers support children&rsquo;s activities and extend their play through conversation and questioning.</p><p>Other strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for reading and experimenting with writing</li>
<li>outdoor climbing equipment that children can set up in different and imaginative ways</li>
<li>access to indoor and outdoor resources that encourage physically active play</li>
<li>interesting materials for painting, drawing and construction that prompt creative play.</li>
</ul><p>Children make friends and develop good social skills. They play confidently both independently and in small groups. Staff assist children to resolve differences and to express their ideas and feelings verbally. As a result, children are happy and busy throughout the day and are actively engaged in the programme. Children&rsquo;s learning is well documented and their work is valued and displayed.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; planning relates to children&rsquo;s interests in meaningful ways and is increasingly child centred. Children and parents are also encouraged to contribute ideas and suggestions about the centre programme. The mixed-age programme works effectively. Babies and toddlers are well cared for by staff and older children. They have appropriate activities designed to engage and interest them. Four-year-old children also have special activities and a programme that prepares them well for their transition to school.</p><p>Teacher professional development has focused on responding to children rather than directing their play. Centre leaders encourage staff to reflect on their practice and consider ways of improving the environment and outcomes for children. The newly implemented teacher appraisal system is usefully designed to incorporate teacher reflections and to provide professional feedback.</p><p>Planned self review is assisting staff to make ongoing improvements in the centre. Teachers evaluate aspects of the programme in ongoing ways. Centre leaders value ideas that impact positively on children&rsquo;s learning and progress. A key focus identified by centre leaders is continuing to improve the quality of interactions so that children become more capable and independent learners.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre managers seek suitable professional development that will support and assist them to:</p><ul>
<li>refine programme planning procedures</li>
<li>develop a framework for planned self review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kids Klub Childcare Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The licensee has agreed to update and improve policies and procedures for:</p><ul>
<li>documenting risk analysis and management for excursions outside the centre</li>
<li>reporting and responding to suspected child abuse.</li>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
