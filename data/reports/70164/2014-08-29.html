</table><p>The Tiddlywinks Preschool directors are still in the process of developing effective management systems. Further support is needed to build their capacity to establish useful and systematic management practices and procedures.</p><p>The directors and teachers are working to create a curriculum that is responsive to all children‚Äôs cultures and languages. They are in the early stages of developing their understanding and use of bicultural practices to support MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau. These areas for development were identified in the November 2011 ERO report.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tiddlywinks is a small, privately-owned centre catering for infants and toddlers and children up to school age. There are separate indoor and outdoor spaces for children under two years of age. These spaces allow younger children to observe the older children‚Äôs play areas.</p><p>The centre owners are qualified early childhood teachers and are a regular part of the teaching team. The other teaching staff is made up of a mixture of registered early childhood teachers and teachers in training. There have been some changes in staff since the November 2011 ERO report.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy places a strong emphasis on providing children with opportunities to have fun while learning within a natural environment.</p><p>The directors and teachers have begun to address the recommendations from the November 2011 ERO report. These include changes to the way children‚Äôs learning is assessed, extending the self review processes and bicultural resources. The directors have also defined leadership roles and responsibilities. Further improvements are needed to enhance learning, teaching and assessment documentation for all children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, caring and nurturing relationships. Teachers know children and their families well.</p><p>Teachers have relaxed and respectful conversations with children. They involve them in meaningful discussions to reinforce their confidence and problem solving. Interactions with children are positive and respectful. Younger children are well supported to develop self-help skills and independence. Teachers are responsive to younger children‚Äôs non-verbal communication and focus on strengthening their language development.</p><p>Children relate well with each other and with their teachers. ERO observed children engaged in imaginative play for extended periods of time.</p><p>Teachers actively participate in children‚Äôs play, follow their lead and encourage them to explore their emerging interests. They provide children with a wide range of easily accessible resources to encourage their curiosity and creativity.</p><p>Children and their families are well supported as children move into and within the centre. Transitions are flexible to meet individual needs. Children who are ready to enrol at school are also provided with helpful information.</p><p>Teachers are collaborative and supportive of each other. They have shared values and beliefs that reflect the philosophy and are evident in their dealings with children. Teachers are provided with regular and relevant professional development that reinforces positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The teaching team and directors have developed an effective process for long-term self review. They regularly reflect on positive practices and what could be improved. This useful process should now be extended to include short-term reviews. The directors should also think about the best ways to include the opinions of parents and children as part of these reviews.</p><p>The directors are extending leadership capacity by providing greater opportunities amongst teaching staff to share roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre directors agree that planning for and assessing children‚Äôs learning needs to be strengthened. Teachers need to consistently:</p><ul>
<li>identify the specific learning that is happening for individual children and what their next steps are</li>
<li>specify the role of the teacher and what they will do to support children‚Äôs future learning</li>
<li>consider the best ways to include parent and child views about learning</li>
<li>reflect children‚Äôs home cultures and languages.</li>
</ul><p>The directors need to develop ways to formally monitor the quality and consistency of learning stories. They also need to consider how to usefully document how children‚Äôs emerging interests are being met. This should include regularly sharing the planned programme with parents.</p><p>The directors and teachers have identified that greater emphasis needs to be given to increasing te reo and tikanga MƒÅori within the programme.</p><p>The directors have established a useful process for appraising teachers. However, this process should include more robust and formal feedback for teachers about how they can extend their teaching practices. The directors have not yet been appraised<em>. [Action 1]</em></p><p>The centre‚Äôs strategic plan could be strengthened to include:</p><ul>
<li>specific priorities for each year</li>
<li>indicators for success</li>
<li>clearer roles, responsibilities and timeframes</li>
<li>opinions from parents.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tiddlywinks Preschool Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the review ERO identified a number of compliance practices and procedures that needed to be improved. This included some policies that needed to be updated and signed and removing some minor earthquake hazards. Since the onsite stage of the review many of these compliance matters have been addressed.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management practices. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>Suitable human resources and management practices need to be implemented, including regular appraisal of the directors.¬†<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tiddlywinks Preschool Ltd will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>29 August 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
