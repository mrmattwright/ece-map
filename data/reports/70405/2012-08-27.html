<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Children at ABC Merivale enjoy very good relationships with their teachers and one another. They play and learn in a homely renovated villa. The managers and teachers at ABC Merivale are well placed to promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The ABC Merivale provides full day and sessional programmes for children aged from birth to five years. Families from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds attend the centre.</p><p>At the end of 2011, there was a change of ownership for ABC Merivale and the wider ABC group across New Zealand. The centre is now owned by Kidicorp and branded ABC. The new owners have made changes to policy, procedures and reporting; this has been an ongoing learning process for all staff.</p><p>The centre is preparing to complete some indoor and outdoor renovations in response to the 2010/2011 Canterbury Earthquakes and to meet new licensing requirements by 2014.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children benefit from positive and caring relationships with their teachers. The children are confident, and have an expectation that adults will listen to and engage with them. They play well with and alongside others for sustained periods of time. Many of the children have strong friendships with one another. Teachers sensitively support children and their families through transitions into and within the centre programmes.</p><p>Teachers have calm, respectful interactions with children. ERO observed teachers listening well to children. Teachers have conversations that promote children&rsquo;s independence and extend their thinking and their oral language skills. Many children know their own learning strengths. Teachers praise children for their efforts and often give them feedback about their learning.</p><p>The programme is structured to promote children&rsquo;s choice and independence. For example, older children can choose when they have morning tea. Other aspects of the programme that support children&rsquo;s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>a good range of learning experiences that stem from their interests and teacher priorities</li>
<li>regular opportunities to increase their understandings of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>enjoyable and interactive group times, appropriate to their interests and needs.</li>
</ul><p>The well-being of Infants and toddlers is well attended to. Teachers are responsive to their individual needs and preferences. Teachers effectively meet the learning requirements of infants and toddlers through the provision of good quality interactions and appropriate resourcing.</p><p>As a result of ongoing professional development, the teachers have worked successfully together to develop a model for planning their group and individual programmes. Teachers actively encourage parent involvement and participation in the programme. Parents are well informed about children interests and centre priorities through attractive and useful wall displays and regular newsletters. They have many opportunities to contribute to their children&rsquo;s special achievement journals. Parent views are valued and actively sought to inform the future direction of the centre.</p><p>The centre managers provide strong leadership and direction to the team. Emergent leadership is fostered. The teachers work very well as a team. The managers and teachers are developing a shared understanding of self-review processes. They are making good use of reflective practices and spontaneous review to support and improve aspects of the programme and teaching practices. The centre has a sound operational framework. Systems to ensure health and safety are well managed.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next steps to further improve positive outcomes for children are to improve some aspects of written records and strengthen aspects of self review.</p><p>Specifically, they need to show in the written records of children&rsquo;s learning:</p><ul>
<li>what children&rsquo;s individual learning priorities are</li>
<li>how teachers make use of parent aspirations</li>
<li>the strategies teachers will use to extend on learning</li>
<li>how children&rsquo;s progress is evaluated over time.</li>
</ul><p>Managers need to continue to strengthen the whole teaching team&rsquo;s knowledge and implementation of planned in-depth self review. This should include a review of how well the resources and environment add depth to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of ABC Merivale completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's well-being:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>27 August 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
