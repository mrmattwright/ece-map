</table><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Merivale operates under the Best Start management structure. Best Start, previously known as Kidicorp Ltd, is a large national organisation that owns early childhood education and care centres across New Zealand.</p><p>Licensed for 50 children including 16 under twos, this centre provides two different full-day programmes in separate rooms to meet the varying care and learning needs of children. The recently-reviewed philosophy of empowering children to become increasingly independent is aimed at building positive foundations for life-long learning.</p><p>As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, the centre staff and children shifted to temporary premises for a number of months. This was managed very well, with staff receiving strong support from Best Start managers and from their parent community. The centre operates out of a villa that has now been completely renovated and upgraded. Some areas have been extended to provide increased space for children and staff to use.</p><p>The centre provides daily meals for all children including hot food at lunchtime. The changing menus reflect the centre's focus on nutritious food that children enjoy.</p><p>Centre leaders have made good progress addressing the recommendations for improvement in the 2012 ERO report related to written records of children's learning and self review. Since that time, there have also been some changes to centre staffing. ABC Merivale is actively involved with a local education cluster that is focused on positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the warm and welcoming centre environment that prioritises their wellbeing and sense of belonging. Learning activities and resources provide a wide range of opportunities for children to explore and follow their interests. Positive interactions and relationships are evident between children and their teachers.</p><p>Teachers make flexible use of learning spaces and resources to meet the children's changing needs and interests. Programmes and learning stories are based on observations of children that identify and inform the learning focus for group and individual teaching. Children are regularly able to explore and choose activities that stimulate their interest and curiosity.</p><p>Parents have good opportunities to contribute their ideas and feedback regarding their children's learning and wellbeing. Centre leaders and teachers keep them well informed about their child's progress and have a variety of ways of keeping them up to date with centre programmes and developments.</p><p>Children in the under two programme each have a primary caregiver. This helps to strengthen children's sense of attachment and growing independence as they progress through their time in the nursery. Teachers in this area use very good processes for identifying and monitoring individual children's learning and wellbeing. Parents have ongoing opportunities for input into this.</p><p>Centre programmes and activities provide children with some opportunities to learn about te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Some of the interesting wall displays created by children capture centre activities that promote an understanding of te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>Children with particular social, emotional or learning needs are very well supported by centre leaders and teachers. They readily access external expertise for children who need extra support. Teachers work hard to build knowledge, skills and practices to ensure that their support for children matches their specific needs.</p><p>Transitions into, within and out of the centre help children to settle and prepare for the next stage of their development. Positive relationships with contributing schools and clear transition processes and systems benefit children and their families.</p><p>Centre leadership reflects and promotes high expectations for the best outcomes for all children. The culture of collaboration among leaders and teachers enables them to actively share their strengths and contribute to centre programmes and goals for improvement.</p><p>The centre manager, professional service manager and business manager work in partnership to successfully implement Best Start management systems including quality assurance and strategic planning processes. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an annual centre review that identifies strengths and next steps for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provision of relevant internal and external professional development for centre staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership support for centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compliance and accountability monitoring.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the previous ERO review, centre leaders and staff have made some improvements to their self review practices. This is enabling them to clearly identify their next steps for ongoing improvement in a number of areas.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the priorities for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen assessment practices, especially in regard to consistently evaluating learning, identifying next steps and the specific strategies teachers will use to extend learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further increase the visibility of te ao MƒÅori in centre programmes, practices and learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build capability and expertise in internal evaluation across all staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Merivale will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>14 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
