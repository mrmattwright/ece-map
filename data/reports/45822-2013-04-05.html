<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Peacocks Early Learning Centre is a purpose built centre that was opened in 2012 by experienced early childhood educators. Policies and management systems are adapted from other centres under the same ownership. The centre is generously staffed by qualified teachers and has capable management.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for children from three months old to school age. Children are grouped into babies, toddlers, and two preschool groups: each group having its own room and team leader. The two younger age groups share an attractive and well resourced outdoor area, as do the two preschool groups.</p><p>Clearly expressed beliefs about teaching and learning guide all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operations. The principles of the Reggio Emilia philosophical approach to education, including the notion that teachers, as co-learners and collaborators with the child, guide teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s curriculum supports children to understand their world and to develop their own theories to explain how it works. There is a strong focus on providing an environment that will support learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides high quality education and care for children. Children engage in activities based on their interests. All aspects of their learning are well catered for. While the children are grouped by age, there are many appropriate opportunities for interactions across age groups. This supports their transitions through the centre as they move from room to room. Teachers are sensitive to the individual requirements of younger children and their families. Babies are nurtured in a calm and caring environment.</p><p>The programme actively engages children in learning, while allowing them to make decisions about how they spend their time. Limited interruptions are imposed by adults. Teachers observe children closely, and carefully consider the appropriateness of intervening in their activities. Children confidently discuss their ideas with adults and request resources to enrich their play.</p><p>Teachers successfully support children to work on projects over extended periods of time. These projects are sometimes sustained over several months. Planning documents show the progress of the project and clearly demonstrate how teachers think carefully about their role in providing resources and stimulating children&rsquo;s thinking. Individual portfolios and informal meetings at the centre help keep parents and wh&#257;nau informed about each child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The centre environment is carefully designed and resourced to enhance children&rsquo;s learning. Many of the varied resources are made from natural materials and are selected and arranged to extend children&rsquo;s interests. Children&rsquo;s work is displayed in ways that value and communicate children&rsquo;s ideas.</p><p>Strong professional leadership supports teachers to work effectively. Managers ensure that teachers&rsquo; new learning from professional development is put into practice. They encourage teachers to reflect on their practice through professional discussions. Centre leaders manage change well. Teachers are given time and help to assimilate new ideas and practices.</p><p>Self review is well understood and guides on-going improvement. Reviews are thoughtfully planned, and well informed by professional reading and relevant consultation. Centre-wide and room-specific reviews are conducted. Regular staff meetings encourage collaboration among teachers. Teachers constantly reflect on their teaching and the effectiveness of the programme.</p><p>Through effective self review, managers and teachers have identified priorities for further improvement. ERO agrees that these are relevant goals for the centre. Priorities include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>build on teachers&rsquo; skills in conducting self review</li>
<li>develop the centre&rsquo;s partnership with parents</li>
<li>develop teachers&rsquo; understanding of the roles children play in groups</li>
<li>strengthen the centre&rsquo;s commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi and support children&rsquo;s identities and cultures.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peacocks Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO encourages centre managers to strengthen their documenting of risk assessment and management when taking children on excursions from the centre.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
