</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Island Bay Playcentre is one of nineteen parent-led early childhood centres governed and administered by the Wellington Playcentre Association (the association). The playcentre is licensed to provide mixed age sessional education and care for 25 children, five mornings a week. This includes provision for 18 children, up to the age of two, at any one time.¬†</p><p>A council of elected volunteer representatives from each of the association's member centres, oversees the association at the governance level. This work is assisted by an operations manager and general manager. An executive committee administers the adult education programme. A centre support worker is employed to visit the centre and provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for the day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders.</p><p>Curriculum planning and implementation is a shared responsibility. Each session is supported by a duty team of parent educators who hold Playcentre training certificates.¬† Almost all centre members are involved in the association's training programme with a large proportion holding Course Two or above. Since the May 2014 ERO report the centre has sustained these very good numbers, taking advantage of this opportunity for active involvement in their child's education.¬†</p><p>The association philosophy, WhƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together, is articulated as empowering parents and children to learn, grow and play together. This underpins practice and was reaffirmed by the association and Island Bay Playcentre at their 2016 annual general meetings.</p><p>The service and the association have a positive reporting history with ERO. They responded positively to the areas identified for improvement in the 2014 ERO reviews. Internal evaluation and strategic planning were undertaken by association personnel to bring about changes to both the structural and organisational culture of the organisation. Clear boundaries between governance and management were expressed and changes made to improve support to individual centres.</p><p>The May 2014 ERO report also identified centre leaders would benefit from association support to further develop assessment, programme planning and provision of a bicultural curriculum through improved self-review practices.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation, of which the Wellington Association is part, is planning a significant restructure for 2017 that includes amalgamating associations. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine in the Wellington Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>All children's holistic development is enhanced through their engagement in child initiated <br> play-based learning. They enjoy each other's company and play amicably together, exploring and engaging in a range of appropriate learning activities. Attentive parent educators know the children and their preferences well. They are nearby to support and encourage ongoing engagement where needed.¬† Children‚Äôs social skills and developing relationships are well-supported. A positive tone and inclusive practice is highly evident.¬†</p><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and the playcentre philosophy underpin centre practice well. Parent educators have shared understanding of what they want children and families to experience during their time at playcentre and plans are in place that achieve this.¬†</p><p>Assessment, curriculum planning and evaluation practices provide adults with timely and useful information that helps them provide appropriate learning experiences responsive to children‚Äôs interests. Individual learning portfolios celebrate children's progress and successfully capture their developing skills, knowledge and attributes.</p><p>A comprehensive internal evaluation was undertaken, during 2014, to discover how well the association and centres included te reo and tikanga MƒÅori as part of a culturally responsive curriculum. Island Bay Playcentre participated in this process and carried out a further evaluation in late 2016. Children's daily experience of te ao MƒÅori is continually improving as a result of ongoing internal evaluation.</p><p>Rich and meaningful literacy, mathematics and science activities are a core component of children‚Äôs daily experience. The youngest children are embraced and nurtured within a culture of care.</p><p>Island Bay Playcentre members are a diverse group of enthusiastic parents and whƒÅnau who bring valuable skills and knowledge to their roles. The high levels of involvement of the centre's community and a sense of collective responsibility to children, provides a positive platform for learning. Well-developed systems support the smooth day-to-day running of the playcentre.¬†</p><p>The association is an improvement-focused organisation. The 2014 ERO reviews found the assistance provided at the centre level by association support workers was appreciated and supportive. ERO also recognised that formalising this arrangement to provide a more effective approach to responding to the needs of individual centres was a next step for development. The association, as part of reviewing their structural organisation, reviewed the position of centre support workers and made improvements to human resource management. Timely and relevant leadership and guidance is provided for its member centres.¬†¬†</p><p>The dual purpose of self review for accountability and improvement is understood well and used to inform decision-making. Planning priorities are aligned to the service and association vision and clearly positioned in improving teaching and learning.¬†</p><p>The centre support person and duty teams provide effective leadership that contributes positively to children‚Äôs early learning experience. Helpful strategies are in place to support newer members to the centre to document and record children's learning and progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Association and centre leaders should continue to improve outcomes for children and families by using internal evaluation effectively to ensure the very good practice occurring is sustained and prioritised developments are achieved.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Island Bay Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Island Bay Playcentre will be in four years.¬†</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>2 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
