</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This Early Childhood Learning Centre caters for children from birth to school age and is governed and managed by the University of Canterbury. Prior to 2014 the centre operated under two licenses but has now merged to operate as one centre.</p><p>The centre is arranged as two separate buildings, one for children aged under two and one for children over two years old. Each building has its own playground area.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, there have been some changes in staff and centre leadership. A head teacher oversees the day-to-day running of both areas. Overarching leadership is provided by a manager.</p><p>The families who use this centre come from many different cultural backgrounds. Acknowledging and celebrating this diversity is important to the centre. Many families have English as a second language. Some staff speak other languages.</p><p>Over 90% of the teaching staff have early childhood education qualifications. The centre also employs support staff.</p><p>The centre is part of the Riccarton Learning Cluster with local schools and other early childhood services. They are working together to strengthen transition from early childhood to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a shared and clearly-stated philosophy to guide centre practice. It is closely linked to Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum of New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers promote a child-centred programme that is making increasing use of children's interests and teachers' abilities to extend children's learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from the strong focus teachers place on building positive and secure relationships with them, especially when they first start at the centre. Interactions between teachers and babies are respectful, and are responsive to children’s cues and preferences. Children in the under two year old area are given time to make choices, follow their interests and explore the environment.</p><p>In the area for children over two years old, teachers work regularly alongside children in the programme. They have frequent conversations with them about their play. Teachers respond to and extend children’s interests and ideas.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to:</p><ul>
<li>develop self-care skills and independence</li>
<li>engage in social play and learn about playing successfully with others</li>
<li>use resources in a variety of creative ways</li>
<li>play in a natural environment and make use of natural resources to extend their play and ideas.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are responsive to the culture, language and identity of children and their families. They encourage parents and their children to share aspects of their culture. Resources often reflect home cultures and teachers include home languages in the programme.</p><p>Teachers have been focused on providing a broader range of curriculum experiences. This has included regular science and music experiences. Teachers also make regular use of University resources and facilities to extend children's learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers are including more te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme and in their practices.</p><p>There are well-organised overarching health and safety systems and resources. Staff have clear roles and responsibilities. Teachers work as a team and communicate well to support children during play and routines.</p><p>There is an ongoing emphasis on internal and external professional development for teachers. The positive impact of this is evident in aspects of the programme. Regular performance management reviews and discussions are building teacher capability.</p><p>Teachers often reflect on aspects of the programme. The team responsible for children under two recently completed a very good self review that showed a robust, well-documented inquiry into teaching practices. This is an exemplar to build on for future self-review practice.</p><p>Management and teachers use a range of useful ways to engage with parents, seek and respond to their views, and inform them about their child’s learning and centre events.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager, head teacher and ERO agree that the key next steps to improve the quality of the service include:</p><ul>
<li>extending the consistency of self review across the centre</li>
<li>documenting the evaluation and impact of the strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>showing partnerships with parents more clearly through planning for children’s learning and assessment.</li>
</ul><p>The manager and head teacher have identified, and ERO affirms, that they also need to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen planning and assessment, including more explicit reference to teaching strategies and how these will be evaluated</li>
<li>continue to focus on how the centre effectively responds to diverse cultures</li>
<li>continue to be involved with the University's strategic plan and current professional learning to maintain responsiveness to Māori learners</li>
<li>strengthen the performance review system to improve consistency.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified that checking on sleeping children and the daily environment for children aged under two need to be strengthened.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Childhood Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>7 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
