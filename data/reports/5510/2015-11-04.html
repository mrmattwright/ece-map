</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Reid Park Kindergarten is located in Mosgiel, close to Dunedin. It provides education and care for children from two-to-five years old. Forty children attend in the morning and thirty children stay for the afternoon.</p><p>The teachers are all qualified and have worked together for some years.</p><p>There have been recent renovations to the inside and outside areas. The outdoor area is still being developed. An enthusiastic parent committee supports the kindergarten through fundraising efforts.</p><p>The kindergarten has made some progress on developing self-review practices. This was a recommendation in the September 2012 ERO report.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the Dunedin Kindergartens (DK) umbrella. DK provides management and professional support for the teachers. This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have close and trusting relationships with their teachers. Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed, and they feel comfortable to stay and play alongside their children. This builds a strong sense of belonging and confidence for children in the kindergarten. Children play in a settled way and make friendships with one another. Teachers foster children’s caring attitudes and encourage them to help others.</p><p>Teachers play close attention to fostering children’s language development. Teachers encourage children’s talk, accept and respect what they say and build their confidence in social situations. Teachers respect children’s ideas and make sure they have a say in the design of the programme and environment. For example, children helped design the new cycle track.</p><p>Teachers get to know children well and use this knowledge to help plan interesting programmes for them. Teachers follow children’s enthusiasms to open up a world of learning. For example, the children’s interest in Matariki celebrations led them to exploring planets and the solar system. Children are learning about researching, mathematics and literacy through these interesting topics.</p><p>Children and teachers use te reo Māori through the day. Children enjoy and enthusiastically sing waiata and celebrate events such as Polyfest and Matariki. Māori perspectives are included in group planning. Group stories show how Māori children’s language, culture and identity are supported. However this is not so clear in individual children’s stories.</p><p>Teachers have useful systems for planning for individuals and groups of children. They seek parents’ wishes for their children’s learning and wellbeing and find ways to respond within planning.</p><p>The outdoor areas have been imaginatively designed to ignite children’s curiosity and invite physical exploration. They offer challenges and interest for all ages. Children benefit from a wide range of learning experiences such as gardening, cooking, excursions and community connections.</p><p>The teachers have responded to parents’ wishes and input from local schools in developing a planned transition-to-school programme for older children.</p><p>Teachers work well together. They know each other well and respect the strengths each contributes to the team. Teachers attend professional learning and development opportunities and use these to challenge and stimulate their thinking and to make improvements. Teachers have a useful format and schedule to guide self review. This has led to some improvements.</p><p>Teachers have a number of ideas about what they want for the future of the kindergarten. Their ideas could be developed into long-term plans that show the priorities and actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Related systems such as professional learning, appraisal, self-review topics and senior teacher support could then be aligned to strengthen the strategic focus.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association. </li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers and ERO agree that the next steps are to strengthen aspects of planning. The teachers and senior teachers should work together to consistently show:</p><ul>
<li>the intended learning and strategies in group plans</li>
<li>evaluation of the learning in group plans</li>
<li>genuine partnership with parents in how goals for children are decided</li>
<li>children’s progress in the records of learning</li>
<li>how children’s language, culture and identity are valued and affirmed in records of learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers could redesign their kindergarten philosophy to show the depth of priorities for learning and what makes this kindergarten unique.</p><p>Teachers need to further develop their understanding of rigorous self review and use this to review all aspects of the programme that have a significant impact on children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive are evaluative, show how well the DK’s vision and goals are met, and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent high quality practice across all kindergartens within the DK.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reid Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing: </p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Reid Park Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>4 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
