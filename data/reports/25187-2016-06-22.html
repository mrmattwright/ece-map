</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre is located in a residential suburb of Papakura. It is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 35 children, including up to 15 under two years old. The centre is divided into three areas for infants, toddlers and preschool children. All children have access to the outdoors.</p><p>The service is led by the centre manager who brings long serving educational experiences. The management group has developed policies and procedures which are regularly reviewed by teachers and parents. Professional development and support for staff is ongoing.</p><p>Over 80 percent of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers. The supervisor has responsibility for care routines and programme implementation for the different age groups.</p><p>The centre caters for a multicultural community. Teachers celebrate this diversity and encourage children to respect the languages and cultures of others. They provide specific support for children with identified special needs.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy focus is to create a friendly, safe and secure educational environment. The philosophy also places priority on acknowledging and incorporating bicultural practices into the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have positive relationships with staff. They enjoy friendships with each other and are developing self-management skills. Children have opportunities to participate in extra-curricular activities such as dancing, yoga, and music. They engage well with the resources and activities teachers provide. They would now benefit from further challenge in their learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers are nurturing and caring to children and respond well to their emotional needs. Teachers consistently engage with children and ask questions to encourage their involvement in play. They endeavour to set up an environment that reflects children's interests. They could now consider reviewing the ways they respond to children's different developmental stages and abilities.</p><p>Teachers use a sound planning framework that considers children‚Äôs interest. They appropriately modify the planning approach for infants and toddlers. They identify resources, activities, and some strategies to support learning.</p><p>Online portfolios have been successful in increasing parents‚Äô participation in children's learning and supplement the hard copy portfolios. Teachers' efforts to analyse learning in portfolios and to evaluate the centre programme helps to inform planning. They could now strengthen their focus on teachers' roles in extending children's learning.</p><p>Several strategies support bicultural practices. These include the celebration of MƒÅori festivals, the use te reo MƒÅori in portfolios, some teachers using te reo MƒÅori in conversations with children, and making aspects of tikanga MƒÅori visible in the environment. Pacific and other cultures are recognised through features such as a cultural wall that displays greetings in family languages. Staff reflect the cultures and home languages of the children.</p><p>Management systems are well established and contribute to the running of the centre. There is a good policy framework to guide centre operations. Whole team professional development is provided for teachers. A useful internal evaluation framework enables teachers to reflect on their practice and identify strategies for improvement. Managers could further enhance centre development by aligning their strategic plan to an annual plan that measures progress against the centre's longer-term strategic goals.</p><p>The service has well developed systems to support the growing leadership of the head teacher and teachers. This includes the implementation of a teacher performance appraisal system to support ongoing improvements in teaching, learning and centre performance. It could now be beneficial to work towards lifting teacher expectations through encouraging the identification of increasingly challenging individual goals for improving teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members agree that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>view how well the planning structure is guiding teachers to extend children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the ways they plan and cater for children's different developmental stages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align strategic and annual planning to better measure progress against centre strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include <em>TƒÅtaiako</em> <em>: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> in the centre appraisal process to strengthen teachers‚Äô focus on bicultural practices and to increase the rigour of performance management systems.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre - Papakura completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre - Papakura will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
