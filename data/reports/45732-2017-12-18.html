</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Pipis Childcare Incorporated is located in Pipitea House, Thorndon and is licensed for 24 children, including 15 up to two years old. It operates as a non-profit, parent cooperative and provides care and education for children whose parents work at, or have connections to Pipitea House. A parent management group governs the centre with the support of a manager.</p><p>The vision statement and philosophy is enacted through centre practices. Provision for infants and toddlers is underpinned by Pikler and Resources of Infant Education (RIE) teaching theory, which emphasises respectful practices and close attachments between adults and children.</p><p>Despite significant disruption due to the November 2016 earthquake, children‚Äôs care and learning has continued to be the priority for staff and managers. During 2017, the service licence was reassessed by the Ministry of Education, in response to conditions related to premises and facilities and health and safety matters.</p><p>The February 2014 ERO evaluation identified that the service should continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation, and self review. Progress is evident in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are engaged in their play for sustained periods. The inside environment has a good range of activities and resources to meet the interests and needs of each child. Teachers maintain a calm, unhurried pace in which younger children have space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Responsive relationships promote infants', toddlers' and young children's sense of wellbeing. Children are viewed as competent and capable learners. They show respect for their peers and have opportunities to play and learn alongside younger children. Children's social competence and independence are effectively promoted by teachers.</p><p>Teachers have made the most of the limited outside space so children experience a wide range of learning opportunities. Taking learning risks and problem solving is encouraged and enjoyed. The programme is further extended by regular excursions within the wider community.</p><p>Teachers carry out observations of children's learning and document their progress. They gather parents' views and aspirations to contribute to planning for children‚Äôs learning. The leader and management have identified that a next step is to continue to build on the teaching team‚Äôs collective knowledge and understanding of assessment practices.</p><p>Parents are warmly welcomed. Their skills are valued and partnerships in learning are evident in children's documentation. Children with diverse learning needs are well supported. Teachers work closely with parents and external agencies. Individual education plans support children and families learning goals.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are valued and evident in the programme. Waiata MƒÅori are popular with children. Culturally significant events are celebrated. A next step is for staff to implement a plan to enrich their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. Continuing to build on already established relationships with tangata whenua should better promote educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>Children's transitions into and out of the service are sensitively managed. A close working relationship has been established with the local school.</p><p>An appraisal process is currently in place that meets requirements. The centre has begun a review of the policy to better reflect their new leadership structure as well as incorporating the Education Council, <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession.</em></p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective and improvement-focused. They make use of research and consult with parents to inform ongoing developments. There is a shared understanding of the value of reviewing practices and processes that impact on children outcomes.</p><p>Leadership and the parent management group work collegially. All policies have been reviewed within the past three years. However, it is now timely to develop a schedule to ensure that all policies and procedures are regularly updated and approved.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes to ensure consistency of teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a process for the approval and ratification of centre policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further promote success for MƒÅori learners as MƒÅori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Pipis Childcare Incorporated completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review, the Ministry of Education has reassessed the licence status to a provisional licence. These matters relate to the deconstruction of a neighbouring building which will be completed in 2018.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Pipis Childcare Incorporated will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>18 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
