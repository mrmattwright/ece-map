</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Natures Cove Early Learning Centre caters for children from 3 months to school age. The centre provides all-day, school-day and morning sessions, in three age-related learning areas. The current roll is 44, with 4 children of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre philosophy places priority on building children's confidence to explore, experiment and express themselves. Teachers aim to develop children's skills to solve problems, take risks, persevere and have a sense of who they are.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review there has been a new owner and a change of name. A new centre manager has been appointed and there have been minor changes in staffing. Leaders remain committed to maintaining high adult-child ratios for more personalised care. There have been recent developments in all the areas identified for improvement in the 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Natures Cove, formerly KidzZone Preschool and Education Centre, is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The centre is effectively supported by the new owner and works closely with another centre in Tauranga under the same ownership. The owner respects the professional knowledge of the centre manager and teaching staff, and recognises the importance of developing shared decision making. Staff have had input into the strategic direction of the centre and increased ownership of decisions about processes and practices. Under the new ownership, the manager has increased responsibility for leadership and centre management. She has accessed appropriate professional development opportunities to develop her knowledge and understanding of her redefined roles. The manager is providing clear direction for centre development and improving outcomes for children. The centre is benefitting from the more collaborative approach to governance and management.</p><p>Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging are successfully fostered through the promotion of positive, caring and responsive relationships across the centre. They confidently interact with teachers, are actively engaged and have fun in their learning. Through child and teacher-initiated play, children are able to experiment and explore in environments that effectively encourage their imagination and creativity using a wide variety of natural and open-ended resources. Children are well supported to take responsibility for their learning and respond positively to new and challenging experiences.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are well integrated across a range of contexts. Teachers are effectively fostering the social competencies of children by supporting them to solve their own problems and to work cooperatively with others. They develop strong friendships and interact constructively with others. Children's learning is further enriched through excursions, centre events and activities, and visits from people of interest. They enjoy additional physical challenges within the local community, such as climbing rocks and trees at the nearby beach. Children actively participate in caring for the local beach area. They experience a rich curriculum that encourages the development of knowledge, skills and dispositions.</p><p>Children have access to well-planned outdoor areas that are adapted in response to their changing interests. Interactions between the different age groups foster positive relationships between older and younger children. Management and ERO agree that the indoor environments could be further enriched by placing displays at children‚Äôs level and including more meaningful bi-cultural perspectives.</p><p>Processes for transition into and within the centre are responsive to individual children and their parent's needs. Time is allowed for them to become familiar with the new learning space. Teachers also focus on building children's social competencies, learning dispositions and self-care skills to support their transition to school. Children experience positive transitions, supporting their wellbeing and sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers use basic te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in their teaching and learning processes. Celebrations such as MƒÅtariki help to develop an awareness and understanding of MƒÅori concepts and practices. Teachers acknowledge this as an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Teachers' professional development in planning and assessment has strengthened the focus on learning, and the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> Planning is increasing the complexity of children's learning in relation to the centre's philosophy. Teachers are beginning to regularly evaluate individual goals, enabling them to understand children's learning better and extend their dispositions, skills and understandings. It would be beneficial for teachers to review how effectively they recognise and respond to the emerging interests of children.</p><p>Parents are well informed about children's learning and development through informal conversations and individual portfolios. Electronic learning stories have increased parent and whƒÅnau input. Staff have identified the need to continue to build partnerships with parents and guide their understanding about how children learn through play. This should support parents to provide feedback focussed on their child's progress and development.</p><p>Babies learn and develop in a respectful and caring environment. They enjoy many opportunities to interact and build strong attachments with teachers. Babies explore and make sense of the world around them as they experiment with movement, language and a variety of resources. Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace and are flexible and responsive to the cues of the children. They respect children‚Äôs right to be informed and consulted about decisions that affect them. Teachers skilfully promote children‚Äôs oral language development and are developing their love of books. Regular communication with parents provides teachers with vital information about children‚Äôs preferences and needs. These very good practices contribute to high quality provision of care and learning for children up to two years of age.</p><p>The centre manager is currently reviewing all policies and procedures in consultation with teachers. Staff have reviewed how to effectively evaluate their practices in order to improve learning outcomes for children. The centre is in the early stages of implementing their revised processes for self review.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to enhance their practice through collaborative teamwork, appropriate personal goals and relevant professional development. A new appraisal system is developing more meaningful reflection about their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that the priorities for continuing development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop processes to implement effective self review and evaluation practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' capability and confidence to use bicultural practices in daily programmes and routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance displays of children's play and exploration to identify learning and include children's voice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Natures Cove Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Natures Cove Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>2 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
