<p>Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre opened in May 2010 and is situated adjacent to Welcome Bay School, Tauranga. It operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association and benefits from the personnel and administrative support provided by them. It is licensed to provide education and care for 40 children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review the kindergarten had a roll of 35, including 23 who are identified as M&#257;ori. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to encourage children to become self initiators of their learning. This is the first education review for the centre.</p>
<p>The kindergarten has benefited from strong, effective leadership and a consistent teaching team. Teachers have worked in close partnership with children and families to design, create and care for a spacious environment that reflects the high value placed on Papat&#363;anuku and natural science. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging as they explore, experiment and experience challenge with a wide range of interesting and open-ended equipment and materials.</p>
<p>Children participate in a programme that responds to and extends their strengths and interests. They have many opportunities to increase their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori through meaningful experiences. This includes manaakitanga, in welcoming and caring for each other and visitors to the centre. Teachers support children&rsquo;s developing concepts of literacy, mathematics and science through their conversations. Children&rsquo;s understanding of the wider community is enhanced by frequent, purposeful trips and excursions.</p>
<p>The head teacher fosters shared leadership responsibilities amongst the collegial teaching team. They have developed a shared philosophy that underpins the kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum and all aspects of its operations. This collaborative approach is promoting a calm, settled and inclusive atmosphere.</p>
<p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that reviewing aspects of centre planning and assessment and feedback to teachers about their practice are important next steps for centre development.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMaungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre opened in May 2010 to provide all day care and education for children in the Welcome Bay area of Tauranga. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to encourage children to become self initiators of their learning in a natural setting. A specifically designed wh&#257;nau room provides opportunities for a wide range of educational programmes for wh&#257;nau in the community. The kindergarten curriculum identifies five areas of learning, &lsquo;Ng&#257; Pou&rsquo;, which incorporate the beliefs and values the kindergarten holds for learning. These values are embedded in kindergarten policies and practices.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p><strong>Philosophy in action:</strong> Under the empowering leadership of the head teacher, the collegial teaching team has developed a shared philosophy that underpins the kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum and all aspects of its operations. This holistic curriculum is well designed to support the learning and development of children and their wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p><strong>Ko te ng&#257;kau aroha (holistic well-being):</strong> Children demonstrate high levels of respect and confidence in their interactions with adults and their peers. They have many opportunities to develop an understanding of te ao M&#257;ori, including manaakitanga in welcoming and caring for each other and visitors to the centre. Children and teachers work together in a calm and settled partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Whanaupiripiri (families and community working together):</strong> Teachers and the association place particular importance on developing positive partnerships with families and the wider community. A specifically designed wh&#257;nau room is used extensively to support families through a wide range of educational programmes. Teachers are supportive of families and encourage their active participation in all aspects of the kindergarten. Wh&#257;nau are well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning through attractively presented portfolios, wall displays and discussions with teachers. They have many opportunities to share their views and aspirations with teachers. Strong partnerships are being fostered with the adjacent Welcome Bay School, that assist children when transitioning.</p>
<p><strong>Whenua whangaihia (living alongside the natural world):</strong> A particular feature of the kindergarten is the strong connection to Papat&#363;anuku. Teachers and children work together to design, create and care for aspects of the environment including gardens, furniture and equipment. Children are taking increasing responsibility as kaitiaki of the land as an essential part of their learning. They benefit from an environment that:</p>
<ul><li>provides opportunities for safe physical challenge and risk-taking;</li>
<li>supports the particular needs of active learners to explore and experiment;</li>
<li>includes ready access to high-quality resources and equipment; and</li>
<li>engages them in meaningful and authentic learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Ng&#257; kete marama (explore and learn):</strong> Teachers plan and provide a programme that responds to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths. They extend children&rsquo;s knowledge and skills in literacy, mathematics and science through good use of conversations, questioning and involvement in authentic learning activities, including problem solving. Te ao M&#257;ori is well integrated into the programme and provides opportunities for children to build on their expertise and knowledge. The use of flexible routines promotes children&rsquo;s development as self-directed learners. ERO observed many examples of children involved in sustained play, both independently, and in groups of their own choosing. Children and their wh&#257;nau enjoy many planned excursions to explore the local and wider communities.</p>
<p><strong>Wairua (spiritual essence):</strong> There is recognition of the importance of supporting the wairua and emotional well-being of each child. This is evident through:</p>
<ul><li>a deliberate approach to developing children&rsquo;s skills in the creative arts;</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; deliberate provocation of, and sensitive response to, children&rsquo;s imagination, curiosity and sense of wonder; and</li>
<li>extensive opportunities to participate in karakia, kapahaka, story telling and dramatic play.</li>
</ul><h4>Agreed priorities for development and review</h4>
<p><strong>Self review:</strong> While the kindergarten leaders have implemented a programme of self review in a relatively short time, there is a need to strengthen aspects of this process. Consideration should be given to reviewing:</p>
<ul><li>strategic and annual planning to identify clear and measureable direction for centre development;</li>
<li>assessment processes to more consistently identify children&rsquo;s progress over time and further include a wh&#257;nau voice; and</li>
<li>practices to ensure teachers receive robust feedback about the quality of their teaching.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement</em> and<em> Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre.</p>
<p>Maungaarangi Kindergarten and Family Centre opened in May 2010 and is situated adjacent to Welcome Bay School, Tauranga. It operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association and benefits from the personnel and administrative support provided by them. It is licensed to provide education and care for 40 children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review the kindergarten had a roll of 35, including 23 who are identified as M&#257;ori. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to encourage children to become self initiators of their learning. This is the first education review for the centre.</p>
<p>The kindergarten has benefited from strong, effective leadership and a consistent teaching team. Teachers have worked in close partnership with children and families to design, create and care for a spacious environment that reflects the high value placed on Papat&#363;anuku and natural science. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging as they explore, experiment and experience challenge with a wide range of interesting and open-ended equipment and materials.</p>
<p>Children participate in a programme that responds to and extends their strengths and interests. They have many opportunities to increase their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori through meaningful experiences. This includes manaakitanga, in welcoming and caring for each other and visitors to the centre. Teachers support children&rsquo;s developing concepts of literacy, mathematics and science through their conversations. Children&rsquo;s understanding of the wider community is enhanced by frequent, purposeful trips and excursions.</p>
<p>The head teacher fosters shared leadership responsibilities amongst the collegial teaching team. They have developed a shared philosophy that underpins the kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum and all aspects of its operations. This collaborative approach is promoting a calm, settled and inclusive atmosphere.</p>
<p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that reviewing aspects of centre planning and assessment and feedback to teachers about their practice are important next steps for centre development.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
