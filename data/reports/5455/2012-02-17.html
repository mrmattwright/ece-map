<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley is located in the suburb of Shirley in Christchurch. Since the October 2007 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. The kindergarten currently operates all day sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two years old. It is licensed to provide care and education for up to 40 children. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>respectful interactions and positive relationships between teachers and children</li>
<li>a spacious learning environment and a daily programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and ideas</li>
<li>the way teachers foster children&rsquo;s confidence and independence, including encouraging them to use their knowledge of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme</li>
<li>the opportunities children have to develop their social skills and relationships with others.</li>
</ul><p>The next step for the teachers is to:</p><ul>
<li>identify children&rsquo;s learning more clearly in assessments and show how they intend to extend this learning in programme planning</li>
<li>more effectively document self-review practices.</li>
</ul><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and teachers.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The kindergarten vision states that teachers aim to provide a warm and welcoming environment where children and their families feel comfortable and safe. The programme is based on the interests and needs of the individual child. Teachers see their role as providing the environment and resources to extend children&rsquo;s learning and affirming them as confident and competent learners.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Children benefit from respectful interactions and positive relationships with their teachers. Teachers effectively involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play. Teachers know children well and show a keen interest in children&rsquo;s play ideas. They encourage children to talk about and share their thinking with others.</p><p>Teachers respond in ways that affirm and celebrate children&rsquo;s cultural identities. Teachers use home language greetings with children. They help children to learn about each other&rsquo;s cultures and languages. ERO observed children who were confident in using phrases of other languages. Aspects of a range of cultures were evident in wall displays. Teachers consult with and involve parents in offering cultural experiences to children in the programme.</p><p>Teachers model the use of te reo M&#257;ori and tikanga and encourage children to use their knowledge of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme. Some children demonstrated confidence in using familiar words and phrases of te reo M&#257;ori in the routines such as karakia, waiata, daily greetings and group time. Some children also used te reo M&#257;ori independently of teachers during their play.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop their social skills and relationships with others. Teachers provide consistent guidance to help children play successfully together. Children are encouraged to develop confidence in talking to their peers and being part of large groups.</p><p>Teachers effectively notice and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They plan a wide range of activities that encourage children&rsquo;s ongoing interests. They involve children in decisions about the daily setting up of the environment. Teachers are aware of children&rsquo;s involvement and offer ideas and additional resources to extend children&rsquo;s play. Teachers make good use of the community to broaden the range of experiences that they offer to children.</p><p>Children benefit from a spacious learning environment with a good range of resources and activities. Physical and imaginative play was prominent in the programme. Wall displays and information communication technologies (ICT) are effectively used to show children&rsquo;s interests and their involvement in the programme. Teachers also use ICT, such as digital cameras, to make meaningful links between children&rsquo;s home lives and their kindergarten experiences.</p><h3>Areas for review and development</h3><h4>Making teaching and learning more visible</h4><p>Assessment, programme planning and evaluation practices need to be strengthened to better focus on teaching and learning.</p><p>For assessment this includes:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the next steps that teachers will take to extend on individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>clearly showing progress of learning over time for individual children.</li>
</ul><p>For planning and evaluation this includes:</p><ul>
<li>making clearer how assessment information is used to plan the programme</li>
<li>identifying the intended learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>identifying teaching strategies to extend on the learning</li>
<li>evaluating the learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>more formally reflecting on the effectiveness of teaching strategies.</li>
</ul><h3>Self review</h3><p>The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that self-review practices could be strengthened through more effective documentation of the process.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p>As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>Although there are no children with identified moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this kindergarten, there are systems and practices in place to support the enrolment of a child with special needs.</p><p>These include clear policies and guidelines to support teachers to respond to these children and their families.</p><p>Teachers also have:</p><ul>
<li>previous experience of working with children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>knowledge and links to professional specialist agencies</li>
<li>a focus on building relationships and transition processes that are responsive to the individual needs of families and the child.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Kindergarten</h2><table>

</table><p>17 February 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-shirley" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Shirley is located in the suburb of Shirley in Christchurch. Since the October 2007 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. The kindergarten currently operates all day sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two years old. It is licensed to provide care and education for up to 40 children. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>respectful interactions and positive relationships between teachers and children</li>
<li>a spacious learning environment and a daily programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and ideas</li>
<li>the way teachers foster children&rsquo;s confidence and independence, including encouraging them to use their knowledge of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme</li>
<li>the opportunities children have to develop their social skills and relationships with others.</li>
</ul><p>The next step for the teachers is to:</p><ul>
<li>identify children&rsquo;s learning more clearly in assessments and show how they intend to extend this learning in programme planning</li>
<li>more effectively document self-review practices.</li>
</ul><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of kindergarten performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this kindergarten.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this kindergarten.</p></html>
