<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten, located in the eastern suburbs of Auckland City, shares a site with the Pakuranga Baptist Church. The kindergarten provides very good quality education and care for children between the ages of two to five years old.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report acknowledged the well resourced learning environment, and the respect teachers had for children as competent, confident and independent learners. These positive judgements continue to be relevant. Since the 2009 ERO review the centre has responded positively to the areas identified for development regarding programme planning, assessment and self review.</p><p align="left">A positive, warm and respectful culture is highly evident in the kindergarten. Centre staff have worked with parents to develop a set of values that underpin and guide how the kindergarten operates. These values are defined as collaboration, respect, beauty, wonder, responsibility and openness. Christian principles and values are also of key importance. The centre philosophy and values are enacted in teacher practice and children&rsquo;s play. As a result children and parents demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</p><p align="left">Very good planning and assessment practices help teachers to respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and build on their prior learning. Teachers give careful thought to how programme planning and teachers&rsquo; interactions challenge children to develop independent thinking and reasoning in their play. Children are supported in meaningful ways to develop early literacy and mathematical skills.</p><p align="left">The management committee and centre supervisor manage the kindergarten efficiently. They have clear roles and responsibilities and useful procedures to promote the well being and safety of children and adults in the centre. The supervisor is a reflective professional leader who uses research and current theories and approaches to continue to improve outcomes for children. High quality self review systems are also used to ensure continuous improvement in the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPakuranga Baptist Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten provides mixed-age sessional and full day education and care for pre-school children. The management committee employs a centre supervisor to take responsibility for day-to-day centre operations. The centre has low staff turnover and all teaching staff are qualified.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><ul>
<li>Respectful relationships.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children enjoy warm, positive relationships with adults and each other. Teachers respect children as capable learners and are very attentive to children. They have high expectations for children and set clear boundaries. Children are given opportunities to be leaders, taking responsibility for themselves and for others. Staff team work supports the development of a positive centre culture and good outcomes for children.</p><ul>
<li>Teacher interactions.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; skilful interactions support children&rsquo;s play. They respond enthusiastically to child initiated conversations and provide constructive feedback and support collaborative play. Teachers use effective questioning to promote creative thinking and problem solving.</p><ul>
<li>Programme planning and assessment.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have developed effective planning and assessment practices that enable them to support in-depth learning for children. Planning approaches are flexible and responsive, allowing teachers to cater for diversity and children&rsquo;s emerging interests. There are opportunities for children to contribute to programme planning. Attractive records of group and individual learning are available for children and families to revisit.</p><ul>
<li>Language and literacy development.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children are well supported to develop their early literacy understanding and skills. They are provided with meaningful opportunities to explore language, and they enjoy reading and writing with teachers, their peers, or as an independent activity. Writing materials are available at all times and books are placed in different learning areas. Children develop good literacy foundations as part of their preparation for school.</p><ul>
<li>Science learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s scientific thinking is fostered and celebrated. Children are encouraged to develop working theories about the world around them. Programme planning supports children to develop their understandings over time, and share their learning with others. The natural environment is well used as a source for scientific discovery.</p><ul>
<li>Learning environment.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The learning environment is inviting and well resourced for children&rsquo;s learning. Good use is made of natural resources, space and light. Teachers skilfully create attractive areas of play for children&rsquo;s exploration and discovery. Children are able to select resources independently and use them to support their play. They show respect and take responsibility for their environment.</p><ul>
<li>Self review.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The centre supervisor has established systems for robust and regular self review. Children, staff and parents are included in the self-review process. Programme evaluations show that teachers reflect on their practice with a view to improving outcomes for children. Staff are well placed to ensure continuous improvement in the centre.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The centre has appropriately identified the following areas as priorities for their own development and review:</p><ul>
<li>exploring ways children&rsquo;s cultures can be more prominent in programme planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>investigating current research to support provision for gifted and talented children</li>
<li>continuing to work with the church and kindergarten committee to seek new ways to build stronger community networks of support for families.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendation</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that teachers should continue to use self review to support the achievement of positive outcomes for children.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><p>18 May 2012</p><p>To the Parents and Community of Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten</p><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten, located in the eastern suburbs of Auckland City, shares a site with the Pakuranga Baptist Church. The kindergarten provides very good quality education and care for children between the ages of two to five years old.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report acknowledged the well resourced learning environment, and the respect teachers had for children as competent, confident and independent learners. These positive judgements continue to be relevant. Since the 2009 ERO review the centre has responded positively to the areas identified for development regarding programme planning, assessment and self review.</p><p align="left">A positive, warm and respectful culture is highly evident in the kindergarten. Centre staff have worked with parents to develop a set of values that underpin and guide how the kindergarten operates. These values are defined as collaboration, respect, beauty, wonder, responsibility and openness. Christian principles and values are also of key importance. The centre philosophy and values are enacted in teacher practice and children&rsquo;s play. As a result children and parents demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</p><p align="left">Very good planning and assessment practices help teachers to respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and build on their prior learning. Teachers give careful thought to how programme planning and teachers&rsquo; interactions challenge children to develop independent thinking and reasoning in their play. Children are supported in meaningful ways to develop early literacy and mathematical skills.</p><p align="left">The management committee and centre supervisor manage the kindergarten efficiently. They have clear roles and responsibilities and useful procedures to promote the well being and safety of children and adults in the centre. The supervisor is a reflective professional leader who uses research and current theories and approaches to continue to improve outcomes for children. High quality self review systems are also used to ensure continuous improvement in the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
