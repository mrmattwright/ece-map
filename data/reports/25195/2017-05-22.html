</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>8’s Enuff is a small privately owned centre in a well-established residential area in Farm Cove, <br> East Auckland. It provides a sessional and full day service for up to 15 children at a time, aged between two and five years of age. The centre is staffed by two qualified teachers and the centre owner. The team has remained the same since the 2015 ERO review. Teachers have a shared philosophical belief in children learning through play, with a strong focus on literacy and numeracy.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report commented positively on relationships between staff, children and families. Teachers have addressed ERO's recommendations for improvements to the programme and management practices. External professional development to strengthen curriculum planning has motivated teachers and improved practice. Children's wellbeing continues to be promoted.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a home-like, attractive and well-resourced environment. The centre is organised in response to children's interests and to encourage them to try new activities. Children have many opportunities to include literacy, mathematics and science as part of their play and discussions. They are encouraged to be creative and expressive though art, music, dance and dramatic play. Regular excursions into the community support children's physical development and maintain local connections.</p><p>Children are confident communicators, who play cooperatively for long periods. They have fun, are imaginative and investigative, and experience challenge and success. Children have a strong sense of belonging, are developing friendships and show concern for others. They are eager to learn and benefit from doing so at an individualised pace in a calm environment.</p><p>Teachers’ sensitive and supportive interactions underpin children’s high levels of engagement in the programme. Teachers affirm and build on children’s strengths. They listen carefully to children, support sustained conversations and encourage children to problem solve. Child-led learning is valued and purposefully extended.</p><p>Respectful and responsive relationships, and a good knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, underpin programmes. With external support, teachers have developed sound group planning processes to guide programme implementation. Vibrant displays show how children are involved in learning. Children's assessment portfolios document children’s individual progress and learning well.</p><p>Teachers’ capabilities and leadership are fostered through ongoing professional development. The centre owner and teachers have a genuine commitment to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Biculturalism is fostered through meaningful opportunities for children to become familiar with te reo and tikanga Māori and to learn about te ao Māori through play. These practices are well documented through learning stories and other programme records.</p><p>Families are well informed about their children’s progress and provide positive feedback about the education and care their children receive. Teachers are very responsive to parental aspirations and encourage a sense of partnership. They value this as an integral part of early childhood education. Teachers have good links with the local schools and other facilities. Children’s transitions into the centre and to school are responsive to individual children and whānau needs.</p><p>Engagement with advisory support has had a positive impact on centre management practices, including the documentation of strategic and annual plans. There are effective systems to monitor health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and teachers agree that next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>restating their vision and strategic goals to guide centre direction and inform action plans and a cycle of review</li>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation to include greater depth in research and evidence, and alignment to strategic direction</li>
<li>refining the teacher appraisal process to meet the requirements of the Education Council of NZ</li>
<li>deepening teachers' evaluation of the effectiveness of their teaching practice and programmes for children</li>
<li>evaluating how well teaching strategies and practices respond to children's cultural identities and home languages.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of 8's Enuff completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of 8's Enuff will be in three years. </p><p>Steffan Brough<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>22 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
