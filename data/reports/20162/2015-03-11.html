</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunnynook Pre-School in Glenfield, Auckland, has been operating for nearly 40 years. It is licensed for a maximum of thirty-five children over two years of age for sessional and all day education and care. Children attending are three and four years old. Traditionally, centre programmes have had a strong focus on preparing children for school.</p><p>The centre is privately owned. The current owner, who took over the centre in 2013, has considerable experience in early childhood education. The teaching team is headed by the centre manager and consists of qualified, registered teachers. It includes long-serving staff members as well as two more recently appointed Chinese teachers, who further strengthen the centre‚Äôs capacity to support the high proportion of Chinese children attending the centre.</p><p>The change of ownership has brought support, guidance and expectations for excellence that have been welcomed by the centre manager and teachers. A new strategic direction and philosophy statement has been collaboratively developed. Areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO report are being addressed. They include developments in programme planning and assessment, and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to become confident, competent learners and communicators. They have a strong sense of belonging. They are self-managing learners who happily engage with teachers and each other. Parents are warmly welcomed and are encouraged to involve themselves in their children‚Äôs learning. Trusting relationships underpin children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Children are provided with a stimulating, educational environment. The plentiful resources are well organised and accessible for adults and children. Prominent in the environment are resources that promote children‚Äôs learning in literacy, mathematics and science. The thoughtfully planned and resourced indoor and outdoor environments promote children‚Äôs social, physical, and intellectual wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers know the children very well. They are aware of the children that have MƒÅori or Pacific heritage. They are supportive of children for whom English is a new language. Children are encouraged to use their home language and to help each other. Teachers are very responsive and nurture children with special learning needs.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The owner works strategically with the centre manager and staff to promote high quality education and care.</p><p>After purchasing the centre, the owner in consultation with staff, parents and community quickly reviewed and established short term priorities for centre redevelopment. These priorities included ensuring the physical and emotional safety for all staff and families, and building effective administration and management processes. New approaches encourage the centre manager and teachers to extend their capabilities through professional learning and through participation in good quality teacher appraisal processes. Self review and strategic planning for continued improvement are becoming a more integral part of centre operations.</p><h4>Key Next Steps</h4><p>ERO, the owner and centre manager agree that from 2015 centre strategic planning should include goals for:</p><ul>
<li>aligning programme planning, assessment, and evaluation with current educational theory and teaching practice</li>
<li>strengthening biculturalism to better reflect <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>staff professional learning and development in te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunnynook Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunnynook Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
