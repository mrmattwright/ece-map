</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rural Scholars Early Learning Centre is a privately owned centre in Waimate, South Canterbury. The purpose-built centre provides all-day care and education for babies and children up to school age. It is located on the owner‚Äôs farm property. The animals on the farm have become an important part of the centre‚Äôs programme.</p><p>The owner manages the centre and supports the teachers in the programme. At the time of this review the centre employed five trained teachers and three more who are in training.</p><p>Since the centre‚Äôs first ERO visit in 2011 there have been significant developments. The children learn in three different age groupings for much of the day. Children under the age of two have their own room and outside play area. Two and three year olds learn in another room and a classroom for four-year-old children has been added recently. The children all enjoy the centre's extensive gardens where they grow fruit and food for the animals.</p><p>Other areas of progress since ERO‚Äôs last review include the development of:</p><ul>
<li>the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plan</li>
<li>a range of policies and procedures to guide centre practices and operations</li>
<li>self-review processes.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from the strong, supportive relationships they have with the teachers at Rural Scholars. Teachers know the children well and recognise their strengths and interests. They have created an environment that encourages children to learn and develop. The centre is well organised and teachers have established routines and clear expectations for children‚Äôs behaviour. This helps children have a feeling of security and sense of belonging.</p><p>The children in the under-two room learn and play in a quiet, calm environment. The teachers are sensitive to their needs and responsive to their cues. Children‚Äôs learning has been supported by teachers‚Äô intentional planning through a range of sensory experiences.</p><p>Teachers provide good quality resources and a variety of experiences to promote and extend the children‚Äôs interests and development.</p><p>A key feature of the programme is the access to and use of the farm adjacent to the centre. The centre vision is ‚Äòlearning alongside nature and creating a culture of respect‚Äô. Children experience a wide range of nature-related learning opportunities during daily excursions to the farm. They also learn how to approach and respond to animals and treat them with respect.</p><p>The teachers have gathered a range of useful resources to support them with the inclusion of cultural perspectives in the programme. The programme is enriched by MƒÅori and Pacific whƒÅnau contributing their knowledge and skills. These experiences are helping children develop an awareness of diversity and link them to the wider world. Children also benefit from a variety of literacy and mathematics experiences throughout the day.</p><p>The owner and teachers have a strong commitment to establishing a unique centre and to ongoing improvement. The teachers seek regular input from parents to support children‚Äôs learning and the development of the centre. Teachers have close links with the community and regularly participate in community events. Since the last ERO review, the centre leaders established a celebration for MƒÅtariki in Waimate. This celebration has now become an important community event. The process enabled the centre to make valuable links with the local marae.</p><p>The owner works collaboratively with her team. She encourages their involvement with regular professional development. This helps the teachers build their capacity as leaders and children benefit from the teachers‚Äô strengths and passions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers need to continue to build the focus on children‚Äôs learning. It would be helpful to start with being clear about the meaning of the vision statement so this can guide teaching practice and programme planning. Teachers need to make the learning intentions for each child more visible in planning and ensure they include the parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning. This will help develop the learning programme and improve the evaluation process.</p><p>To further build leadership with a focus on children‚Äôs learning, the manager needs to continue to develop a professional support network for herself. This includes developing appraisal to cover the teaching aspect of her work.</p><p>Other areas to strengthen include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the leaders‚Äô and teachers‚Äô understanding of the evaluative aspect of self review</li>
<li>developing the review schedule to ensure that those aspects that impact most on children are evaluated regularly</li>
<li>risk assessment management for outings to the farm.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rural Scholars Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rural Scholars Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
