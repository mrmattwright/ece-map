</tr></tbody></table><p>St Andrews College Preschool is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>St Andrews College Preschool caters for 42 children aged over two. The learning environment is attractively presented and well maintained with good support from the wider college community. The children and families come from the local area. The teaching staff are well qualified early childhood teachers who have worked together as a team for many years. They continue to provide a stable, friendly learning environment for children. Better than minimum teacher-to-child ratios are providing good opportunities for sustained interactions between teachers and children.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children experience strong, positive relationships with their teachers and peers. Teachers know children well and plan a range of learning experiences across a broad curriculum to meet their interests and needs. The best features of the programme include opportunities for children to:</p>
<ul><li>satisfy their curiosity, interests and abilities through science, mathematics, art, photography, physical activity or music</li>
<li>experience success, including MƒÅori children who benefit by the way their language and culture are being incorporated in some of the learning activities</li>
<li>learn mathematical concepts and language across a range of appropriate activities such as baking, construction, music and art</li>
<li>experience different forms of literacy, including MƒÅori literacy through meaningful practical activities such as drama, poetry, waiata or the enactment of myths or legends.</li>
</ul><p>The learning environment is structured and activities are used as the catalyst for children‚Äôs learning. Children have some opportunities to pose questions and independently find answers to satisfy their curiosities. This could be further developed in order to continue to build on children‚Äôs skills in becoming confident, competent learners.</p>
<p>The centre has good access to the college‚Äôs preparatory school. Children in the centre have many opportunities to interact with the older children and to experience the school environment. The centre staff have developed an area to support children‚Äôs transition to school. This area needs to be reviewed in terms of its links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p>
<p>Teachers effectively work together as a team. They recognise and use each other‚Äôs strengths and skills to develop a programme that provides interest, variety and challenges for children. They are very well led by the head teacher.</p>
<p>Parents are warmly welcomed. Partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau are a key focus of the centre‚Äôs philosophy and practice. The regular sharing of information, as an informal chat or an assessment story, about children‚Äôs experiences and learning helps to strengthen these connections. Teachers regularly seek parent contributions and ideas and respond well to children‚Äôs ideas as observed throughout the programme.</p>
<p>The centre programme is well supported by the licensee. Programmes are regularly reviewed to ensure children have access to good-quality learning opportunities. The centre‚Äôs self-review process focuses on ongoing improvement. The process can be further strengthened by making sure recommendations continue to be systematically responded to and reported on.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The centre‚Äôs expectations for mathematics and literacy are not clearly stated in writing. Such documentation is likely to ensure the sustainability of the good practices observed by ERO.</p>
<p>Centre Leaders need to review the effectiveness of the transition room in meeting the needs of children transitioning to school.</p>
<p>The leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that staff should continue to work closely with MƒÅori whƒÅnau to make the bicultural aspects of the programme more visible in key documents such as the philosophy, programme planning and assessment and in the environment.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Andrews College Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of St Andrews College Preschool will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
