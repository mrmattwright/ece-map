</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tikorangi Playcentre has a shared boundary and close relationship with Tikorangi School. It is situated next to an area of mature native bush which is used to provide learning opportunities for children. It is licensed for 30 children, including 15 children up to two years old, and offers two sessions each week.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 parent led services governed under the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association) umbrella. The governance of these centres has recently reverted to a structure where all centres' representatives contribute to association decisions and priorities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have positive and productive partnerships with adults in the centre. Parent educators are actively involved with their own and other children and promote affirming interactions which support sustained play and learning. They use strategies well to extend children‚Äôs language and thinking.</p><p>Children demonstrate confidence as independent learners and willingness to participate successfully in mixed-aged group play and learning activities. Recent developments in planning are responsive to individual children‚Äôs interests and model ways adults can participate in planned learning experiences. Appropriate spaces and resources enable parents to nurture and interact positively with infants and babies.</p><p>Experienced playcentre parents provide support and modelling for new members and plan leadership succession. Annual planning is being developed to better reflect specific needs and aspirations of the centre. To sustain ongoing centre development members should consider recording the results of annual reviews against expected outcomes.</p><p>Both Tikorangi Playcentre and the association have annual plans that inform operational decisions. There are few links between the association and individual playcentre goals. The association‚Äôs strategic vision does not effectively focus on priorities for improving teaching and learning.</p><p>Centre educators have made progress with learning to use and model aspects of tikanga MƒÅori in daily activities and building confidence in using te reo MƒÅori to promote bicultural perspectives. Puriri W‚Äôakamaru o Taranaki is a role established by the association to build bicultural understandings. Playcentre parents can seek advice and work alongside Puriri W‚Äôakamaru o Taranaki to develop strategies to support their children's learning. Further discussion and consultation with whƒÅnau and iwi should contribute to more explicit and deliberate strategies for promoting success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori.</p><p>Children participate in a wide range of planned experiences and excursions to enrich their learning. Visits to nearby native bush, places of interest and interactions with the neighbouring school extend their thinking and links to their local community. These visits and events strengthen relationships, develop language and extend children‚Äôs exploration skills and knowledge using the local environment.</p><p>Recent evaluative self review demonstrates that parents are beginning to use review to make decisions to improve programme planning and evaluation of children's learning. Members are currently reviewing the quality and effectiveness of how new families are welcomed into the centre.</p><p>Centre leaders are aware that the daily programme evaluation and assessment of learning need review and further development to build all parents' capacity in this area. Further professional development should improve the rigour and impact of self review for ongoing centre improvement.</p><p>Positive relationships and links with the nearby school support children‚Äôs transition to their next stage of education. Further development of programmes and records of learning should improve parents' understanding of children‚Äôs achievement and strengths particularly as they move to school.</p><p>Self review of philosophy has led to an increased focus on parents‚Äô role as educators. This provides a platform for further improvements to the learning programme for children. Most parents are actively involved in training to gain qualifications through playcentre courses and workshops.</p><p>Association personnel regularly visit and provide advice and guidance for bicultural, centre and property support. Positive relationships between playcentres and those people in support roles are evident. Extending and improving the support the association offers to playcentres is an important next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders in partnership with the association should:</p><ul>
<li>provide parents with ongoing support for assessing children's learning</li>
<li>further develop their understanding and use of self review of practices and annual goals and priorities across the centre</li>
<li>extend their understanding, promotion and use of strategies to promote success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><p>The association would benefit from external support to strengthen and improve understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>annual and strategic planning that better informs priorities for teaching and learning</li>
<li>relevant approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>fostering opportunities to enable MƒÅori children to have success as MƒÅori</li>
<li>supporting members understanding of teaching and learning, and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>current self-review approaches.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tikorangi Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tikorangi Playcentre will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>26 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
