<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay provides very good quality education and care for children from three months to approximately three years of age. The centre operates from the same premises as Bear Park Preschool Mairangi Bay. Children often move from the childcare centre to the preschool.</p><p align="left">Both centres operate under the umbrella of the Bear Park franchise. The franchise management team provides useful support and guidance to the centres, assisting them with organisational systems, meeting regulatory requirements, and helping to ensure that their care and education programmes are underpinned by sound professional practice. The management team contributes to the effective self-review processes used in the centres.</p><p align="left">The education programme is influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Staff see children as competent learners who construct their own working theories about the world. Teaching practices follow this philosophy within the framework of Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy participating in and helping to plan the programme and are skilled at directing their own learning. They persist at tasks, often revisiting their investigations over long periods of time. Children work cooperatively and often collaborate over activities.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide a very positive and supportive environment for children. They know the children and their families well. Babies are well cared for, and centre routines meet their needs in a stimulating language-rich environment. Teachers interact with all age groups with respect, valuing children&rsquo;s contributions in conversations, making good use of questions to support children&rsquo;s thinking and language development. Teachers are skilled at understanding children&rsquo;s perspectives and give them time to test and consider their ideas.</p><p align="left">The physical environment reflects the centre philosophy and is resourced appropriately, encouraging children to explore and experiment. Children are well supported to become independent problem solvers who contribute and think critically and creatively.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO report commented on the high standard of care provided for children in an attractive, caring and welcoming environment. Positive interactions between children and teachers were identified as a key feature of the programme. The report noted that teachers worked together to support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. ERO recommended that teachers use strategies to increase the participation of parents and children in programme planning and self review.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Positive outcomes for children. Warm, welcoming and respectful interactions with teachers help children to settle quickly into the programme. Children make choices about their activities and engage enthusiastically in a variety of experiences and learning opportunities. Children appear secure and happy in the centre and are confident and focused in their play.</p><p align="left">Teaching practices. Teachers know the children well and make frequent links between the centre and children&rsquo;s home environments. Teachers promote children&rsquo;s self-care skills and independence. They model clear behaviour expectations for children and encourage turn taking and negotiation. Teachers respond to individual children&rsquo;s abilities and interests. Routines are used as learning opportunities, where teachers continue to build relationships and engage children in conversations.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. The spacious and attractive environment enables children to explore and investigate. It reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and a commitment to the use of natural resources. Teachers adapt the learning environment in response to children&rsquo;s play and skilfully integrate learning about literacy, numeracy and science. Wall displays focus on children&rsquo;s involvement in sustained group investigations.</p><p align="left">Programme management. Teachers, through reflective discussions, plan programmes in response to children&rsquo;s interests. They encourage children&rsquo;s involvement in collaborative group investigations. Planning is supported by thoughtful assessment and evaluation. Regular entries in children&rsquo;s portfolios show good individual records of learning and reflect the range of experiences available to children.</p><p align="left">Partnerships with parents. Families express a high level of satisfaction with the centre. They appreciate the reciprocal and trusting relationships they have developed with teachers. A wide variety of communication techniques, including an online parent portal, continues to provide opportunities for parents and teachers to work together. The regular informal sharing of information about children, as well as formal parent/teacher interviews and parent evenings, results in parents being well informed about the centre programme and their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Management and self review. Annual and strategic management plans focus on ongoing improvement. Self-review processes are systematic, well established and reflective. Strategic planning and self review guide and enhance the children&rsquo;s learning programme. Constructive feedback from an advisory manager enables teachers to refine their teaching. The licensee, managers and teachers have responded positively to the recommendations in the previous ERO report. Considerable progress has been made in enhancing self-review and management systems.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">To enhance existing high quality practices, centre managers and teachers could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to encourage parents to contribute to individual portfolios and the planning and assessment of their child&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>use the centre&rsquo;s planning guidelines to review the evaluation of individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>enhance the teacher appraisal process by setting goals that are more measureable and therefore enable teachers to gauge their own progress.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">Two M&#257;ori children are currently enrolled in the centre.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Relationships with parents/wh&#257;nau. Teachers take time to get to know wh&#257;nau of children enrolling in the centre. They communicate regularly with parents, spending time with them at drop-off and pick-up times. Parents report that they are listened to and feel comfortable spending time with their children before leaving for the day.</p><p align="left">The programme. Teachers make a concerted effort to include aspects of M&#257;ori language and culture in the programme. They use te reo M&#257;ori during mat times and informally in the programme. Matariki has become a focus for the centre. The use of poi and waiata is evident in the programme.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p align="left">To improve current practice, centre managers and teachers could use Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s M&#257;ori education strategy, to review centre policies and teaching practices in relation to provision for M&#257;ori children.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-bear-park-childcare-mairangi-bay" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay.</p><p align="left">Bear Park Childcare Mairangi Bay provides very good quality education and care for children from three months to approximately three years of age. The centre operates from the same premises as Bear Park Preschool Mairangi Bay. Children often move from the childcare centre to the preschool.</p><p align="left">Both centres operate under the umbrella of the Bear Park franchise. The franchise management team provides useful support and guidance to the centres, assisting them with organisational systems, meeting regulatory requirements, and helping to ensure that their care and education programmes are underpinned by sound professional practice. The management team contributes to the effective self-review processes used in the centres.</p><p align="left">The education programme is influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Staff see children as competent learners who construct their own working theories about the world. Teaching practices follow this philosophy within the framework of Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy participating in and helping to plan the programme and are skilled at directing their own learning. They persist at tasks, often revisiting their investigations over long periods of time. Children work cooperatively and often collaborate over activities.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide a very positive and supportive environment for children. They know the children and their families well. Babies are well cared for, and centre routines meet their needs in a stimulating language-rich environment. Teachers interact with all age groups with respect, valuing children&rsquo;s contributions in conversations, making good use of questions to support children&rsquo;s thinking and language development. Teachers are skilled at understanding children&rsquo;s perspectives and give them time to test and consider their ideas.</p><p align="left">The physical environment reflects the centre philosophy and is resourced appropriately, encouraging children to explore and experiment. Children are well supported to become independent problem solvers who contribute and think critically and creatively.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p></html>
