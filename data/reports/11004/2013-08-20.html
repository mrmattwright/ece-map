</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Footprints Educare is a well established service that operates as part of the Kaitaia Abundant Life Centre Trust. Day to day management is delegated to the centre manager who reports to trustees. The centre provides full-day care and education for up to 65 children including up to 20 infants and toddlers. These younger children share two separate rooms but mix with older children for some activities and when numbers are low. A strong Christian-based philosophy underpins the centre practices and programmes.</p><p>The centre has a high number of qualified teachers who bring MƒÅori cultural knowledge, and languages that match those of centre families. A restructuring of leadership roles early in 2013 has resulted in team leaders being appointed in each of the two centre areas. This arrangement has supported teachers‚Äô development and enabled them to have better ownership of programme planning and assessment.</p><p>In 2010 ERO identified many very good features in centre practices. Positive aspects of teaching and learning continue to be evident and teachers have improved children's access to resources. In 2010 the manager was strengthening several management practices. She has since appointed an administrative assistant who is helping to progress this work.</p><p>The centre has recently had its roll capacity increased by 15. Although actual attendance has not significantly changed, a planned extension to the outdoor environment will help to cater for the potential increase in numbers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the centre. They have very positive relationships with teachers and some clearly enjoy sharing conversations about their play or home experiences. Children enthusiastically choose activities of interest, often working independently but also cooperating well with their peers. They move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments and frequently engage in play that supports their early literacy and numeracy development. Infants and toddlers are encouraged to be independent explorers and make discoveries from a good range of accessible resources.</p><p>MƒÅori children are particularly well supported through a high MƒÅori content in the programme. This includes te reo, waiata, karakia, resources with MƒÅori themes and participation in p≈çwhiri. Children with special needs are valued and individually supported. Their inclusion in play and welcome by other children is noteworthy. In this supportive environment tuakana/ teina relationships are evident and children show a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They show a strong commitment to valuing children's languages, cultures and identity, recognising individual strengths and knowledge, and family aspirations. Teachers encourage children to learn at their own pace providing prolonged periods of uninterrupted play to enable them to repeat or sustain an activity. Teachers integrate Christian teachings through mat activities and positive approaches to behaviour management.</p><p>Teachers work effectively as collaborative teams. They communicate efficiently and receive good support from the manager to take shared responsibility for children's learning. They have recently reviewed and improved their planning processes. They are now strongly focused on responding to individual interests and have an increased expectation that families will contribute to their children‚Äôs individual plans. Teachers record children's learning well in assessment portfolios and make very good use of photographs to demonstrate achievements.</p><p>While teachers plan separately for babies, toddlers and young children, there is continuity in planning and careful transitioning as children move between rooms. Teachers also endeavour to prepare children well for school, but could further reflect on whether formal ‚Äòschool work‚Äô sessions align well with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, or their beliefs about child initiated learning.</p><p>The manager continues to operate the centre effectively. Reviews in 2012 of the centre‚Äôs vision, philosophy and strategic plan have resulted in improved long term planning and better guidance for annual action plans. A recent extensive, external review of the management framework found that operational systems were largely effective. The manager values teachers and provides a generous budget for their ongoing professional development including opportunities for them to enhance their management and leadership skills.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and senior teachers agree with ERO that the next steps for the centre should include:</p><ul>
<li>further planning of teaching strategies, beyond the provision of resources and activities that will extend children's learning</li>
<li>improving the documentation of self-review processes at management level, and refining centre policies</li>
<li>ensuring that the teachers‚Äô appraisal process is rigorous and implemented every year.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Footprints Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Footprints Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
