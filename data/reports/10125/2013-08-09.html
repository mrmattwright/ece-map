</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (14) in Henderson, Auckland, provides full day care and education for up to 100 children from birth to five years of age. Children are organised into five groups and are based in separate rooms in accordance with their stages of learning and development. The centre has up to 40 children under 2 years of age.</p><p>The centre is managed by the long established Kindercare Centres early childhood organisation. The organisation provides administrative and personnel system support. External Kindercare managers also monitor centre practices and give support and guidance to the centre director.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs 2010 ERO report identified positive teaching and learning practices. It recommended that managers use staff performance appraisal and self-review procedures to continue to enhance centre practices. The centre has responded positively to these recommendations. Teacher appraisal systems have improved and now align with the Teacher Registration Criteria. Self review is used as a useful tool for improvement. Staff are currently considering how they can record self review in ways that make goals and outcomes more visible.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and happy. They explore the learning environment confidently, while accessing resources and learning activities independently. Children‚Äôs ongoing wellbeing is maintained through caring and supportive relationships with their teachers. Learning environments have recently been upgraded to allow children to mix more spontaneously with siblings and peers in adjoining indoor and outdoor spaces. Teachers have focused on improving positive learning outcomes for all children, and in particular infants, toddlers and children who are transitioning to school.</p><p>Significant changes have been made since the last ERO review in line with the centre's key focus area on social emotional development. The philosophy and core values of ‚ÄòSafe, Loved and Learning‚Äô reflect increased understandings of how children learn more effectively when being nurtured and cared for in a physically and emotionally safe setting. Self review, research and professional development has influenced positive changes to the way the physical environment and resources are presented and accessed by children. Teachers' interactions with children have been enhanced, and information sharing and partnerships with parents are being strengthened.</p><p>Records demonstrate how children‚Äôs learning is becoming more complex and is being extended over time. Curriculum leaders are continuing to help all staff to understand and embed new approaches into the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers use their first languages and ethnic background knowledge to support children from the diverse community transition into the centre. Some aspects of children‚Äôs cultures are being celebrated culturally within the programme.</p><p>Managers and teachers are aware of the Ministry of Education‚Äôs strategy to support MƒÅori children to become capable and confident learners. They understand the importance of supporting MƒÅori children to learn within their own cultural context. They are working to develop a centre-based strategy to ensure these children experience a meaningful and culturally relevant programme. The strategy appropriately includes working in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Staff have yet to consider to how they can make contact with the Pacific community in order to develop strategies for helping to maintain and promote Pacific children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities.</p><p>Centre management provides staff with many leadership opportunities. Managers themselves receive ongoing external support to further develop and strengthen their expertise and capabilities. The majority of staff are registered teachers. The few who are yet to be fully trained and registered are well supported.</p><p>Comprehensive management, personnel and employment systems are ensuring that the sustainability of the centre is being maintained and improved. Appraisal systems have been improved to align to with current professional practice. Self review is being used effectively to influence the strategic direction of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>Centre managers and teachers should continue to develop and implement strategies that enable MƒÅori children to learn as MƒÅori within the centre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pacific children should be further supported to learn within a context that affirms their cultures, languages and identities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (14) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (14) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>9 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
