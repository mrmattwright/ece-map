<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Shirley Playcentre is one of 46 centres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The association&rsquo;s education and centre support teams provide support for the centre. The parent cooperative is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the playcentre. This playcentre runs five morning sessions for children aged from birth to school age. It also has a well attended and effectively facilitated afternoon session tailored for parents with young babies (Babies Can Play).</p><p align="left">This playcentre has been significantly impacted by the recent Canterbury earthquakes. Part of the outdoor area is fenced off due to the condition of an adjacent building. The parent group has responded well to this challenge by ensuring children have access to an appropriate range of outdoor equipment including a temporary sandpit. There have been changes in the parent group. Some families have left the area due to damage to their homes and others have joined the centre temporarily. The playcentre philosophy of supporting families and wh&#257;nau has been well reflected in their response to the impacts of the earthquakes on children and their families.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>positive and affirming relationships between adults and children, and among adults</li>
<li>the way the programme follows children&rsquo;s interests particularly science and numeracy experiences</li>
<li>how some adults effectively role model the best ways to enhance children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the effective way adults help children learn about playing with others</li>
<li>a spacious and attractive indoor environment with easy access to a wide range of activities and resources.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The parent group works well together to effectively manage the playcentre. Parents regularly undertake training and make good use of parent strengths.</p><p align="left">The next steps are for the association to support more parents to:</p><ul>
<li>identify learning in assessment and planning documentation</li>
<li>use te reo M&#257;ori during sessions</li>
<li>understand how to use self review processes to improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Shirley Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atShirley Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Playcentre philosophy highlights the belief that children reach their full potential when parents understand their development and take part in the learning process. At this playcentre the parent group aim to provide a safe, stimulating, supportive and encouraging environment for children and their families. This philosophy was clearly visible in the centre&rsquo;s practices and operation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Positive and affirming relationships are evident in the playcentre. Children interact confidently with all adults. Adults use praise and encouragement when they talk with children. ERO observed adults supporting each other by giving useful advice and the confidence to contribute to the programme.</p><p align="left">Adults effectively follow children&rsquo;s leads and ideas within the programme. They make good use of children&rsquo;s interests to plan activities and group learning experiences. Adults also recognise and effectively link children&rsquo;s home lives into the programme.</p><p align="left">Adults successfully support children to develop social skills. They help children with group and cooperative play. Children have many opportunities to play with others independent from adults.</p><p align="left">ERO observed some adults who provided good modelling in supporting and extending children&rsquo;s learning. These adults:</p><ul>
<li>worked closely alongside children and took time to have sustained interactions with them</li>
<li>used effective questions to encourage children to extend their ideas</li>
<li>helped children recognise and talk about their thinking processes</li>
<li>celebrated children&rsquo;s successes and efforts through praise and encouragement.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Particular programme strengths were evident in science, and numeracy. Adults also focus on increasing children&rsquo;s knowledge and vocabulary on a variety of topics of interest. Displays which reflect children&rsquo;s involvement in these topics are prominent in the indoor environment.</p><p align="left">The parent group successfully share roles and responsibilities for the management of the playcentre. They work well together to discuss and make improvements to support children&rsquo;s learning. The use of parent strengths is very evident in the programme and environment.</p><p align="left">Adults make good use of the education opportunities provided by the playcentre association. They also seek additional support and education from the wider community.</p><p align="left">An additional session focused on babies and their parents (Babies Can Play) is providing good opportunities for these parents to:</p><ul>
<li>meet other new parents from the local community</li>
<li>learn about child development, the benefits of play, and Te Wh&#257;riki &ndash; the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</li>
<li>find out about playcentre philosophy.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The indoor environment is spacious, well resourced and attractively presented. Children benefit from easy access to a wide range of activities and resources.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The centre has been significantly impacted by the recent Canterbury earthquakes. As well as limiting their access to the outdoor environment this has resulted in changes to the parent group. The next steps for the playcentre association are to support parents in:</p><ul>
<li>identifying children&rsquo;s learning in assessment and planning documentation</li>
<li>using te reo M&#257;ori more during sessions.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The parent group has also identified that they need to increase the number of parents involved in the process of self review to improve their understanding of evaluation.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Shirley Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice the managers should support the parent group to:</p><div><ol>
<li>
<p align="left">become more familiar with association formats for recording medication, documenting excursions and communicating hazards to centre visitors.</p>
</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-shirley-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Shirley Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Shirley Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Shirley Playcentre is one of 46 centres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The association&rsquo;s education and centre support teams provide support for the centre. The parent cooperative is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the playcentre. This playcentre runs five morning sessions for children aged from birth to school age. It also has a well attended and effectively facilitated afternoon session tailored for parents with young babies (Babies Can Play).</p><p align="left">This playcentre has been significantly impacted by the recent Canterbury earthquakes. Part of the outdoor area is fenced off due to the condition of an adjacent building. The parent group has responded well to this challenge by ensuring children have access to an appropriate range of outdoor equipment including a temporary sandpit. There have been changes in the parent group. Some families have left the area due to damage to their homes and others have joined the centre temporarily. The playcentre philosophy of supporting families and wh&#257;nau has been well reflected in their response to the impacts of the earthquakes on children and their families.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>positive and affirming relationships between adults and children, and among adults</li>
<li>the way the programme follows children&rsquo;s interests particularly science and numeracy experiences</li>
<li>how some adults effectively role model the best ways to enhance children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the effective way adults help children learn about playing with others</li>
<li>a spacious and attractive indoor environment with easy access to a wide range of activities and resources.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The parent group works well together to effectively manage the playcentre. Parents regularly undertake training and make good use of parent strengths.</p><p align="left">The next steps are for the association to support more parents to:</p><ul>
<li>identify learning in assessment and planning documentation</li>
<li>use te reo M&#257;ori during sessions</li>
<li>understand how to use self review processes to improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
