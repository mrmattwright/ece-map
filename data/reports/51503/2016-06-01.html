</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taihape Childcare Centre is an established early childhood centre, privately owned and operated by a family trust. The full day education and care centre has been part of the Rangitikei community for many years. Since the April 2014 ERO report, centre leaders and staff have worked positively to address regulatory requirements.</p><p>The centre is licensed for up to 25 children, including ten under two years of age. The current roll is 29, including 21 MƒÅori children. The centre philosophy prioritises empowering children through respectful and positive relationships with them and their families. Children are encouraged to calmly, confidently and creatively make sense of their world.</p><p>The previous ERO report found development was needed particularly in relation to: internal evaluation; developing leadership, teaching and learning through a robust appraisal process; building teachers' understanding of effective assessment, planning and evaluation; and incorporating te ao MƒÅori centre-wide. An action plan was developed to address these areas.</p><p>The teaching team has received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Taihape Childcare Centre has made positive progress in strengthening areas for development identified. Although some developments are ongoing, the service is better placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children experience positive, respectful, warm and caring relationships with teachers. They are inquiring, animated, and confident communicators. There is a supportive, settled tone.</p><p>Children are encouraged and supported to lead their own learning. Their strengths and interests are promoted by teachers. Children engage in sustained conversations with adults, which build and extend their learning. Strategies to effectively support and extend play include knowledge of prior learning, links to home and questioning techniques. A next step is to improve evaluation of teacher actions and responses focused on children's learning outcomes.</p><p>The curriculum prioritises children's sense of belonging through whakapapa and links to the wider world. Literacy and numeracy are emphasised.</p><p>The planning process has been recently revised to better support teachers to understand the learning journey of individual children. Profiles reflect increased use of dispositions, multiple perspectives including child voice, te reo MƒÅori and children's interests over time. Teachers are guided by a set of expectations. A next step is to continue to strengthen the purpose and use of assessment for learning, including:</p><ul>
<li>drawing from current best practices in assessment</li>
<li>inviting and including whƒÅnau voice in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>MƒÅori children have opportunities to achieve success as MƒÅori. All children experience te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori throughout daily teaching. Teachers value and seek parent and whƒÅnau input. Local expertise contributes to the programme. Centre leaders intend building teacher understanding of culturally responsive practice.</p><p>A positive, collaborative team culture is evident. The head teacher promotes distributed leadership. Professional learning and development has built teacher capability. Teachers take responsibility for review and development. ERO's evaluation agrees with leaders that further developing appraisal practice should help build teachers' capability.</p><p>Through strategic, planned and emergent self review teachers and managers gather information to support decisions about service direction, priorities and improved learning outcomes for children. WhƒÅnau and parents are consulted and have opportunities to contribute. ERO affirms that ongoing development of internal evaluation to improve teacher knowledge and understanding is likely to be beneficial.</p><p>Areas of noncompliance noted in the previous report have been addressed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that the next development steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the purpose and use of planning and assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement the appraisal process to further improve the quality of feedback to develop teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> to build capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the distributed leadership approach.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taihape Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taihape Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
