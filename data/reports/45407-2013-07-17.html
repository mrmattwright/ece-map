<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the UrbanKids Early Learning Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the July 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality and consistency of programme planning, implementation, evaluation and assessment</li>
<li>the extent to which teaching interactions promote positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>the effectiveness of self review in improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>the provision for effective support, guidance and professional learning opportunities for teachers</li>
<li>the extent to which centre practices promote partnerships with parents and a recognition of children&rsquo;s language, culture and ethnic identity</li>
<li>management&rsquo;s response to the health and safety concerns and areas of non-compliance identified in the July 2012 ERO report.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>UrbanKids Early Learning Centre is located in the suburb of Brookfield, in Tauranga. The service caters for up to 75 children, including up to 25 children under the age of two. The centre is organised into four age-group areas. It employs a high proportion of staff who are qualified early childhood teachers, and most other staff are training towards a teaching qualification. A new centre manager was appointed in February 2013. Other features of the leadership structure are currently under review.</p><p>Management and teachers have made substantial progress since the last review. The centre manager has worked closely with teachers to develop more collegial ways of working, and to increase the opportunities for them to contribute to decision-making and take responsibility for programme planning and self review.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Effective professional leadership is significantly improving teaching practice and outcomes for children. Centre programmes emphasise child-centred learning. Planning and assessment processes recognise children&rsquo;s individual learning needs, and acknowledge their social and cultural backgrounds. Teachers share their knowledge of children&rsquo;s learning through weekly written reflections. Together they plan weekly programmes to include activities and experiences that respond to children&rsquo;s deep interests in meaningful contexts. These plans are displayed for teachers and parents, along with photographs and stories that illustrate children&rsquo;s involvement and learning. Individual learning portfolios are available for parents and children to share. They contain learning stories that revisit children&rsquo;s earlier interests to show progress and development.</p><p>Teachers have positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. Language development is fostered appropriately in each of the age groups. Teachers hold sustained conversations with children that respect their points of view. They provide positive guidance that helps children to solve conflicts and maintain friendships. Teachers actively promote cooperative play and enable children to explore and make choices. Babies are encouraged to move freely and enjoy a wide range of activities. Teachers recognise that consistency and continuity are important in establishing a secure foundation for young children&rsquo;s care and education.</p><p>Self review is valued and used effectively to improve the quality of education and care. The manager and teachers constantly reflect on their practice, discuss centre priorities and decisions that affect their practice. Relevant professional development about self review is increasing leadership and teacher capabilities. The centre evaluates the effectiveness of any changes made to centre practice as a result of self-review projects.</p><p>The directors and centre manager responsible for governing and managing the service have a good understanding of, and capability to carry out, their roles and responsibilities. Teachers are well supported by:</p><ul>
<li>relevant professional development and learning opportunities</li>
<li>regular team meetings to discuss their practice and seek advice and guidance</li>
<li>frequent opportunities to take ownership of programme development and to contribute to decision-making.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers feel valued, are increasingly motivated to enhance their teaching practice, and are responding positively to the centre manager&rsquo;s high expectations. The directors and manager have identified that there is a need to review teacher job descriptions and staff appraisals to incorporate teacher registration criteria.</p><p>Parents spoken to by ERO feel welcome in the centre and find teachers approachable and friendly. Parents and wh&#257;nau have opportunities to be actively involved in their children&rsquo;s learning, and in centre events and excursions. Their views are valued, and they feel well informed about their children&rsquo;s wellbeing and progress.</p><p>The centre has addressed the concerns about compliance identified in the 2012 ERO report and teachers conduct daily health and safety checks.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that their next steps are to develop a strategic plan, and a linked annual action plan, that reflects the service's vision and provides direction for ongoing development of the centre.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of UrbanKids Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 July 2013</p><a id="3-information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Information about the Service</h2><table>
