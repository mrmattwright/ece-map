</table><p>The preschool no longer operates as a Montessori centre. It has no fully trained Montessori teachers. It has been through a time of transition with several changes of staff in recent months and a new management committee. The committee initially sought support from the Ministry of Education in 2013 to assist it in clarifying roles and responsibilities. The service still needs support to further develop the centre philosophy, curriculum and policies. A number of key management systems and practices have not yet been developed or are in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Peel Forest Montessori Preschool is a small, rural community-based centre. Children attending are from two years to school age. The preschool is open four days a week and employs three qualified early childhood teachers. A new teaching team has been in place since the beginning of Term 4, 2013.</p><p>The centre is administered by a small group of parents who are elected annually and who form the management committee. The committee recognizes and values external input and has contracted an adviser to provide the preschool with continued professional support and guidance. The committee and teachers are working towards relicensing the preschool to meet the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ERO observed happy, settled and social children. They play well together for long periods of time, particularly enjoying the outdoor environment. Teachers nurture children and encourage respectful relationships. They engage children in easy conversation with warm, respectful relationships evident.</p><p>Teachers actively encourage children to develop their ideas, use their imagination and develop their oral language skills. The supervisor provides a good role model for her team in the way she supports children to make choices and solve problems.</p><p>Children were confident and fully engaged in their play. The indoor and outdoor areas are well resourced and easy for children to use. The natural outdoor environment encourages children‚Äôs exploration and the development of physical skills.</p><p>New initiatives are encouraging children to develop leadership skills, know their opinions are valued and increase their ability to take responsibility for their belongings and personal care routines. Examples of this are the way children lead karakia at kai times and how their views influence decisions about the organisation of the inside environment.</p><p>The supervisor and teachers are developing a positive team culture where one another‚Äôs strengths are recognised and valued. The supervisor has a good knowledge of the early childhood curriculum and the direction she wants to take the team. Together with the external adviser, priorities have been set and an action plan has been developed. In partnership with the preschool‚Äôs parent community, some good progress has been in moving towards achieving set goals.</p><p>The new management committee has taken a number of positive steps to promote the growth and improvement of the preschool. Committee members recognised the preschool was in crisis and that they needed to make changes. They responded positively by:</p><ul>
<li>employing a new supervisor and teacher</li>
<li>developing clear roles and responsibilities for committee members</li>
<li>writing appropriate job descriptions and tasks for staff</li>
<li>working on shared understanding and processes for financial management</li>
<li>beginning to clarify and document the preschool‚Äôs philosophy</li>
<li>committing to support and guidance from an independent external adviser.</li>
</ul><p>The new supervisor and management committee have established a good working relationship. The management committee and teaching team expressed their motivation and enthusiasm for moving the preschool forward and the possibilities this presents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management committee and teachers know there is still considerable work to do and have begun this process. In order to improve the preschool‚Äôs operation, there is an urgent need to:</p><ul>
<li>establish a philosophy and vision for the centre</li>
<li>define a curriculum that meets the philosophy and aligns with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</li>
<li>continue to develop and consistently use operational policies, procedures and practices; in particular, financial management, teacher appraisal and self review</li>
<li>establish assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning that clearly links to the preschool‚Äôs philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></li>
<li>
<p style="display: inline !important;">continue to work towards meeting the requirements of the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Peel Forest Montessori Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and the curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas.</p><ol>
<li>Management and educators should use policies, objectives and practices which reflect the service‚Äôs philosophy, quality curriculum, and current theories of learning and development.</li>
<li>Management should use personnel policies which promote quality practices including staff appraisal and professional development for both management and educators.¬†<em>[Revised Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices (DOPs) for Chartered Early Childhood Services 10(a), 11(a)]</em></li>
</ol><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Peel Forest Montessori Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 March 2014</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.¬†</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
