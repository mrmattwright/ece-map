</table><p>Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue needs support to develop the quality of its curriculum programme and the effectiveness of governance and management.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue is a Pacific early childhood centre located in Mangere, Auckland. The centre aims to nurture children's Niuean language and culture. Children from birth to six years of age attend. Children are mainly Niuean, but there are also children of MƒÅori, Samoan and PƒÅkehƒÅ descent.</p><p>Most of the staff are qualified teachers or are in training for these qualifications. Since the previous review in 2013, new staff have been appointed.</p><p>Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue has a history of three consecutive supplementary reviews since 2011. The ERO 2013 report identified the need to improve planning for children up to two years of age and to support older children's interests. It also identified that teachers should document individual children's learning progress and encourage children to develop problem-solving skills. The centre has made minimal progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue needs support to further develop the quality of the curriculum programme and urgently improve the effectiveness of governance and management.</p><p>The centre provides a basic curriculum that needs to be more responsive to children's interests and strengths. Teachers provide a range of activities to help children learn through their play. There are opportunities for children up to two years of age to participate in mixed-age play. The separate under two play area could be further enhanced to provide children with a more stimulating environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration.</p><p>Niuean culture is valued in the learning environment. Teachers model Niuean language and children's use of this language is encouraged and supported, particularly during mat times. Most staff are fluent speakers of Niuean. Children and their teachers have opportunities to participate in cultural and community events.</p><p>Children have opportunities to develop their literacy skills through integrated approaches. Children and their parents are building their awareness of healthy eating and physical activity. Positive changes are reflected in children's healthy lunches because of this focus.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have undertaken professional development in leadership, planning and learning stories. There has been minimal impact in improving teacher capability as a result of this.</p><p>Centre leaders agree that further external professional support is needed. This should be focused on helping teachers to develop their understanding of current professional practice and ERO's framework for reviewing early childhood services <em>He Pou Tataki</em>. Teachers should document a regular cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation that records their response to children's interests and dispositions. This ongoing process should show how children's learning is promoted and extended.</p><p>ERO has serious concerns regarding the centre's financial management and its ongoing sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers should access appropriate professional development to improve curriculum leadership and the implementation of an emergent curriculum. This external support should help teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve assessment, planning and evaluation and provision for children's interests, strengths and abilities through play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the quality of provision of an appropriate programme for children up to two years of age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' professional capability and teaching practice through critical reflection and effective self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase children's access to a wide range of challenging and natural learning resources for their creative and explorative play.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The appraisal system needs to be updated to effectively guide the required development in teaching practice to improve outcomes for children. The process should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>observations of practice and written feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evidential records in relation to the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>external appraisal for the centre manager.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Strategic planning needs strengthening so that there is direction for development priorities. The centre manager and teachers need to establish a shared understanding of the connections between planned outcomes and internal evaluation. This would assist them to make connections between goals and actions and their impact on outcomes for children. Internal evaluation needs to include indicators of effective practice that promote ongoing improvement within the centre.</p><p>Matakau Niue Fiti Laga (Trust Board) receive reports on finance and centre events. However, the centre's governance should more effectively promote positive outcomes for children. The board needs to review centre policies and procedures on a regular cycle and the process needs to be more robust and inclusive of teachers and parents.</p><p>Board members should build an understanding of the <em>Vulnerable Children's Act (2014)</em> and incorporate these requirements into relevant policies and appointment procedures. The centre manager needs support to carry out her responsibilities related to overseeing and promoting good quality service provision for children and their families.</p><p>Priorities for the board and management include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring effective financial management practices that promote the centre's viability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintaining documented self review, strategic and annual planning and resourcing that is focused on improving outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing relevant human resource management policies and processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to curriculum, governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective governance and management in accordance with good management practices, including self-review practices, appraisal and police vetting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>managing excursions outside the centre in order to meet health and safety regulations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adults understanding of children's development and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA and Curriculum C2</em>.</p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fiti Lagakali Aoga Niue will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
