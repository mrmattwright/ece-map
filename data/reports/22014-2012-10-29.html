<html><a id="page-15039" class="toc-anchor"></a><h1><span style="font-size: 10px;">&nbsp;</span></h1><a id="early-childhood-service-education-review-report-waimauku-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Early Childhood Service Education Review Report: Waimauku Playcentre</h2><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. We work with early childhood services to identify their strengths and the areas they need to review and develop. Early childhood services take part in the review process and are expected to make use of the findings to enhance children's learning and wellbeing.</p><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The Waimauku Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Context</h4><p>Waimauku Playcentre is co-operatively managed by members who are the families of the children who are enrolled. It operates within the Te Akoranga Playcentre Association which provides support personnel, parent education, and a framework for centre management.</p><p>The centre currently runs four morning sessions per week, with an expectation that children will attend at least two of these sessions. Parents attend sessions with their children and complete management tasks to ensure the smooth running of the centre.</p><h4>The Review Findings</h4><p>The high ratio of adults to children ensures that there are many opportunities for children to be supported in their play. Members interact with their own children and with others, talking with them and helping them access resources.</p><p>Members recognise the value of allowing children to direct their own play and to develop independence. Older children are encouraged to plan activities and choose the resources that they will use. Children make decisions about their play in collaboration with other children and with adults.</p><p>Parents conduct significant self review and plan strategically to support ongoing improvement for the Playcentre. Self reviews follow a planned process that enables all parents to participate in decision making. The outcomes of changes made as a result of these reviews are evaluated and serve as a basis for ongoing improvement in the centre.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO review, parents have made significant progress in improving their Playcentre qualifications. Many more now have Level 3 qualifications and so they are able to supervise sessions. Many parents have Level 2 qualifications and are on courses to gain Level 3.</p><p>A much higher percentage of families attend two sessions a week than was the case two years ago. The centre reports that this has resulted in increased contribution and commitment from parents, and happier and more settled children who are achieving better learning outcomes.</p><p>Members have also improved the provision for children less than two years of age. They have put strategies in place to support those who have young children with older siblings at the session. They continue to review how well the Playcentre provides for younger children and are planning sessions where the younger children are the focus. They are also planning sessions that focus on helping older children prepare for school.</p><p>Members are clear about their intended curriculum outcomes and plan the programme accordingly. Curriculum goals include developing resilience, self reliance, problem solving, empathy, and good social and communication skills.</p><p>Early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge are supported within the programme. Parents share books with children and there are opportunities for children to write. The centre programme is enhanced by visitors and visits within and beyond the Waimauku community.</p><p>Each morning session is evaluated at its conclusion. Part of this evaluation identifies the learning that took place for individuals and groups. The effectiveness of activities is considered and planning for future sessions is discussed. These evaluations help to ensure continuity between sessions.</p><p>The centre is well supported to promote success for M&#257;ori children and to develop bicultural awareness for all children. Two M&#257;ori members are sharing their knowledge and ideas with other parents and the wider Te Akoranga Association. Tikanga M&#257;ori relevant to the centre has been identified and is being documented. Te reo M&#257;ori is visible in the centre and some is used when talking with children. Wh&#257;nau report that they feel welcome, included, and empowered to support the development of the centre.</p><p>The Playcentre has made many improvements over the last two years. The challenge now is to ensure that the good practices now in place are sustained over time. The centre is well placed to meet the challenge.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waimauku Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>29 October 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>Review focus</h4><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h4>Disclaimer</h4><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
