</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukekohe High School Childcare Centre is a well-established service. It serves the wider community to provide education and care for up to 33 children, including eight up to the age of two. While there is a separate area for infants and toddlers, they frequently mix with older children. Over 60 percent of the children are Pākehā, 15 percent are Māori and 15 percent are from other cultures, including African, Asian and other European cultures.</p><p>The centre is governed by the committee of an incorporated society. The manager and centre leaders share responsibility for the day-to-day routines and programmes. The teaching team is made up of long serving and new teachers, all of whom are qualified and registered.</p><p>The centre philosophy places importance on nurturing children's individual learning and promoting a strong sense of self. It also promotes a strong focus on partnerships with parents and whānau. The centre is well maintained. Leaders identify challenges in extending the outdoor play area and incorporating more information and communication technologies into daily programmes.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. A well implemented action plan aligned to the strategic plan helped the committee and centre leaders respond positively to the areas for development in the 2012 report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of responsibility as they play. They work collaboratively with their peers at different activities that challenge their thinking. They take learning risks, solve problems and hold sustained conversations as they explore new and old ideas. They have lots of fun and enjoy each other's company.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for very well. Teachers help children to reach their developmental milestones and explore their environment. Children respond to the warm affectionate approaches of the teachers. The calm and gentle environment provides security for the children who discover new interests each day.</p><p>Teachers unobtrusively monitor children as they enjoy many different activities and learning tasks. They support children as they make decisions and pose questions to extend learning in the play roles that the children adopt. Teachers promote positive behaviour with children and encourage them with calmness and care.</p><p>The relationships between children and teachers are rich with experiences. Early literacy and numeracy are strategically interwoven in the context of play and into the conversations that teachers have with children. This meaningful learning supports children to develop strong social skills and prepare for their future learning in schools.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and parents are a strength of the centre. Parents have a strong voice in the centre and they hold the teachers in high regard. They share aspirations for their children with teachers who write very good learning stories about children at play. Parents know teachers have strong trusting relationships with their children, who are becoming more confident to manage complex situations independently.</p><p>Bicultural Aotearoa New Zealand and the diversity of the community are strongly reflected in the learning programmes. Children get along well with each other and share their cultures. Teachers use te reo Māori as part of daily routines and children take home games and songs with cultural themes to share with their families. The role of tuakana/teina is valued in the centre with children moving freely between rooms to connect with older and younger siblings and friends.</p><p>The centre manager is very experienced and promotes shared leadership within her team. She oversees the cycle to review systems and strategies, and the rigorous appraisal policy and process that supports teacher accountability. The parent committee supports professional learning opportunities for staff development and is proactive in promoting the centre in the local community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on their very good practices, centre leaders agree they could consider:</p><ul>
<li>documenting their self review to provide ongoing points of reference for continual improvement</li>
<li>further developing their SMARTgoals to reflect progress over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukekohe High School Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukekohe High School Childcare Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 June 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
