</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Crackerjacks Preschool Ltd Juniors' philosophy puts the child at the centre of learning. The service aims to assist all children to develop warm, loving, caring relationships. They have many opportunities to initiate play, extend their own interests, and be confident and independent learners. Consultation with Ngati Maniapoto Trust Board has resulted in a review of the service philosophy and a stronger focus on te reo and tikanga Maniapoto in teaching practice.</p><p>The service is privately owned and provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age. There are two separate licences on the same site with separate areas for babies, toddlers and young children. The centre is open from 7.30am to 5.45pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The knowledgeable licensee-owner takes an active role in the centres' administration and has a strong commitment to the education and wellbeing of young children. She has high expectations for teaching and learning, and provides effective professional support and guidance for staff.</p><p>The centre manager is responsible for the day to day administration of both licences and is currently the acting team leader of the toddler area. She is an enthusiastic and capable leader with a strong focus on positive outcomes for children. There are two experienced team leaders in the babies' and young children's areas.</p><p>Respectful and collaborative relationships exist among children, parents and whƒÅnau, and staff. Parents appreciate that teachers provide their children with a learning environment that is enjoyable, friendly and inclusive. They value the ability to be flexible about children's hours of attendance when required.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies settle quickly in a warm, welcoming and calm environment. They explore and make sense of the world around them as they experiment with movement, language, and a variety of resources. Babies enjoy many opportunities to interact and build strong attachments with teachers, particularly those who are their primary carers.</p><p>Teachers have a very good understanding of babies' developmental needs and deliberately plan to build and extend their emotional, physical and intellectual growth. They skilfully recognise babies' early attempts at talking and sounds, and use a variety of strategies to respond to their changing needs and preferences. Frequent conversations with parents and whƒÅnau provide teachers with vital information to support babies' engagement and learning.</p><p>Toddlers are highly engaged in an environment that provides a wide range of activities that stimulate and challenge them. They have easy access to both inside and outside resources. Toddlers are free to safely use equipment as and where they wish to support and extend their understandings about the world around them.</p><p>Teachers interact with toddlers to promote their confidence and independence as they explore the environment. Teachers notice what children are interested in and follow up with meaningful activities that contribute to their learning. They model new language for toddlers and give them time to respond and converse.</p><p>Children are recognised as independent learners who have the capability to understand their own needs. They lead their own learning, develop friendships, and have the confidence to decide when they are ready to move into the next area of the centre.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate cultural sensitivity and recognise all parents and whƒÅnau as contributing members of the centre community. MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau appreciate their language and culture being valued and shared through daily karakia, waiata and respect for tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Centre leaders have worked with teachers to further develop their knowledge of the extent of mathematics learning. They have had professional development in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and how these areas are integrated into children's learning. Children experience mathematics as an enjoyable part of learning, related to their world.</p><p>A clear framework for monitoring children's progress and learning assists teachers to evaluate children's development. Regular and frequent recorded observations about children's learning support teachers to effectively plan purposeful activities. Six-monthly summary progress reports are shared with parents in personal portfolios.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have implemented highly effective self-review procedures and practices. They have a shared understanding about the purpose of self review. Reviews are well planned and used to inform decision making and improve the quality of care and education for young children. A robust appraisal process invites teachers to reflect on their practice and set performance goals focused on promoting positive outcomes for young children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A feature of the centre is an ongoing commitment to a sustainable curriculum. Centre leaders have identified that it is essential to continue to develop teachers' professional leadership capabilities and bicultural practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Crackerjacks Pre-School Ltd Juniors completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Crackerjacks Pre-School Ltd Juniors will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern</p><p>5 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
