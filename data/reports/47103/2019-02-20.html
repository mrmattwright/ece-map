</table><p>Kereru Kindy - Huapai¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.¬†</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kereru Kindy - Huapai opened in October 2016 and is located in West Auckland. It is one of three centres owned and governed by Jenbryce Enterprises Limited. The centre provides education and care for children over two years of age, and is licensed for up to 23 children. The service operates in a modified residential house on a large section. It provides a spacious and interesting learning environment for children.</p><p>The philosophy for the centre identifies a commitment to providing an environment that inspires adventure play, and where children are encouraged to take risks in a safe environment. It recognises the importance of working in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau in respectful and reciprocal ways. Empowering children and supporting children's independence, self-confidence and love of learning are at the heart of the centre's philosophy.</p><p>The centre owners and staff work collaboratively. The teaching team is led by an experienced head teacher. The majority of staff are registered teachers.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported well to be confident and capable learners. They settle quickly and have a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. Children lead the direction of their play, and freely choose activities based on their interests. The outside area provides very well for physical challenge, encourages exploration and fosters children's curiosity.</p><p>Teachers are highly effective in developing children's independence, and take time to genuinely listen to, and talk with children. Teachers encourage problem-solving. They empower children to take responsibility for the environment, their own wellbeing and that of others. They know the children well and use teaching practices that enhance children's sense of themselves as successful learners.</p><p>Children experience a well-established learning environment. It is high quality, and thoughtfully designed to affirm and celebrate children‚Äôs interests and extend their learning experiences. Natural resources are highly valued and are used creatively throughout the centre.</p><p>Teachers offer a curriculum that is well designed and responsive to individual children's interests, strengths and abilities. Children are involved in leading and contributing to the programme. Children's learning in core curriculum areas, such as literacy and mathematics, is enriched in meaningful ways that engage children. Teachers write high quality learning stories that reflect the interesting and challenging learning opportunities provided for children.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau have access to very good information about the centre's programme. Well-documented assessment portfolios and planning and assessment wall displays inform them about their children's learning progress. They also inform parents about early childhood education principles and best practice. Parents and whƒÅnau are regularly consulted, and have opportunities to contribute to the evaluation of programmes for their children.</p><p>Tikanga MƒÅori concepts and te reo MƒÅori are reflected in the programme and environment. Teachers empower children to use te reo, and to incorporate their own cultures into their learning.</p><p>The centre is well led and governed. Leaders promote a shared understanding of the centre's philosophy, vision and goals. They encourage emergent leadership. Leaders and teachers participate in good quality professional learning, and are well supported by an external, experienced mentor. Teachers and leaders ensure that their practice reflects the rights of all children to high quality and inclusive early childhood education.</p><p>Internal evaluation is very well understood and is used effectively to inform ongoing improvement. The centre has a very good policy framework, and uses the Kereru Kindy organisation's systems to guide its overall operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers are using internal evaluation well to identify appropriate next steps for sustaining and building on current highly effective practices. These include exploring ways to extend culturally responsible teaching practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kereru Kindy - Huapai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kereru Kindy - Huapai will be in four years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
