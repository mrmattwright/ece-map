</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Moira Gallagher Kindergarten is located in Porirua, near Wellington, and is licensed for 40 children aged from two to five years. The service offers six hour sessions each weekday. Of the 55 children enrolled, 23 are MƒÅori and 17 identify as Pacific.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with community agencies to support children's participation in the kindergarten programme. Since the May 2012 ERO report redevelopment of the outdoors and increased use of digital technologies enhances the learning environment for children and families.</p><p>Moira Gallagher Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Moira Gallagher Kindergarten identified that teachers should, through planned review, continue to investigate ways to involve parents in the programme and assessment for learning. Areas where the association could strengthen its support for teachers were also identified, and positive progress has occurred. The alignment of individual kindergartens‚Äô annual plans with the association‚Äôs strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p><p>All five teachers at the kindergarten are qualified. Three staff hold full registration and two are provisionally registered. The teaching team is supported by the head teacher who has been in her role for several years.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy supports children to be respectful, resilient, confident, competent learners. Teachers value building positive relationships with children and whƒÅnau within the diverse cultures of the centre's community.</p><p>Children‚Äôs active exploration is stimulated and supported. Children take increased responsibility for their own learning. Routines are flexible and adults follow the child‚Äôs lead, with a varied, holistic curriculum. Teachers are nurturing and successfully support the development of children‚Äôs social skills and independence.</p><p>Emerging interest in literacy and numeracy are encouraged. An on-line programme increasingly records teachers' and parents‚Äô communication about children‚Äôs learning, progress and achievements. Teachers view each family and its knowledge of their child as an important part of the kindergarten‚Äôs learning community.</p><p>Staff effectively support children with additional language and development needs. These learners participate in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers. Teachers identify and work hard to remove barriers to a child's full acceptance, participation and learning.</p><p>Teachers' actions and responses thoughtfully encourage the participation, attendance and engagement of MƒÅori and Pacific children and their families. A clear vision that seeks to realise the potential of children and their whƒÅnau, sets the direction for the kindergarten. Aroha, maia, tangata, ahurea, whanaungatanga and tikanga MƒÅori continue to be successfully embedded within teaching and learning.</p><p>Teachers use deliberate strategies to support the success of Pacific children and engage with their families. The curriculum clearly reflects parents‚Äô aspirations for their children. Inclusive, culturally responsive practices encourage whƒÅnau and aiga to bring their cultural identity into the curriculum.</p><p>A well-considered approach to supporting transition into and out of the kindergarten meets individual children‚Äôs needs. Teachers have developed a close partnership with the adjacent school. They continue to establish and build links with other schools.</p><p>The supportive head teacher collaboratively leads her team. The teaching team is well supported by the senior teacher to use internal evaluation that maintain a focus on providing a safe and appropriate learning environment. Continued improvement and change in the kindergarten enhances outcomes for children.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal process. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next step for Moira Gallagher Kindergarten:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop shared understandings of internal evaluation to embed assessment, planning and evaluation practices to guide future teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice and strengthening of responsiveness to MƒÅori children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Moira Gallagher Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Moira Gallagher Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>9 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
