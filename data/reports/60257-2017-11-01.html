</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>William Booth Educare is one of four early learning services in the North Island, owned and operated by The Salvation Army. It is situated on the campus of The Salvation Army Booth College of Mission in Upper Hutt and licensed to cater for 25 children, including a maximum of five aged under two years. Almost all children enrolled are aged over two. Five identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Christian values, respect for children and relationships with families are emphasised in the philosophy.</p><p>Governance is provided through a management committee of The Salvation Army personnel, including a director with responsibility for oversight and support of centre administration. An early childhood education consultant is employed by The Salvation Army to professionally support supervisors and their teaching teams. Day-to-day management is delegated to a centre supervisor. Since the previous ERO review, there have been some staff and leadership changes.</p><p>The June 2014 ERO report identified areas requiring development. These included leadership, teacher practice, the bicultural curriculum, and transition-to-school processes. Progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children freely access resources to lead their own learning. There are extensive opportunities for construction, creativity and imaginative exploration. Teachers warmly engage with children and support them in their play. The recently redeveloped outdoor area effectively promotes physical activity and challenge. A useful focus on health, wellbeing and environmental sustainability is evident. Teachers support children with diverse learning needs, liaising with parents and external agencies as appropriate. Cultural and community events as well as Christian celebrations enrich the curriculum.</p><p>The mixed-age setting is well managed. Children up to two years explore alongside their older peers. Teachers promote tuakana teina (older supporting younger) learning opportunities between children. Infants and toddlers are offered spaces where they can safely play while retaining connections with the wider group. Designated 'guardian teachers' liaise closely with parents, to support children's wellbeing by retaining their routines from home. Positive relationships between teachers and parents are evident.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are valued by teaching staff. Recent work in this area facilitated through a Ministry of Education initiative, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities, has effectively increased the visibility of te reo in the environment and documentation. A next step is for leaders and teachers to explore current research and strategies around actively promoting the educational success of MƒÅori children.</p><p>Learning stories provide an account of children‚Äôs activities and friendships. Teachers observe children and get to know them and their families well. However, the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation requires significant development. Teachers should be supported to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consider the purpose and use of learning portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use assessment information to plan and implement appropriate next learning steps to extend and challenge children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show how purposeful teaching strategies directly impact on children‚Äôs progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gather, use and regularly revisit parents‚Äô aspirations for their children's learning, including cultural aspirations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers provide well-considered resources to parents to build their understanding of children's school readiness. A next step is to develop processes and resources to deliberately support children‚Äôs confidence and wellbeing as they approach their transition to school.</p><p>Teachers collaborate on self reviews that result in improvements for children. They engage with relevant stakeholders and best-practice research to inform decisions about change. Leaders agree that the evaluative aspect of reviews requires strengthening. Robust internal evaluations of practice should involve a narrowed focus and measureable indicators of success. Indicators will support teachers to revisit and clearly measure the impact of changes made.</p><p>Appraisal processes need attention. Leaders should develop and implement explicit guidelines for meaningful appraisal. To meet requirements and develop the professional practice of staff, the approach should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the setting of SMART goals and targeted observations of teacher practice related to these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the collection of evidence to show how teaching standards are met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>constructive feedback and feed forward.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the centre would benefit from increased support from The Salvation Army. This should include regular, formalised visits from the National Consultant, Early Childhood Education, focused on the progression of the priorities for improvement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transition-to-school processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promotion of educational success of MƒÅori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Salvation Army William Booth Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Salvation Army William Booth Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>1 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
