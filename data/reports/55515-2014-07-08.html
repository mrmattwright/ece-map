</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nurtured @ Rascals is one of three local, family owned centres in central Hastings. The centre opened in 2009 and is licensed for 22 children all over the age of two. It is open from 8.00 am until 5.00 pm Monday to Friday and caters for children who mainly identify as NZ/European Pākehā or Māori.</p><p>This is the second ERO education review of this centre.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Rascals owner-operated early childhood centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The positive features identified in the December 2011 ERO report have been sustained. Children are nurtured at this home-away-from-home. The suitably adapted house contributes to the family atmosphere. The teaching team has been together for several years and has come to know the children and their families very well.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships and these are positively reflected in the culture of the centre. Their knowledge of children’s needs, interests and family aspirations contributes to promoting positive outcomes for each child.</p><p>The curriculum has strong links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children’s self esteem is fostered. They are encouraged to explore and follow their interests. Children are challenged and supported to become independent learners.</p><p>Respectful, collaborative practices result in a calm, nurturing atmosphere where children, parents and families feel welcome and valued.</p><p>The design of the welcoming and vibrant learning environment is well considered. A wide selection of resources and curriculum related activities enables uninterrupted play. Children actively engage in learning experiences and activities.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are warm and positive. Children are supported to resolve conflict and this contributes to their relating well and playing cooperatively.</p><p>Extended conversations, open questions and rich number and language resources facilitate the development of literacy and numeracy.</p><p>For each of the children, teachers create portfolios that include photographs, narratives and reflective comments about their observations. These books are an informative record for parents and staff and a special resource for children. Teachers’ thoughtful planning for the programme arises out of what they know about the children’s interests and family aspirations.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate respect for children’s diverse needs. The centre respects, values and uses the knowledge parents have of their child’s learning, development and achievement to contribute to special education plans. Teachers, when appropriate, also draw on support from external agencies.</p><p>A high proportion of the children identify as Māori. These children are fully included in the programme. Teachers have identified the need to continue to develop their knowledge of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. The next step is to implement the centre’s Treaty of Waitangi policy to provide an even more culturally inclusive environment.</p><p>Transitions children make into the centre are carefully planned and monitored. There are also suitable processes to support parents and their children as they prepare for the transition to education at school.</p><p>The owner and manager are focused on improvement. They support teachers to promote positive outcomes for children. The management plan ensures key governance areas are regularly considered and addressed. Policies are appropriately structured to inform parents and guide teachers.</p><p>Self review is developing and aspects are evident in the centre. The next step is to develop and implement a more strategic approach to support ongoing improvement.</p><p>Teachers think about their practice and collaboratively discuss strategies. They draw on outside sources for their professional development to grow their knowledge. The owner now needs to develop and implement a suitable system of appraisal that is implemented regularly for all staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers should continue to promote whānau partnerships, use more te reo Māori and extend bicultural practices in the programme.</p><p>The owner and centre manager should develop and implement a more strategic approach to self review to support ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nurtured @ Rascals completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should ensure that suitable human resource management practices are implemented by developing:</p><ul>
<li>a system of regular appraisal. [Sources: <em>Reg.47, Governance, management and administration standard: general (1)(e)] Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GM 7 Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 2008: ]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nurtured @ Rascals will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>8 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
