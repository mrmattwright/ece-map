</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Martinborough Playcentre is licensed to provide mixed-age education and care for 30 children, three sessions a week. This includes provision for 15 children aged up to two years. At the time of the review there are 26 children enrolled.</p><p>During 2018, playcentres are transitioning from operating as 32 regional associations to becoming one national body, Playcentre Aotearoa. In the lower North Island eight associations have merged into a region renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Lower North Island Region. Playcentre Aotearoa is governed nationally through an annual general meeting and a trustee board that reflects the organisation‚Äôs bicultural partnership model. The board includes equal membership from a general Tangata Tiriti caucus and Te Whare Tikanga MƒÅori, a group of consisting of whƒÅnau MƒÅori.</p><p>The philosophy of Playcentre Aotearoa, 'WhƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together', is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. Alongside this, the centre's philosophy acknowledges that, 'it takes a village to raise a child'.</p><p>A centre support worker and an administrator are employed to visit playcentres and provide professional advice and support, and to promote improvement. For Martinborough Playcentre, the region‚Äôs centre support co-ordinator and te ao MƒÅori field worker are yet to be appointed. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by parent members who are office holders. Each session is supported by a team of parent educators who hold, or are working towards, Playcentre Education Awards.</p><p>Prior to 2018, little support was being provided to members at Martinborough Playcentre. New support staff acknowledge the need to prioritise this centres contact and monitoring to improve some areas of practice. At the time of this review, support was in the beginning stages.</p><p>The January 2015 ERO report for Martinborough Playcentre identified areas for development for the centre and the former Wairarapa Association. These included internal evaluation and the bicultural curriculum. Progress in these areas is ongoing.</p><p>This is one of a cluster of two playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Lower North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Members have successfully maintained a positive learning environment for children during periods of reduced association support. They collaborate as a whƒÅnau and work respectfully alongside their own and other children to support their learning and wellbeing. New families are welcomed through inclusive practices. A focus on community support is given priority and clearly evident.</p><p>Children confidently lead their learning in an inviting, richly resourced environment. They freely access resources and experiences that have been purposefully chosen by themselves or by adults, to support their emerging interests. There are opportunities for active physical play and challenge. Literacy, mathematics and science learning are woven through the curriculum, in play-based contexts. Children with diverse learning needs are supported to engage with the programme.</p><p>The mixed-age setting is well managed by parents, who sensitively support infants and toddlers to interact with their older peers. Parents are responsive to children's communication and cues. Care routines are warm and respectful. Children of all ages display a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Children benefit from aspects of kaupapa MƒÅori in the curriculum. Plans are in place to build members' knowledge through whƒÅnau expertise, Playcentre Aotearoa support and professional learning with local iwi. This should support the centre to develop culturally responsive practices that support tamariki MƒÅori and enact a localised bicultural curriculum, unique to Martinborough Playcentre.</p><p>Adults document useful observations and analyses of children's individual and group interests. These are used to plan activities that allow children to revisit experiences. Members are alert to the valuable learning opportunities within play experiences, and usefully link assessment documentation to learning dispositions and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. A next step is to plan strategies that challenge children to extend their learning. As the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation develops, regional staff should support members to use cultural information to further strengthen their response.</p><p>At a regional level, clear roles and expectations for centre support staff have been established. These include building effective internal evaluation practices at centre level. A more evaluative approach, including reporting more deliberately about impacts for children should assist both centre and regional personnel to know how well planned actions improve outcomes for all.</p><p>The organisation has useful monitoring and reporting systems, and with clarified support and management roles, these are likely to promote improvements. A good range of communication strategies is in place to inform whƒÅnau of ongoing changes and invite their input. Some current policies and processes remain in place until new systems are implemented nationally. An emphasis on establishing consistency and efficiency, to better support effective practice in centres, is evident.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>At Martinborough Playcentre, the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build the bicultural curriculum and culturally responsive practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For regional staff, priorities are to support members to strengthen their:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>understanding and implementation of new policies and systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding of effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that regional staff actively support and monitor the quality and effectiveness of playcentre practices, in order to be assured that outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau are improved through effective systems, processes and internal evaluation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Martinborough Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Martinborough Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>24 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
