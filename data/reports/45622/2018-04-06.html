</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Surrey Park Early Learning Centre is a not-for-profit community-based education and care service. It has a long history within the community. Murihiku Young Parents Learning Centre is now attached to it. The four centres that used to make up Surrey Park Early Learning Centre Incorporated now operate under one licence.¬†</p><p>A parent committee and director govern and manage the centre. A head teacher (recently appointed) and assistant head teacher support the four team leaders and teachers.</p><p>Surrey Park is licensed for 150 children up to school age, including up to 50 children under two years of age. Children are grouped in to four age-based rooms. Each room is a led by a team leader. Currently the groupings are up to 25 under two year old children, two rooms with two to three and a half year olds and the fourth room with three and a half to school entry.</p><p>The centre's mission statement is to empower lifelong enthusiasm for learning, and provide excellent education and care for children within its community. Centre practices and operations are underpinned by the values of whanaungatanga/relationships, manaakitanga/caring, pono/integrity and whakamana (supporting children to reach their potential).</p><p>Since the last review of the four centres, significant progress has been made in the identified areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in calm and safe environments that reflect a sense of community. They enjoy respectful and positive relations with their teachers. The children show a strong sense of belonging to their centre. They have choices in their activities that are meaningful and relevant to them as learners.</p><p>Children's learning is well supported by:</p><ul>
<li>teachers' purposeful planning that leads to intentional teaching</li>
<li>the close partnerships teachers have with parents and whƒÅnau</li>
<li>the respect teachers have and value they place on children's language, culture and identity</li>
<li>the responsiveness of teaching and curriculum to challenge children</li>
<li>the focus teaching teams have on ensuring children are progressing.</li>
</ul><p>The centre's planning procedures are followed consistently across all rooms. This consistency of practice makes for smoother transitions for parents as their children move through the different rooms.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported in their learning and wellbeing by teachers who are sensitive, responsive and nurturing. Teachers provide an environment where young children have the space to explore and develop their physical skills and confidence. Routines are flexible and infants and toddlers have many opportunities to play and develop positive relationships with their teachers and other children.</p><p>Bicultural practices are increasingly becoming integral to centre operations within the programme and documents. Teachers and leaders are extending their knowledge of MƒÅori concepts and values. This is helping them develop further their bicultural practices.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are well supported. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>comprehensive planning and targeted professional development for teachers</li>
<li>use of external agencies where appropriate</li>
<li>a commitment to make a difference for each child.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders use effective practices of internal evaluation for improvement. Central to the successful change management is the alignment of relevant professional learning and development and teachers appraisal goals. Leaders make their expectations of practice clear and give constructive feedback to teams and individuals. Centre leaders have identified that their current internal evaluation practices need to give them assurance that expectations and improvements are being sustained.</p><p>The governance committee and director have consulted widely to inform the strategic direction of the centre. Further work is being undertaken to ensure a useful planning format.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders need to extend internal evaluation practices to regularly review operations to be assured improvements and expectations are being sustained.</p><p>The committee and leaders need to redevelop how they set out their strategic plan so the format is meaningful and useful, and clearly reflects the centre's priorities for development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Surrey Park Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Surrey Park Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>6 April 2018¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
