<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Lollipops Educare Botany Junction provides high quality care and education for up to 75 children from six months to five years of age. The centre operates from a well resourced facility, serving the Botany Downs community in east Auckland. It is an independently owned franchise within the Lollipops Educare organisation.</p><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review, the centre has been relicensed and now operates as three separate rooms catering for different ages under one merged licence. Effective leadership is a significant factor that contributes to the high quality care and education provided for children in the centre. Good leadership is modelled and valued at all levels.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy warm, positive relationships with adults and each other. Care routines are flexible and unobtrusive. Children are involved in a wide variety of learning experiences. They have ready access to appropriate equipment and resources. This allows them to make independent choices. The different cultural experiences that children and staff bring to the centre are reflected in the programme. There is an awareness of, and support for, children with special needs and abilities. Centre managers and teachers work collaboratively to foster partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau. These partnerships support children&rsquo;s learning and development, both at home and in the centre.</p><p align="left">Teachers are committed to providing a learning programme that is child-initiated. They are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and emergent ideas. Very good planning and assessment practices capture teachers&rsquo; growing emphasis on critically reflecting on their practice. Aspects of early literacy and numeracy concepts are skilfully integrated into learning contexts that are age-appropriate. Teachers work collaboratively to help children develop as capable, competent learners.</p><p align="left">Highly developed systems for robust and regular self review are in place to help the centre make ongoing improvements.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Lollipops Educare Botany Junction was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Lollipops Educare Botany Junction.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Lollipops Educare Botany Junction operates on the second floor of a building situated in a shopping centre. The centre has three separate rooms that cater for different age groups of children. Children have easy access to large outdoor areas.</p><p align="left">The centre philosophy places a high priority on celebrating cultural diversity and working collaboratively with parents and wh&#257;nau. The aim is to create the best learning opportunities for children.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report recommended continuing with professional development focussed on improving the programme in action and ensuring the centre environment supports children&rsquo;s learning. Very good progress has been made in both of these areas.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><em>Teaching practices.</em> Teachers respect children as capable and competent learners. They have a high level of awareness of the importance of engaging children in learning. Teachers listen to what children have to say and respond in genuine ways. They have many conversations with children and encourage them to take the initiative in their learning. Well documented planning and assessment practices support good teaching practice. Planning documents capture teachers&rsquo; growing emphasis on reflecting critically on their practice in order to improve outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><em>Language and early literacy development.</em> Children are well supported to develop language and early literacy skills. Children of all ages are provided with meaningful opportunities to explore and have fun with language. They enjoy reading and writing with teachers, with their peers, and independently. The learning environment is rich in signs, symbols, words, art and photographs that support learning.</p><p align="left"><em>Learning environment.</em> The learning environment is inviting and well resourced. Teachers skilfully create attractive areas of play for children&rsquo;s exploration and discovery. Children are able to select resources independently and use them to support their play. Children of all ages readily access the outdoor areas and engage in challenging activities that allow them to be physically active for extended periods of the day.</p><p align="left"><em>Supporting family/wh&#257;nau partnerships.</em> Centre managers and teachers work collaboratively to foster partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau. These partnerships support children&rsquo;s learning and development, both at home and in the centre. Staff enhance these partnerships through:</p><ul>
<li>well managed programmes to support children and families making transitions into and within the centre and on to school.</li>
<li>awareness of and support for children with special needs and abilities</li>
<li>attractive records of individual learning available for families to contribute to and revisit</li>
<li>open and warm communication and relationships between staff and parents.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><em>Responding to cultural diversity.</em> Children&rsquo;s and teachers&rsquo; languages and cultures are acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers respect and use the first languages of children to promote their sense of belonging and well-being. Programme planning and centre resources reflect the cultural diversity of families.</p><p align="left"><em>Leadership.</em> Effective leadership contributes to the high quality care and education in the centre. Leadership is demonstrated and nurtured at all levels of the centre. Notable examples of good leadership include:</p><ul>
<li>the supportive licensee who has developed a useful and responsive framework of policies and procedures to underpin centre operations</li>
<li>a knowledgeable and professional centre manager who articulates the vision that she is developing with the teaching team and ensures that teachers have a shared understanding about expectations for their professional practice</li>
<li>competent team leaders providing leadership for the education and care of children in their rooms</li>
<li>teachers using their skills and strengths to add richness to centre programmes</li>
<li>children leading their own learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><em>Self review.</em> Centre managers have established highly developed systems for robust and regular self review. They review and monitor the impact of improvements made. Parents are included in the self-review process. Self review is used to support continual improvement in the centre.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left"><em>Sustaining good quality practice.</em> The centre manager has prioritised the need to continue building a critically reflective culture with staff. This should allow good quality practices to be sustained, as well as support further improvements.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Lollipops Educare Botany Junction completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that centre managers should continue to use self-review and critical reflection to support positive outcomes for children.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>23 May 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-lollipops-educare-botany-junction" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Lollipops Educare Botany Junction</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Lollipops Educare Botany Junction.</p><p align="left">Lollipops Educare Botany Junction provides high quality care and education for up to 75 children from six months to five years of age. The centre operates from a well resourced facility, serving the Botany Downs community in east Auckland. It is an independently owned franchise within the Lollipops Educare organisation.</p><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review, the centre has been relicensed and now operates as three separate rooms catering for different ages under one merged licence. Effective leadership is a significant factor that contributes to the high quality care and education provided for children in the centre. Good leadership is modelled and valued at all levels.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy warm, positive relationships with adults and each other. Care routines are flexible and unobtrusive. Children are involved in a wide variety of learning experiences. They have ready access to appropriate equipment and resources. This allows them to make independent choices. The different cultural experiences that children and staff bring to the centre are reflected in the programme. There is an awareness of, and support for, children with special needs and abilities. Centre managers and teachers work collaboratively to foster partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau. These partnerships support children&rsquo;s learning and development, both at home and in the centre.</p><p align="left">Teachers are committed to providing a learning programme that is child-initiated. They are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and emergent ideas. Very good planning and assessment practices capture teachers&rsquo; growing emphasis on critically reflecting on their practice. Aspects of early literacy and numeracy concepts are skilfully integrated into learning contexts that are age-appropriate. Teachers work collaboratively to help children develop as capable, competent learners.</p><p align="left">Highly developed systems for robust and regular self review are in place to help the centre make ongoing improvements.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
