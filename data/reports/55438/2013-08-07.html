</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Martinborough Kindergarten is located in the township of Martinborough on the grounds of the local primary school.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 30 children over two years of age and operates five days a week. Eleven children are Māori.</p><p>Since the April 2010 ERO report, there have been developments to the kindergarten. These include renovations to connect the indoor and outdoor spaces, and the increase in the provision of information and communication technologies (ICT) equipment. These developments are still in progress. The kindergarten is a healthy heart award recipient.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy is symbolised in the design of five koru, which represent the importance of culture, relationships, information technology, the environment and children’s independence.</p><p>All teachers are qualified. The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association) effectively governs the kindergarten, and provides senior teacher support for the kindergarten. They are committed to maintaining the ratio of 100% of teachers qualified. Well-developed policy guidelines clearly outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day to-day operations.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience relationships that are affirming, and responsive. Teachers know children well and foster their sense of belonging. Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed. Support for children with additional needs is very inclusive.</p><p>Children have opportunities to take on leadership roles in the kindergarten. ERO observed older or more experienced children helping others. Many children are involved in play for extended periods, making choices and following their interests. Teachers encourage their independence and self help skills. Children and teachers enjoy each other’s company.</p><p>Teachers are skilled at supporting children to settle in. Transition to the kindergarten is flexible and responsive to the needs and preferences of children and families. Positive, reciprocal relationships with the school help to support children and families with the move to school.</p><p>There are many ways for children to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices in the well-resourced environment. They actively contribute in caring for their environment. Other features include the focus on literacy and numeracy resources, children’s participation in imaginative and creative play, and the use of ICT as a learning tool.</p><p>Teachers work well together, share ideas and support each other. They value each other’s strengths.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well-targeted, ongoing support and guidance for teachers. They promote regular professional development opportunities, and useful systems that are focused on positive outcomes for children. A planned development of the performance appraisal processes has the potential to better promote teacher practices.</p><p>The environment reflects the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand in many ways. Children have some opportunities to hear te reo Māori in the programme. Teachers, with the association support, are beginning to make good use of self review to build on and extend their practice in giving significance to Māori learners’ culture, language, and identity. ERO affirms this development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning. The next steps to continue strengthening are:</p><ul>
<li>to embed understanding and use of self review to critically inquire into their teaching practices</li>
<li>to further develop assessment, planning and evaluation processes to more clearly show how children and parents contribute to assessment information, and how this is used to plan for individuals and groups of children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Martinborough Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Martinborough Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>7 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
