</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kopuwai Early Learning Centre is a small community-based service in Central Otago. The centre is positioned close to local schools and has strong links with the wider community. It provides education and care for 31 children in a mixed-age setting. A competent parent-led committee works closely with a senior teacher and her team. All the teachers have a teaching qualification and have a shared approach to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Since the ERO visit in 2013, there have been improvements to the building, and planning is underway to redevelop the outdoor area. Leaders and teachers have made very good progress in addressing the recommendations in ERO's 2013 report. Self review/internal evaluation processes have supported the centre to further develop a number of aspects of the centre's operations. Teachers are making good progress building the bicultural content of centre programmes and there have been useful changes made to improve the curriculum and build consistency in teaching practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The clear centre vision and philosophy guide the centre. Caring, trusting relationships between teachers, children, whƒÅnau and the community are of key importance. Teachers have created a calm, settled, home-like environment inclusive of all and a place where everyone learns together. Parents are comfortable to stay and play with their own and other children.</p><p>Children are viewed as capable, competent learners. They:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>confidently make their needs and wants known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>play very well with and alongside each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are encouraged to be independent.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The older children show care, support and respect for younger ones. These practices make the concepts of manaakitanga, ako and tuakana-teina very evident. Centre events and celebrations also help strengthen the ties between the children, the team, families and the community.</p><p>Teachers use effective strategies to ensure smooth routines and transitions between parts of the day. Very young children are settled and show a strong sense of belonging within the centre whƒÅnau. Teachers are highly responsive to their nonverbal cues and gently foster children‚Äôs oral language development. Teachers know when to stand back and allow children to freely explore and problem solve.</p><p>Teachers engage in conversations with the older children that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>are affirming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make links to their lives at home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend their learning and thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The programme provided for children is based on the principles and strands of Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum, and is responsive to children‚Äôs strengths and interests. Children of all ages have access to a wide range of interesting activities and experiences. They show purpose in their play. They use the resources and equipment creatively to investigate things of interest to them, with the teachers offering support and guidance where needed. They learn concepts of early literacy and mathematics in meaningful ways through their play.</p><p>There are effective systems for planning, assessment and evaluation. The teachers have a clear understanding of the centre's main learning priorities and these are evident in practice. There is the potential to use these priorities for learning more meaningfully in group planning. They need to assess children‚Äôs progress against these and evaluate the teaching strategies used to support these.</p><p>The senior teacher, committee and teachers work collaboratively with a common purpose, focused on benefiting children. The senior teacher has high expectations for the service. She is an effective leader and manages the service well. She has established useful systems that support a culture of ongoing improvement. She uses the strengths and skills of the team well. She has also established networks in the community to access mutual support and mentoring, and to encourage collaborative sharing. Adults share centre responsibilities and support, and encourage one another to develop leadership capabilities.</p><p>The senior teacher uses a range of systems and practices to effectively monitor the quality of aspects of the service and to identify gaps and next steps for improvement. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a useful self review/evaluation process focused on improving the quality of learning and teaching and how the environment supports this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an effective appraisal system that builds teacher capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a useful strategic plan, developed collaboratively to guide the centre‚Äôs direction towards its vision.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the senior teacher discussed other ways centre systems could be refined to support the service further. The committee, senior teacher and teachers should find ways to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine the self review/internal evaluation system by making better use of indicators at all stages of the review and simplifying documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more clearly record how they monitor the strategic plan and show in the annual action plan the rigour of the actions already underway.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kopuwai Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>¬†</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kopuwai Early Learning Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>18 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
