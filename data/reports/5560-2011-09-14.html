<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Botanical Road Free Kindergarten is situated in Tauranga and operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association. It operates five mornings and two afternoons a week and is licensed to provide sessional education and care for children from two years old to school age.</p><p align="left">There have been significant staff changes over the past year. The development of a new teaching team is providing an opportunity to review current kindergarten teaching, learning and administration practices. Teachers are committed to the Enviroschools initiative and to developing a culture of respect.</p><p align="left">The newly appointed head teacher is a highly experienced leader with a sound knowledge of early childhood practices and programmes. She provides an effective model of teaching and management, and is successfully creating a team culture where teachers work collaboratively in the interests of children. Current appraisal processes are based on teacher self-reflection. A more focused approach, including documented observation of teaching, focused development goals, and ongoing feedback to individual teachers, is likely to further enhance the quality of education.</p><p align="left">The programme is well developed and interesting. A suitable variety of open-ended activities promotes creativity and self expression. Mathematics and literacy are suitably integrated. Children are increasingly able to make decisions, pursue interests and direct their own learning. Teachers are now focusing on developing a shared understanding of assessment practices and increasing teacher confidence in integrating te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into the daily programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers are responsive, respectful and caring. Expectations for children&rsquo;s behaviour are well established, and positive guidance is used effectively to foster social competence and self management. The consistently calm and inclusive tone promotes children&rsquo;s well-being and the way they quickly settle into routines. Teacher&rsquo;s interventions are carefully timed to support developing ideas and extend thinking. Children demonstrate high levels of engagement in sustained play and learning.</p><p align="left">Parents spoken to during this Education Review expressed confidence that their children&rsquo;s diverse needs were being catered for. They feel well informed through regular newsletters and informal conversations with staff.</p><p align="left">An appropriate range of regularly reviewed policies and practices contribute to an emotionally and physically safe environment for children and employees.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Botanical Road Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBotanical Road Free Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">There have been significant staff changes over the past year including the recent employment of a new head teacher. The development of a new teaching team is providing the opportunity to review current kindergarten teaching, learning and administration practices. The kindergarten has a commitment to Enviroschools and to developing a culture of respect. The outdoor area is being redeveloped to reflect a more natural environment and the bathroom area has been renovated.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Learning environment:</b> Children benefit from a high quality, stimulating environment that provides a wide range of resources and learning experiences. The environment is well organised and planned to support children to revisit their current learning interests and extend their ideas. Purposeful play spaces encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration. Attractive wall displays inform parents and others of children&rsquo;s learning interests and special events in the kindergarten and community. The spacious outdoor area provides many physical challenges and opportunities to learn about sustainability and the natural world. Literacy and numeracy are strongly integrated into the learning environment.</p><p align="left"><b>Programme:</b> The programme is well developed and interesting. Children are able to make decisions about their level of participation. Mathematics and literacy are well integrated into the programme in appropriate contexts. A suitable variety of open-ended activities promotes creativity and self expression. Transition into and through the kindergarten is carefully considered to meet the needs of individuals. Teachers continue to review and develop their approach to programme planning. They regularly take note of, and discuss, individuals and strategies that they might try to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left"><b>Interactions:</b> Teachers are responsive, respectful and caring. They know children well and provide appropriate support to help them settle into the routines of the day. Expectations for behaviour are well established and positive guidance encourages children&rsquo;s self management. Teachers carefully observe children at play. Teaching interventions are well timed to support developing ideas and extending thinking. As a result, children demonstrate high levels of engagement in their play.</p><p align="left"><b>Self review:</b> Effective self review is contributing to ongoing improvement to the quality of education and responsiveness to centre stakeholders. Self review is well understood and leads to evidence-based decision making. Processes are both formal and informal, and ongoing reflection highlights successes and identifies future challenges.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The newly established team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for the kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>developing a shared understanding of assessment practices; and</li>
<li>increasing teacher confidence in integrating te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into the daily programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><b>Appraisal process</b>: Due to staff changes the annual appraisal process for 2010 was not completed. A new appraisal process has recently been introduced. While the current appraisal process is based on teacher self reflection, more focused feedback to individuals is now needed. Specific goals, relating to teaching practice and ongoing observations to monitor progress towards these goals, are likely to improve the quality of teaching and education provided.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">Botanical Road Free Kindergarten is inclusive of all children and welcomes children with special needs. A close association with outside agencies enhances the ability for teachers to provide the extra support children require.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left"><b>Individual programmes:</b> Individual programmes are developed with families/wh&#257;nau and professionals in a collaborative way. Families are consulted when setting goals or making decisions about children with special needs. These programmes are closely linked to Te Wh&#257;riki, and open communication with parents is ongoing. There is a team approach to implementing individual programmes.</p><p align="left"><b>Inclusion:</b> Teachers review and develop strategies that are appropriate for children with special needs. They encourage all children to be accepting of others and to help those needing support. Teachers see the potential in every child and celebrate their achievements. Children with special needs are involved in all kindergarten activities, including daily programmes and special events.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Botanical Road Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.

</table><p>14 September 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-botanical-road-free-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Botanical Road Free Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Botanical Road Free Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Botanical Road Free Kindergarten is situated in Tauranga and operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association. It operates five mornings and two afternoons a week and is licensed to provide sessional education and care for children from two years old to school age.</p><p align="left">There have been significant staff changes over the past year. The development of a new teaching team is providing an opportunity to review current kindergarten teaching, learning and administration practices. Teachers are committed to the Enviroschools initiative and to developing a culture of respect.</p><p align="left">The newly appointed head teacher is a highly experienced leader with a sound knowledge of early childhood practices and programmes. She provides an effective model of teaching and management, and is successfully creating a team culture where teachers work collaboratively in the interests of children. Current appraisal processes are based on teacher self-reflection. A more focused approach, including documented observation of teaching, focused development goals, and ongoing feedback to individual teachers, is likely to further enhance the quality of education.</p><p align="left">The programme is well developed and interesting. A suitable variety of open-ended activities promotes creativity and self expression. Mathematics and literacy are suitably integrated. Children are increasingly able to make decisions, pursue interests and direct their own learning. Teachers are now focusing on developing a shared understanding of assessment practices and increasing teacher confidence in integrating te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into the daily programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers are responsive, respectful and caring. Expectations for children&rsquo;s behaviour are well established, and positive guidance is used effectively to foster social competence and self management. The consistently calm and inclusive tone promotes children&rsquo;s well-being and the way they quickly settle into routines. Teacher&rsquo;s interventions are carefully timed to support developing ideas and extend thinking. Children demonstrate high levels of engagement in sustained play and learning.</p><p align="left">Parents spoken to during this Education Review expressed confidence that their children&rsquo;s diverse needs were being catered for. They feel well informed through regular newsletters and informal conversations with staff.</p><p align="left">An appropriate range of regularly reviewed policies and practices contribute to an emotionally and physically safe environment for children and employees.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
