</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Drummond Rural Kindergarten is located in Drummond, Southland. It is licensed for 33 children aged from two years to school age. The kindergarten is open for five hours each week day. Many children attend the kindergarten part time due to the long distances their families travel from outlying areas. Children come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, including seven MƒÅori children at the time of the review.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by Kindergartens South (KS) and receives regular support from KS senior teachers. There are four teachers at the kindergarten, including two head teachers sharing the leadership role. After the 2013 ERO review senior teachers supported the teachers to develop action plans to address the key next steps. The team has made good progress in most of the identified areas, particularly in improving assessment practices for individual children. Effective internal evaluation continues to be an area for further improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of fourteen kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kindergartens South).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Drummond Kindergarten is a focal point in the community, where parents, whƒÅnau and children are supported to make connections with one another and have a sense of belonging. This and effective leadership within the kindergarten are helping to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from a broad and localised programme. They have many opportunities to learn about early literacy, mathematics, and science in authentic contexts such as gardening and environmental activities. Teachers deliberately foster children's dispositions of creativity, curiosity, working with others and giving things a go.</p><p>Children are well supported in their learning. Children for whom English is a second language are well supported by the way teachers use deliberate strategies to help them to learn English. Teachers carefully plan to help children make smooth transitions to school.</p><p>All children are able to develop an understanding and appreciation of New Zealand‚Äôs bi-cultural heritage through hearing te reo MƒÅori, waiata and learning about aspects of te ao MƒÅori. To better show how MƒÅori children are succeeding as MƒÅori, teachers need to find ways to make MƒÅori children's language, culture and identity more visible in records of learning.</p><p>Teachers are fostering genuine partnerships for learning with parents and whƒÅnau. This is evident in the way teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>value children's diverse backgrounds and enable parents to share their cultures and skills in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek and respond to parents' wishes for their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use what they learn from parents about their children's interests and strengths to enhance children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly share specific information with parents about the learning that is happening in the kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have developed effective systems for planning for individual children. Group planning clearly identifies intended learning and links to the centre philosophy. Teachers provide a wide range of interesting experiences relevant to the intended learning. Documentation needs to more clearly show the planning for these experiences and the associated strategies teachers will use to support learning. Individual records could better show how teachers respond to children's diverse languages, cultures and identities.</p><p>There are useful systems for the smooth running of the kindergarten. Leaders and teachers have clear ideas about what they believe and what they want children to learn. The current philosophy contains many of these ideas, but needs to be strengthened by making their desired outcomes for children's learning more explicit. Teachers need to document the kindergarten's vision to guide long-term direction for the kindergarten. It is important for teachers, when reviewing the philosophy and developing the vision, to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure these reflect their commitment to the bicultural heritage of New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work collaboratively with parents to ensure their aspirations and values are included.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are committed to making ongoing improvements and are developing their understanding of effective internal evaluation. They need to continue to build their understanding and use of effective internal evaluation to monitor and improve programmes and practices.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from ongoing and well-planned professional learning and development. A new appraisal system is being introduced, further development is required to include expectations for observations and explicit links to TƒÅtaiako. Specific goals to support leadership should be included within the process.</p><p>The kindergarten receives good support from Kindergartens South (KS). The KS board has a clear strategic vision that outlines key priorities for development. The next step is to ensure explicit alignment of these priorities to each kindergartens‚Äô long term planning. The board has identified that internal evaluation practice is not strong at board level. The board needs to receive evaluative reporting of how well these plans and other initiatives have been enacted and the impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps to promote positive outcomes for all children are for the head teacher and teachers with the support of the KS senior teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the vision and review the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that documentation shows how teachers value and respond to children's diverse language, culture and identity, including MƒÅori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make visible in group planning the planned experiences and the strategies to support the intended learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen and use effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The key next steps for the KS board are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the appraisal system continues to be developed and embedded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and use rigorous internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure explicit alignment of kindergarten planning to implement the KS strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive evaluative reporting of progress towards the strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Drummond Rural Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Drummond Rural Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>9 August 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
