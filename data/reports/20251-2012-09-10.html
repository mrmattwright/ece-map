<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Pupuke Early Education Centre Pukekos is reasonably well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre operates under well developed management and operational systems, policies and procedures.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Pupuke Early Education Centre Pukekos in Takapuna is one of two centres on one site under the ownership and management of a larger service provider closer to the city. The Pukeko room caters for children between three and a half years old and school age. This is the first ERO review for this centre which opened in 2009. Children are drawn from a wide geographical area.</p>
<p>Team building and professional development have had a positive impact on the centre. Teachers have established collaborative relationships that facilitate smooth transitions for children between the two centres.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy clearly outlines the intentions of the service to provide a home-away-from-home for children. It includes information about the Virtues Programme that teachers promote with children. This programme outlines a commitment to ensure that children are well prepared for future education.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Teachers and children enjoy friendly and trusting relationships. Children are relaxed and settled. They play happily together, helping each other and discussing their games. Teachers are caring and generally lead the programme in cheerful and inclusive ways. They know children and their families well. Their knowledge of children&rsquo;s cultures and families contributes to children&rsquo;s feelings of inclusion and belonging. Teachers use words in children&rsquo;s home languages to help settle them.</p>
<p>Teachers continue to build their understanding and knowledge about their work through professional development that is identified as part of appraisal. Teachers are attending an extended programme to build their capacity to use te reo M&#257;ori and to strengthen tikanga M&#257;ori practices in the centre. The environment clearly demonstrates teachers&rsquo; good intentions to make New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage well understood by children.</p>
<p>Parents/wh&#257;nau are well informed about the programme and children&rsquo;s learning through frequent written communication and conversations. The programme is based on what teachers perceive children are interested in and on their own ideas and interests. Teachers share planning that is appropriately based on well established assessment practices. Evaluation of the programme is regular.</p>
<p>The centre environment is attractive, print-rich and well supplied with quality resources. Displays affirm children&rsquo;s participation in programmes. Regular and detailed health and safety checks ensure that the environment is as safe as possible for children.</p>
<p>During the review centre managers and ERO agreed about the next steps for further improving the programme provided for children. They discussed the advantages of:</p>
<ul>
<li>making the programme more child-initiated</li>
<li>providing more opportunities for prolonged reciprocal conversations between teachers and children based on children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>making the programme more challenging by encouraging children&rsquo;s problem-solving and thinking skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Centre managers also agreed there would be value in:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening and extending the depth of self-review practices</li>
<li>strengthening consensus decision-making as part of centre&rsquo;s collaborative approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s findings also indicate that some centre practices are not fully reflective of the principles underlying <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood education curriculum. These practices focus on school-type activities, skills and knowledge. The use of these more structured activities reduces the opportunities children have to learn in meaningful contexts as part of play.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pupuke Early Education Centre Pukekos completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
