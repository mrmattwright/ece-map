</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tinytown Pakuranga 3 Learning Centre is a new service and is one of three centres on two sites. It is part of the Tinytown organisation, which also operates early childhood centres in Otahuhu and Mt Wellington. Centre 3 has an emphasis on preparing children for school. The centre has three registered teachers and has had a strong focus on developing relationships with parents.</p><p>Long serving owners provide family focused education and care for children. A Christian ethos is an important part of their philosophy and centre operations. Centre 3 provides for up to 30 children over three years of age and the adjacent centre provides for younger children. Teachers and children have access to a large carpeted hall which is used frequently for events and indoor sports activities in inclement weather. The centre serves a multicultural community with diverse languages, cultures and needs.</p><p>Tinytown has employed a new complex manager to oversee centre operations and provide professional support to all three of the Pakurangacentres. The programme reflects <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Since the centre opened in March 2013, teachers have engaged in professional development and have improved documentation with an increased focus on child-initiated play. Children now have improved access to materials and resources that support their interests and play.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, capable and caring learners. They actively engage in play and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. They have fun and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They explore, make discoveries and have good opportunities to make choices about their play. Learning dispositions such as persistence are encouraged. Teachers' planning supports children's interest in the natural world.</p><p>Respectful and responsive relationships underpin the centre’s welcoming and inclusive tone. Centre leaders and staff encourage family and community involvement. There is a relaxed atmosphere and teachers are attentive and accepting of family beliefs andchildren’s ideas, cultural needs and preferences.</p><p>Parents receive good information about their children's day and are able to take an active part in the centre programme and events. They have regular opportunities for communication, consultation and information sharing with teachers about their children. Some parents have more than one child at the centre, and some children attending are now second generations. Teachers are reflecting on ways to develop parent partnership in learning with their child.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children and support their play. They know children well, listen carefully and encourage children to talk with each other. Teachers encourage children to use and maintain their first languages and increase their competency in theEnglish language. Support for children with diverse languages is a feature of the service.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em> and the teaching philosophy of the centre. Teacher interactions with children are positive and supportive. Teachers provide good opportunities for children to develop their physical skills and foster their creativity and imagination<em>.</em> The environment is print rich, well resourced and carefully organised. Early science, literacy and mathematics concepts are also encouraged though play and planned activities.</p><p>Centre leaders have a strong commitment to providing a good quality service, including developing a culture of teacher reflection. They are aware that self review is an area for development. Centre operations are guided by sound management practices, and a comprehensive framework of polices.</p><p>Teachers’ professional capabilities and leadership are fostered through mentoring and ongoing professional development. Recent professional development is assisting teachers to use self review as a tool to guide ongoing improvement<em>.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining assessment, planning and evaluation processes to more clearly show how teachers notice, respond to and build on children’s individual interests over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how well bicultural practices are enacted and promote Māori language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing strategies that maximise learning in the outside environment including literacy and mathematics in play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening self review to be more evaluative and evidence based</p>
</li>
<li>building on existing long and short term management planning to more clearly align with the centre vision and philosophy.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tinytown Pakuranga 3 Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices the service could develop a more consistent and robust appraisal process aligned with the Practicing Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tinytown Pakuranga 3 Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 December 2016</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
