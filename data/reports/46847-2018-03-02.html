</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puawai - Homebased Childcare is licensed to provide an early childhood education and care service for up to 80 children from infancy to school age. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. Most educators are grandparents or other family members. Approximately 85 percent of the children enrolled have Pacific heritage. Another five percent are of Indian descent.</p><p>The service has two visiting teachers who are registered early childhood teachers. They regularly visit educators in the home to support them to plan education programmes for children. The service's philosophy promotes children learning through play whilst being immersed in their own cultural environment, surrounded by their familiar customs, first language, and religion.</p><p>The owner is responsible for the overall governance of the service and is supported by an office administrator. They work collaboratively with coordinators, educators and families to set the strategic direction for the service.</p><p>This is the first review of the service which was established in December 2015.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy is very evident in practice. Children maintain strong connections with their first language and cultural heritage. This provides a bridge for their new learning. Very close partnerships between children, educators and families support children's strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Educators design programmes that value children's interests and dispositions for learning. Learning records show that children are well supported to develop their creativity, early literacy and mathematics knowledge. Children with additional learning needs are well supported to access the full curriculum. The introduction of theme-based planning is intended to expand the curriculum and children's learning experiences in particular. This approach supports educators to provide a wider variety of learning activities. This development is in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>Visiting teachers provide good support for educators to recognise children's learning and plan next steps to extend them and their play. They have regular discussions with educators and their support is individualised to meet the different needs of the educator and the children they care for. This effective guidance and feedback to educators is well documented. Visiting teachers regularly provide well organised workshops to help educators develop their teaching practice. The visiting teachers themselves also access and respond well to regular professional learning and development to grow their own practice.</p><p>There is an organisational culture of trust and respect. The owner takes an active role in the service and fosters a team approach. The managers and visiting teachers work in collaborative and transparent ways to share information and develop learning partnerships with educators, families and the community. Visiting teachers and educators ensure that interactions with parents and families are culturally responsive.</p><p>Very good management systems are in place to support the education and care of children. Policies and procedures are well developed and regularly reviewed. Health and safety systems are robust and provide assurance that expectations are being well monitored.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used well to support ongoing improvement. A useful review framework guides evaluative thinking across the network. Internal evaluation is systematic, well documented and covers all areas of the service's operation. Feedback is sought from educators and parents as part of the internal evaluation process, giving a shared ownership of service decision making and strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service and ERO worked together to identify key next steps to enhance existing practices. These include:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>increasing the extent to which programmes reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
<li>establishing a resource library to support educators</li>
<li>ensuring the service's theme based learning plans show how children will access at any one time, all strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>documenting how programme plans cater for children under two years of age.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puawai - Homebased Childcare completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p></p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices the service should:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>strengthen its risk management planning for excursions taken by the educator</li>
<li>have a written supervision plan in place for each home detailing adequate supervision for children at all times</li>
<li>implement annual appraisal for visiting teachers that meets Education Council requirements for the renewal of their practising teacher certificates.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puawai - Homebased Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>2 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
