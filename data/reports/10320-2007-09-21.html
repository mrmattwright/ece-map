<a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Les Mills Kids Club New Lynn is set up in a large gymnasium space daily to provide education and care sessions for a maximum of two hours for children of members attending classes.¬† Centre operation is underpinned by well-established systems and policies that are generic to Les Mills Kids Clubs.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers are skilled at quickly establishing warm and nurturing relationships with children and making parents feel welcome.¬† They work hard to engage children in meaningful play and to foster the development of social, language and physical skills.¬† They also provide appropriate support for literacy and the development of simple scientific and mathematical concepts.¬† Children have a strong sense of belonging and confidently select from a wide variety of well-presented play areas and equipment.¬† They play well independently, alongside or with others and often engage in simple social and cooperative play.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">A separate under-two area allows babies and toddlers to practise their developing physical skills without interference from older children.¬† This area is well resourced and includes collections of everyday items that provide babies and toddlers with good opportunities for sensory exploration.¬† The manager is particularly skilled in interacting with and settling babies and toddlers and provides excellent support for less experienced staff in this area.¬† A stronger focus on staff talking to babies and toddlers would further support their language development.<b></b></p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers keep parents well informed about their children through informal discussion and sharing of photographs.<b>¬† </b>The teaching team is keen to develop simple systems to help further extend children‚Äôs emerging interests<b> </b>and learning and to document the progress for children who attend more regularly.¬† The team could consider professional support on Kei Tua o Te Pae Assessment for Learning: Early Childhood Exemplars to develop appropriate systems.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The centre continues to be well managed.¬† The licensee, manager and staff regularly review centre documentation and objectives for improvement.¬† Parent surveys inform decision making and indicate a high level of satisfaction with the service provided.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">This report evaluates the quality of education, including assessment, the quality of self review and the centre‚Äôs health and safety practices.¬† It identifies many areas of good performance and makes some<b> </b>suggestions for improvement.¬† ERO agrees with the licensee and manager that they should amend the centre‚Äôs annual and long-term plans to address the areas for improvement and a small number of administrative and health and safety issues identified in this report.</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.¬† Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<a id="3-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of Les Mills Kids Club New Lynn was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.¬† ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.¬† This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLes Mills Kids Club New Lynn.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.¬† For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Documentation received prior to the review visit stated that the centre had yet to create a self review process.¬† Accordingly ERO decided to evaluate</p>
<ul>
<li>the quality of self review.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The centre continues to provide sessions of up to two hours for children of gym patrons.¬† As the gym uses the play space for instruction in the afternoon, the early childhood equipment and barriers are set up daily and packed away at the end of each session.¬† The barriers are used to separate areas for children the under and over two years old.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The teaching team‚Äôs level of early childhood qualifications and experience varies considerably. ¬†The team consists of one provisionally registered teacher, three qualified early childhood teachers, two staff in training and two untrained staff.</p>
<h4 class="ReportText1stPara">Areas of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Emotional wellbeing.¬† Staff welcome children warmly and quickly establish relationships with new children.¬† Their interactions with children are consistently positive and child management strategies are low key and effective. ¬†Teachers can readily access parents if their children are distressed or unwell.¬† This, and the short duration of sessions contribute to children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing.¬† As a result, children are very settled and confidently attempt activities and play independently.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Welcoming parents.¬† Teachers interact enthusiastically with parents and make them feel welcome.¬† Staff and parents engage in natural conversations about what the child has done and how they are feeling.¬† Parents also demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.¬† They breast feed their children, use the nappy change area and enjoy time with their children in the centre.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Language.¬† Teaching staff who provide the most effective support for language development constantly talk to children, matching words to children‚Äôs actions and experiences.¬† They frequently engage in extended conversations with children.¬† Morning tea times are pleasant social occasions for children and adults.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">Social interaction.¬† Staff provide good support for the development of social skills, such as turn taking.¬† Children play well with or alongside other children.¬† They engage in simple social and cooperative play.¬† Relationships are evident between siblings and children who attend on a regular basis.¬† Children can elect to join group activities, and toddlers are sometimes given the option of spending time in the over-two area.¬† This is important as children are at different stages of developing a sense of belonging.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Support.¬† Teaching staff work hard to engage children in meaningful play.¬† Those in the under-two area encourage children to explore with play equipment.¬† Their counterparts in the over-two area facilitate play by asking children what equipment they need, making suggestions and modelling the use of equipment.¬† They also encourage children to identify what they would like to do next.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">Leadership.¬† The manager leads the teaching team skilfully.¬† She moves staff between the under and over-two areas to maintain required staff to child ratios.¬† This ensures that there are sufficient staff to meet children‚Äôs needs.¬† Teachers work well as a team to monitor changes in children‚Äôs location and interest so that they can support children‚Äôs play effectively.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Literacy, science and mathematics.¬† Teachers foster early literacy, scientific and mathematical learning.¬† They actively support children‚Äôs exploration of items in the interactive science area.¬† Teachers also encourage counting and the incorporation of mathematical concepts and positional language in the context of play.¬† They read and retell stories for the children and encourage them write their names and to identify the letters that their names begin with.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Physical skills.¬† Children have good opportunities to practise physical skills, such as climbing, balancing and using ride-on toys.¬† Occasionally they participate in exercise sessions lead by gym instructors.¬† Babies and toddlers are able to lie on the floor, crawl and practise standing and walking without interference from older children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Learning environment.¬† Both the under-two and over-two areas are spacious, colourful and well resourced.¬† Areas of play for older children are well defined and include effective areas for family and block/train play.¬† Equipment for ‚Äòstep‚Äô exercises is used creatively to provide physical challenges for older children.¬† Teachers also stimulate babies‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô sensory exploration by providing collections of everyday items for them to investigate.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for improvement</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Further supporting literacy learning.¬† Teachers could further encourage children to experiment with writing by setting up an attractive and well-resourced writing area and a sign in table for children daily.¬† It would also be good practice to annotate photographs of children‚Äôs learning and art with children‚Äôs explanations.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Extending older children.¬† Teachers sometimes solve problems for children or unintentionally change the focus of play.¬† They could consider taking additional time to observe children‚Äôs play before intervening.¬† This would enable teachers to more accurately identify the focus of play and find more relevant ways to extend children‚Äôs interests.¬† Waiting longer should also give the children opportunities to solve problems independently.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">Interactions with babies and toddlers.¬† The quality of staff interactions with babies and toddlers varies with staff expertise and experience.¬† The manager consistently models high quality interactions.¬† Further support for less experienced staff to talk to children about their actions and experiences would be appropriate.¬† This would provide more consistent support for infants‚Äô language development and would further stimulate their exploration of the learning environment.</p>
<p class="ReportText">M√§ori language and culture.¬† Teachers include some M√§ori language during mat-times, and the display board acknowledges some aspects of M√§ori culture.¬† The teaching team has appropriately identified the need to increase the use of M√§ori language in the learning programme.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">Creativity.¬† Some art activities, such as using stencils, involve little creativity.¬† If children are to become capable and competent artists it is important that they own each step of the creative process.</p>
<h3>Self Review</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO decided to evaluate the quality of self review because documentation received prior to the review visit stated that the centre had yet to create a self-review process.¬† This contrasted with the finding in the June 2004 ERO report that the licensee had established effective cycles for self review for all aspects of the centre‚Äôs operations.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Review of documentation and objectives.¬† The licensee and staff regularly review centre documentation and their objectives for improvement.¬† They have recently reviewed the centre‚Äôs policies, philosophy statement and plan for implementing charter requirements in consultation with parents.¬† Surveys of parents and staff inform centre decision making.¬† Procedures for transition between the over and under-two areas have also been reviewed.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for improvement</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Records of self review.¬† The licensee could further enhance review processes by keeping records of the changes made and the reasons for them.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">Staff appraisal.¬† The licensee and manager are aware of the need to update and implement the centre‚Äôs staff appraisal policy and procedures.¬† Implementation has lapsed while key personnel have been on maternity leave.</p>
<a id="4-areas-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Areas of National Interest</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports.¬† This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Assessment in Early Childhood Services</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is currently evaluating the quality of assessment practice in early childhood services.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">In good quality early childhood centres, educators and parents use assessment information to support children in their learning.¬† They notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs strengths and interests.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The Ministry of Education is currently funding professional development over a five-year period starting from 2005.¬† Early childhood services are at varying stages in their understanding and implementation of effective assessment practice.¬† In this centre one teacher who has recently completed training is familiar with Kei Tua O Te Pae Assessment For Learning: Early Childhood Exemplars.¬† Staff have had no other professional development specifically on assessment.</p>
<p class="ReportText">In early 2007 half of the centre‚Äôs fully trained staff were on leave.¬† This had a negative impact on the maintenance of assessment practices, including children‚Äôs scrapbooks.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Five percent of children attending are the children of staff members.¬† The frequency of children attending varies from once a month to 2 or 3 times each week, and usually they only attend for a period of two to three months.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Informal planning.¬† From day to day teachers have no way of knowing in advance which children will be attending.¬† As children arrive teachers discuss how to resource the environment.¬† They know the children who attend more regularly well and they provide activities that are relevant to the interests of these children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Evaluation.¬† Teachers focus monthly programme evaluations on children‚Äôs learning and improving teacher practice.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Parental involvement.¬† Staff keep parents well informed about their children through informal conversations and by sharing annotated photographs of their time at Kids Club.¬† Parents provide profile information about their child on enrolment.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for improvement</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Further improving the quality of planning.¬† The teaching team has identified the need to improve the quality of programme planning.¬† Teachers informally discuss children at the end of each session.¬† It would be good practice for them to record the interests of children that emerged and possibilities to extend these should the children return.¬† To provide continuity teachers could also develop written strategies for supporting learning, for example in science, language, literacy and mathematics, and identify their expectations of children of different ages.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Individual planning.¬† Teachers have ceased to plan for individual children.¬† They should now consider using learning narratives to identify possibilities for extending the learning and interests of children who attend at least two days a week.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Assessment.¬† The teaching team has identified the need to reintroduce portfolios for children who attend more regularly.¬† For children who attend less than two days a week, it would be appropriate to give the parents annotated photographs of their child‚Äôs day.¬† Teachers could consider simplifying the format that they use for recording learning stories.¬† This would make the portfolios more inviting for children and parents and easier to read.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">Increasing parental input.¬† Teachers could record relevant comments that parents make about their children in their portfolios.¬† Asking specific questions about a child‚Äôs interests is an effective way to encourage a parent to share information about their child.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Recommendation</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO recommends that the licensee seek whole centre professional support for the teaching team on Kei Tua o Te Pae to improve the quality of assessment practices.</p>
<a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the licensee and staff of Les Mills Kids Club New Lynn completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.¬† In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">The centre is licensed for children to attend for a maximum of two hours a day.¬† However, the children of teaching staff attend for two and a half hours.¬† The licensee should consult the Ministry of Education about this practice.¬†</p>
<p class="ReportText">In order to improve current practice, teaching staff should:</p>
<ul>
<li>remind parents that they may only sign out at the end of the session;</li>
<li>not allow parents to leave their children until they have completed an enrolment form;</li>
<li>remove small items of equipment that could choke infants before letting them visit the over-two area;</li>
<li>more closely monitor toddlers‚Äô use of ride-on toys on steps; and</li>
<li>regularly practise earthquake drills.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Management should:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve children‚Äôs access to paper towels;</li>
<li>at least once a year, test the effectiveness of the fire drill arrangement for evacuating children under-two at the same time that the entire building is evacuated; and</li>
<li>ensure that at all times that children attend a registered early childhood teacher is working with the children.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">The licensee is aware of the need to encourage fully qualified staff to seek provisional registration to enable the centre is to meet teacher registration requirements.¬† From the end of 2007, the centre should have three registered early childhood teachers working concurrently with the children.¬† Despite ongoing recruitment efforts, the licensee acknowledges that it will be difficult for the centre to meet this requirement.</p>
<p class="ReportText">During the course of the review ERO identified two areas of non-compliance.¬† In order to address this the licensee and manager must:</p>
<p class="ActionReq" style="padding-left: 30px;">5.1 ¬†implement staff appraisal,<br>[Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 11a]; and</p>
<p class="ActionReq" style="padding-left: 30px;">5.2 ¬†meet requirements for displaying notices beside the licence,<br>[Education (ECC) Regulations 1998, 9(c)(i)(ii)].</p>
<a id="6-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Recommendation</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO agrees with the licensee and centre manager that they should amend the centre‚Äôs annual and long term plans to address the areas for improvement and the health and safety matters identified in this report.</p>
<a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.¬† Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
