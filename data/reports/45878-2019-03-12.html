</table><p>Te Mata Kids¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Mata Kids is an all-day early learning service located in Havelock North. Until May 2018 it operated as Little Guppies Private Kindergarten &amp; Childcare. In May 2018 Provincial Education Group Ltd (PEG) purchased the service and rebranded it.</p><p>Since PEG have operated the service considerable changes have occurred. Including the organisational structure, philosophy, environment and centre leadership. A newly appointed centre manager started at the beginning of 2019.</p><p>The service is licensed for 70 children including 25 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO evaluation there are 66 enrolled, including 14 MƒÅori children.</p><p>The philosophy is founded on quality relationships with tamariki, their parents and whƒÅnau along with the environment.</p><p>This is the service's first ERO evaluation since the ownership change in May 2018.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a play-based curriculum where sustainable practices are beginning to take shape. They make choices about their participation. Children are learning about caring for chickens and plants. They help gather vegetables and herbs from the large tunnel house that contributes to food prepared on the premises. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are woven through the programme with links made to the environment, particularly Papat≈´ƒÅnuku.</p><p>The calm, settled environment promotes children's exploration and creativity. They engage in play alongside others and are supported by attentive adults who demonstrate an interest in what children are doing and learning.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging is well promoted. Teachers work positively alongside parents and whƒÅnau to make children's experiences positive and purposeful. Parents share information about their children to support ongoing learning. Children's interests and previous experiences provide a good base to inform the curriculum. A sense of whanaungatanga is fostered.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have easy access to a well thought out environment where they can be active explorers. Teachers and parents regularly communicate to maximise infant's and toddler's sense of security and wellbeing.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers work alongside parents and external agencies to provide experiences that are inclusive of all children.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place. Systems and practices promote improvements for the benefit of children and whƒÅnau. Over time, appraisal has been inconsistently managed. The recent appointment of a new centre manager and the clear expectations for her performance should assist the service to continue to strengthen practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for leaders and teachers in this service are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to engage with parents, whƒÅnau MƒÅori and its Pacific community to deepen teacher's understanding of what educational success looks like for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build their knowledge, understanding and use of effective internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a place-based curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There are many useful systems in place to guide practice. Leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for the service, with guidance from PEG, are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>effectively monitor the implementation of the organisation's expectations and outcomes for children and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidate and embed the organisation's systems and processes and monitor the effectiveness of these through internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Mata Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>12 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
