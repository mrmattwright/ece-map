</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pohutukawa Preschool is a privately-owned, all-day education and care centre in Whakatane. The centre opened in August 2015. It is licenced for 75 children with a maximum of 35 under two years of age. There are currently 97 children on the roll, 33 of whom are MƒÅori. The centre is open longer hours to support parents' variable working hours. The owners provide equitable opportunities for all children by removing possible barriers to participation.</p><p>The centre philosophy is focussed on building strong, positive relationships, where everyone feels respected and included. The teachers' goal is to provide children with optimal social and emotional growth in a loving, caring, and safe environment. They aim to promote physical as well as intellectual development, while teaching the importance of being patient, kind, and self confident.</p><p>The preschool is organised into three age-related rooms, each with a lead teacher, one of whom is the pedagogical leader for the centre. The owner oversees all centre operations. With rapid growth in the centre roll since its opening, a number of relievers have been employed. This has contributed to a high turnover of staff.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Pohutukawa Preschool is welcoming to all children, their parents and whƒÅnau. Children benefit from respectful relationships with teachers. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and have fun as part of their learning. The purpose-built centre is well resourced and includes a wide range of sustainable, natural materials. High teacher-to-child ratios support opportunities for teachers to engage with children in their learning. Children play and learn in a supportive, caring environment.</p><p>Teachers encourage tuakana-teina interactions, whereby older children support younger children in their learning. They deliberately and effectively use positive guidance strategies to support children's social competency skills. Children are able to follow their interests and make choices about their learning. Transition processes in, through and beyond the centre are flexible and adapted for individual children. Children are confident, competent learners.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are integrated naturally across the curriculum. Children's learning is enhanced through participation in a range of excursions into the local community. They benefit from a curriculum that provides a range of opportunities and supports children to lead their learning. Teachers now need to consider the inclusion of more challenges in the programme and environment to extend the learning for all children.</p><p>Teachers develop positive relationships with parents. Regular communication enables parents to share children's experiences and routines from home, and their aspirations, learning goals and shared interests for children's learning and development. Portfolios record children‚Äôs engagement in the programme. Learning stories need to include the learning outcomes of children's goals, to show continuity of development and acknowledgement of parent aspirations. It would be beneficial to make the portfolios more readily accessible to both children and parents so they can share and celebrate learning.</p><p>Infants' and toddlers' individual needs are well provided for by caring and attentive teachers. The environment is carefully organised to facilitate children's individual learning goals. Planning processes support ongoing learning opportunities. Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments. Children's right to be informed about decisions that affect them is respected. Children under the age of two experience an environment that allows them space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Teachers incorporate many aspects of te ao MƒÅori into the curriculum. They include tikanga practices, waiata, karakia, Matariki celebrations and some te reo MƒÅori. A knowledgeable staff member is supporting teachers to build their capability. There are specific celebrations related to other cultures relevant to the children. Leaders and teachers have identified the need to build relationships with local iwi and hapu to further strengthen their responsiveness to children's language, culture and identity.</p><p>Leaders have a strong commitment to the vision, philosophy and goals of the centre. Planned and spontaneous internal evaluations lead to change and improvement in the quality of outcomes for children in various aspects of centre practice. Leaders provide professional development for teachers, with a view to building their capability. Shared leadership allows teachers to use each other‚Äôs strengths to develop practice. A thorough induction and mentoring process for teachers enables them to be aware of expectations and routines. Leadership practices reflect the right of all to a quality, inclusive early childhood education.</p><p>A strategic plan identifies the centre's priorities, some of which are linked to teaching and learning. The owner has effective policies and procedures in place to guide practice. Parents and whƒÅnau have the opportunity to have input into the centre's direction through regular whƒÅnau meetings.¬† A robust appraisal system is documented. The owner needs to ensure ongoing monitoring of the consistency of the implementation of the system.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and ERO agree priorities for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>link a shared understanding of high quality teaching and learning to all other aspects of centre practice. Expectations for practice should then provide an agreed direction for the centre</li>
<li>build leaders' skills to support teachers to implement the agreed expectations effectively.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pohutukawa Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pohutukawa Preschool will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato / Bay of Plenty</p><p>30 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
