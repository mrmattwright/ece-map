</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Curves Childcare Centre, located in Blockhouse Bay is a family owned service providing care and education for children from around two years old to five years of age. The centre is licensed for 39 children. The capable teaching team caters for individual children in a mixed age environment.</p><p>The centre is well led by the owner and has long term staff who are well qualified, effective practitioners. Staff continue to build strong partnerships with families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. The good features noted in the 2012 ERO report remain evident in this review. Managers promote ongoing centre improvement and have continued to develop self-review processes across centre operations. Programme evaluation has also improved and is contributing to strengthened teaching approaches and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show high levels of engagement in group and individual play. They have many choices within the broad range of opportunities provided. Teachers are proactive about and responsive to children‚Äôs interests, needs and strengths. They use questioning and conversations well to extend children‚Äôs thinking, knowledge and curiosity. Children are encouraged to participate in decision-making about programmes and routines.</p><p>The learning programme is based on <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and aligns well with the centre‚Äôs values and priorities. It incorporates bicultural perspectives that provide relevant learning contexts for MƒÅori and all other children. Teachers are clear about what they value in the curriculum. Te reo MƒÅori, waiata and tikanga are integrated in the programme and children are encouraged to participate in p≈çwhiri on special occasions. Children know the importance of powhiri for introducing and getting to know visitors.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively and use good processes for evaluating the effectiveness of the programme. Good records of this work show how teachers build on children‚Äôs interests and use these as the basis for the learning programme. Children are experiencing more consistent teaching approaches as staff build on and sustain their good practices.</p><p>The centre environment offers children appropriate indoor and outdoor challenges. The centre layout and equipment invites exploration and caters well for children's interests. Teachers encourage children‚Äôs creativity and make good use of centre resources to extend their learning. Literacy and mathematics concepts are incorporated in both indoor and outdoor activities and enhance children's learning through a variety of play.</p><p>Teachers communicate with parents, including MƒÅori whƒÅnau, about their aspirations for their children. They know parents well and are responsive to their feedback. Teachers' bicultural professional development has supported more meaningful interactions with MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau. A well-considered programme has been developed with neighbouring schools to support children‚Äôs transition from the centre to school.</p><p>The centre owner has a strategic approach to leadership and professional learning. She has developed good processes to enable teachers to reflect on the centre's provision, including opportunities for children in the mixed age group setting. Staff have many opportunities to participate in centre evaluation, develop their leadership skills, and make use of current education research. They have access to a range of professional learning opportunities to extend their own learning and qualifications.</p><p>Teacher development is guided by a good appraisal process that is well linked to the learning programme and centre goals.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Ongoing and well documented self-review occurs across all areas of centre operations. The annual management plan is comprehensive and relevant. Good processes are maintained for developing and reviewing centre policies and procedures. The effective management of health and safety practices is evident.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified relevant development priorities that include a refocus of the strategic plan to better reflect the centre‚Äôs long term direction. ERO supports the owner's goals to continue to distribute leadership opportunities within the staff and to continue strengthening the centre‚Äôs bicultural and transition to school programmes.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Curves Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Curves Childcare Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>19 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
