</table><p>Mornington Kindergarten¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mornington Kindergarten provides early childhood education, within an ethnically diverse community, for children aged over two years. Children participate in half or whole-day learning programmes between the hours of 8.30am and 2.30pm. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by four qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy states that 'teachers endeavour to provide an atmosphere that is caring, safe, encouraging, stimulating, equitable and fun'. Valued outcomes emphasise relationships, curiosity, language, culture, identity and child agency.</p><p>The kindergarten has sustained the effective practices noted in ERO's December 2015 report and has made very strong progress in areas identified for further development.</p><p>Mornington Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens administered by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). A general manager oversees the association, under the governance of a board. Senior teachers provide ongoing professional advice and guidance to each kindergarten on teaching and learning.</p><p>This review was one of 11 in Dunedin Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a strong sense of belonging and benefit from a high quality curriculum. They are confident and competent, capably leading their own learning, as well as supporting the learning of other children. There are high levels of engagement, ownership and autonomy of learning. Children have learning choices as well as opportunities to co-construct the curriculum.</p><p>The curriculum is broad, interesting, acknowledges prior learning, values home learning and promotes knowledge about different cultures. There is a good balance of child-led and teacher-led teaching and learning opportunities. Children are actively encouraged to take leadership roles.</p><p>Strong learning-focused partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau are evident. Relationships with children and their whƒÅnau and between adults are reciprocal and responsive. Parent voice is sought regularly and is valued by all teachers.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices are effective, well implemented and focused on learner outcomes. Teachers regularly discuss and plan for all individuals and groups of children. High levels of intentional teaching practices are evident but specific teaching strategies could be more clearly identified in the planning and reporting on learning.</p><p>The needs of diverse learners are well supported and prioritised. There is a well-established culture of social and emotional coaching by teachers to support the wellbeing of all children and their families. Leaders and teachers are particularly adept in identifying needs and sourcing and providing appropriate external support for children and their families.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is well aligned to core concepts and values of <span lang="mi">te ao MƒÅori</span>. These are very evident in the programme and teacher practices. Language, culture and identity are promoted for MƒÅori children and all other children.</p><p>Leadership is capable, collaborative and improvement focused. Teachers' skills are acknowledged, valued and professionally developed. Well organised systems and processes ensure that the learning environment is positive and efficient. Teachers are 'unhurried' and 'present' in the learning environments. They work thoughtfully alongside children, making quality observations to extend learning, promote autonomy and wellbeing. Transitions are personalised and well managed.</p><p>The DK board has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2015-2016 reviews. The mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. It has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. The board actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the teaching team are to further improve outcomes for learners through refinements to assessment, planning and evaluation processes by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly linking parents' aspirations to children's learning goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more clearly identifying teaching strategies and evaluating their impact on learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders should extend internal evaluation practices by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using a concise evaluative question to drive the evaluation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing specific outcomes, as part of the action planning phase of evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps for the kindergarten</h3><p>The board has identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to the board and each kindergarten's priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mornington Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement</p><p><span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span> (Southern Region)</p><p>28 April 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
