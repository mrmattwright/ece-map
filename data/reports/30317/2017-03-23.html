</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>George Street Childcare (previously Busy Time Childcare), is a privately owned service located in Matamata. It provides education and care for children from three months to school age. The centre is licensed for 45 children, including up to 19 aged under two. The roll of 91 includes eight Māori children. The centre operates a mixed-aged programme, with a separate area for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014, there has been a change of centre ownership and significant renovations to the buildings and playgrounds. In addition, the licence has been increased to 45 children, including 19 aged under two years. The centre's roll has grown, resulting in more appointments to the teaching team.</p><p>The leadership team has also been restructured along with the appointment of a new centre director and three new team leaders. Teachers have participated in professional learning, development in the areas of infant care and education, and self review.</p><p>The centre's draft philosophy makes a commitment to providing high quality care and education for children and their families in a safe, loving environment. The approach to teaching and learning represents the philosophy of Magda Gerber, promoting respect and trust in babies and toddlers to be active explorers and self learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme where there are many opportunities to engage in sustained play of their own choosing. A feature of the programme is strong tuakana/ teina relationships where older children are able to play alongside and support younger peers. Literacy and numeracy learning is naturally integrated through children's play. Māori children's language, culture and identity is promoted by the daily use of waiata, karakia at mat times, and appropriate tikanga Māori practices. Teachers are developing their confidence in their use of te reo Māori.</p><p>Children's learning is documented in attractively presented learning portfolios and an online format. There is a need to further develop the consistency of assessment and planning practices to better identify and respond to individual children's interests and learning, particularly for the older children.</p><p>There are many opportunities for parents to be involved and contribute to the life of the centre through their participation in special events and celebrations. Children's development as confident learners with high levels of independence and social skills, is effectively promoted through involvement in the programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy warm and affirming relationships with their teachers. The centre implements a primary caregiver process, where a specific teacher takes responsibility for undertaking all care routines for each individual child. This underpins a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging for very young children, and helps to establish meaningful partnerships with parents. A newly implemented 'Continuity of Care' system supports transitions into, and within the centre, particularly for infants and toddlers. Building on existing relationships with local schools would further strengthen transition processes for the older children.</p><p>Respectful teaching practices support positive outcomes for children. Teachers know children well and use this knowledge to build links with home experiences. They use a range of useful teaching strategies to promote children's oral language skills. Teachers are committed to ongoing learning and professional development. Children benefit from positive, respectful and reciprocal relationships with their teachers.</p><p>The centre owners provide supportive and well-informed governance. They have developed useful policies and processes to guide centre operations and meet legal requirements. They have provided useful external professional development for teachers and leaders. An effective teacher appraisal system has been developed and now needs to be fully implemented. Well-informed governance is contributing to ongoing centre improvement. Although useful guidelines for self review are documented, over the last year implementation of the process has become inconsistent. There is a need to develop a more systematic, in depth and centre wide-approach to self review. This is likely to support owners, leaders and teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of centre operations and make evidence-based decisions about ongoing improvement.</p><p>The centre director is knowledgeable about early childhood education, particularly for infants and toddlers. With support she will be able to assist the new leaders and teachers to grow in their professional knowledge and further promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are for the centre leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review, develop and implement an updated strategic plan, philosophy statement and curriculum. This focus is likely to promote teachers' capability to add complexity to children's learning, and in particular for older children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to access professional mentoring and support to strengthen their leadership capabilities. This assistance is likely to promote a more deliberate approach to building teacher capability. This should include a focus on strengthening leadership of learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of George Street Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of George Street Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>23 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
