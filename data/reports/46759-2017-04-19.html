</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Love and Learn Care &amp; Education is a privately owned, stand-alone service in Whanganui.  It is licensed for up to 40 children, including 12 aged up to two years. The centre opens for mixed-age sessions, five days a week. At the time of this review, 27 children identified as Māori.</p><p>The owner and a staff co-manager oversee business operations and the day-to-day teaching of the learning environment. Two senior teachers are leading self review and another staff member is responsible for the infants and toddlers. Three teachers are working towards full registration.</p><p>The service philosophy draws upon te ao Māori values. These include: manaakitanga - respect for tamariki, whānau, community and our environment; whakawhānaungatanga - building strong foundations for relationships with people, places and things; kotahitanga - working in partnership and collaboration; and, rangatiratanga - growth for the individual and striving to reach one's potential.</p><p><em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum guides and informs practices. The centre has a sustainability focus and is part of Enviroschools.</p><p>This is the first report for the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is highly evident in practice where being part of a learning community is promoted. The extensive outdoor environment offers a range of leaning activities for all children. They are supported to be physically active and engage in exploration, creative arts and role play which incorporates and fosters numeracy and literacy learning. Positive, reciprocal relationships with peers and adults are nurtured.</p><p>Empathy and care for one another is reflected through children's interactions. They are familiar with rituals and routines, enacting their own rhythms as they lead their learning to decide, engage and complete activities.  </p><p>A new approach to planning for learning for individuals and groups is being implemented. Individual parents' contributions clearly communicate their child's interests, strengths and goals. The curriculum is also informed by children's voice, their strengths and needs.</p><p>There is variability of teacher practice in the implementation of the process and documentation of planning. Providing clear expectations and moderating for consistency should strengthen the assessment for learning process and build shared understanding of good practice for teachers. Integrating and increasing early childhood approaches into the 'Think Tank' time should enhance children's learning.</p><p>Learning journals are attractively presented. These provide information about children's interests, learning, and progress over time. Teachers should continue to include and promote children's culture, language and identity in planning and assessment.</p><p>Te ao Māori values and beliefs are well reflected in the centre. Visual signposts include kupu Māori, artefacts, natural resources, books, puzzles and posters. Rituals appropriate for the centre are discussed, changed and woven through practices. Centre leaders acknowledge the need for members to continue to build te reo me ngā tikanga Māori capability.</p><p>An ethos of nurture and care affirms infants and toddlers as they engage fully in the programme. They are viewed as confident and competent learners. Teina are well supported by tuakana in collaboration and cooperative sharing of space.</p><p>Professional development has informed self review, leadership and systems documentation. A culture of continued improvement is modelled. Leaders have identified that building theirs and teachers' internal evaluation capability and capacity is an area for further development. ERO findings confirm this.</p><p>The appraisal process was introduced in 2016 and is yet to complete a cycle. It has the potential to enhance teacher’s professional growth and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that leaders and teachers should continue to build:</p><ul>
<li>internal evaluation capability</li>
<li>te reo me ngā tikanga Māori confidence and capability</li>
<li>shared understanding of assessment for learning.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Love and Learn Care and Education completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The early childhood service management should clarify with the Ministry of Education that they are meeting licensing requirements in using the unlicensed adjoining building.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Love and Learn Care and Education will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>19 April 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
