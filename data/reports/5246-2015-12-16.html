</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Putiki Kindergarten is situated in Whanganui. It is one of 14 kindergartens administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association (the association). Of the 32 children currently enrolled, 14 identify as MƒÅori. The kindergarten is licensed for 27 children aged over two years and offers six-hour sessions, five days per week. Three of the teachers are new since the September 2012 ERO report. All teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>At the time of this review the kindergarten had relocated to Whanganui East School while the premises were being repaired in the aftermath to the July 2015 floods. Teachers and the association have demonstrated resilience in response to adversity. The relocated and re-resourced service continues to provide a much needed early childhood facility for its community.</p><p>A governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the general manager, who is answerable to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of teachers. Two recently appointed cultural advisors support teachers to work with MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs key priorities for learning are strongly linked to the philosophy and evident in practice. These include: quality learning experiences; building children's social competence; acknowledging the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa; and fostering children's sense of belonging and inclusion<em>.</em></p><p>The programme is strongly focused on promoting positive learning outcomes for children. They are viewed as competent and capable learners and empowered to be independent. Teachers listen to and value children‚Äôs input, and enable them to contribute to decision making.</p><p>Cultural diversity is celebrated and a sense of belonging generated. The environment provides opportunities for challenge, risk taking and discovery. Relationships with families are valued. Children enthusiastically participate in the play-based programme and have fun.</p><p>Teachers know children well and support their interests. Literacy and numeracy are well resourced and integrated into learning experiences in meaningful ways.</p><p>The curriculum is child-led. Teachers support children to plan their own learning. Children are offered a high degree of choice throughout the day.</p><p>Relationships between teachers, children and their families are strong. Teachers are responsive and respectful. They engage well with children to support their self-chosen play and learning. They support children in authentic ways. Teachers maintain an unhurried, calm tone. As a result children are happy, confident and independent learners.</p><p>Teachers effectively notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs learning. Weekly planning meetings are used to share information about children‚Äôs emerging strengths and interests and plan strategies to add breadth and complexity to their learning. Evaluation of the impact of the planned strategies on children‚Äôs learning is a useful next step.</p><p>Children‚Äôs significant interests are recorded through learning stories. A next step is for teachers to evaluate how effectively they are recording progress in portfolios.</p><p>The environment celebrates what is valued here: children and their learning; the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand; families and whƒÅnau; and the local community. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are incorporated in teacher practice and centre routines. A fresh focus on<em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> should further enhance success for MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to supporting children when they start kindergarten. Teachers continue to develop positive links with local schools to assist children and families in making transitions. Teachers write a final learning story for children to take with them to school. They should continue to seek ways to share information about children‚Äôs learning with new entrant teachers.</p><p>Review is valued as a tool to promote improvement. Teachers‚Äô reflection and discussion is linked to improving outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers need to clarify their understanding and use of internal evaluation. They have identified the importance of further embedding the self-review framework to strengthen the quality of teaching and promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Kindergarten long-term plans strongly align with the association‚Äôs strategic priorities. The inclusion of the priorities for children‚Äôs learning identified by the kindergarten, should provide a stronger basis for review and development of practices that promote improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The senior teacher provides a range of support for teaching teams. She is considering further developing her approach to giving feedback and reporting to better meet kindergarten needs.</p><p>A useful appraisal process supports teachers to reflect on their practice in relation to professional teaching requirements. The leadership team is beginning to implement a revised approach across the association. This should include focused observations of teachers‚Äô practice in relation to their professional goals. Once the new approach is fully implemented, evaluation of its impact on teachers‚Äô development is a next step for the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team, with support from the association, should continue to develop its:</p><ul>
<li>approach to assessment</li>
<li>understanding and use of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Putiki Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Putiki Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 December 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
