</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><p></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mayfield Kindergarten is a well established service that provides education and care for children over two years old. The majority of children are of Māori or Pacific descent. The kindergarten has operated the kindergarten six-hour day model (KDM) for several years.</p><p>The kaupapa/philosophy of the kindergarten shows a strong commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi and bicultural practices, and to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The strengths and interests of tamariki drive their learning and determine planning for the learning environment. Reciprocal communication, respectful relationships with parents and whānau, and the holistic wellbeing of all children are also integral to the kaupapa.</p><p>There have been several changes in the teaching team, and the head teacher is the only full-time teacher who has remained at the kindergarten since the 2014 ERO review. The head teacher has worked positively with children and the community to minimise the impact of many staff changes. She has been resolute about maintaining a focus on children and the values of whanaungatanga and aroha. Changes over the past three years have reduced the progress able to be made in addressing the key next steps of ERO's 2014 report.</p><p>The administrator has worked in the kindergarten for six years and also supports children as a teacher aide. Two full-time, qualified teachers have been appointed since 2014, and a third full time, qualified teacher in May 2017. A teaching assistant was appointed this year. The teachers work as a collaborative team and have developed very good relationships with their community.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides a governance and management framework. Professional support personnel assist teachers with curriculum, management and property matters.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, capable learners. They settle quickly into the programme, have a strong sense of belonging and lead their own learning. Children independently select resources, and choose their favourite activities and areas of play. They have trusting relationships with adults and know how to get the help they need. Children's language development is well supported and they enjoy talking and communicating with adults and their peers. Children enjoy imaginative and dramatic play. They persevere, concentrate and engage in play for long periods of time.</p><p>Teachers know children well and have trusting relationships with them and their whānau. They skilfully engage children in play that prompts them to collaborate and investigate ideas. They use questions well to facilitate reciprocal conversations and challenge children's thinking.</p><p>Teachers are committed to integrating the cultures and special interests of Māori and Pacific children and ensure the environment reflects the languages and values of these cultures. Māori values and tikanga are evident in the environment and curriculum. Teachers integrate Samoan language and culture into the programme.</p><p>A commitment to employing regular relievers supports children to maintain close and trusting relationships with known adults. The learning environment is very well organised. It has inviting spaces and a range of resources and activities. Children enjoy and respond well to Māori and Pacific music, and also enjoy opportunities to sing and play musical instruments themselves. Children have easy access to resources that enable them to revisit their previous interests.</p><p>With support from the AKA education specialist, teachers have recently developed an effective, new approach to planning. It is based on children's interests, includes input from children and whānau, and shows the progression of planning. Teachers identify learning outcomes and teaching strategies, placing a deliberate focus on building children's knowledge and understanding of vocabulary. More complexity is evident in planning for older children. Programme evaluation now includes a review of learning outcomes and the effectiveness of teaching strategies.</p><p>The AKA has implemented strategies over the last three years to support the kindergarten with its staffing challenges. The operations manager and education specialist have made careful staff appointments that support the strategic direction of the kindergarten, and that focus on specific areas of expertise. Appraisal systems are well established and support teachers to critically reflect on and develop their professional practice.  A framework for internal evaluation now also guides ongoing improvement.</p><p>Kindergarten operations are guided by a comprehensive strategic plan and a shared vision, linked to the AKA’s strategic goals. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) also aligns with AKA and kindergarten strategic plans. It enables the AKA and teachers to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement. The AKA continues to review its management and leadership structure. It has begun a process of internal evaluation to establish how effectively the four pillars of its strategic plan are resulting in more positive outcomes for children, their families, and the organisation. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers agree that key next steps for teachers and leaders should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening assessment processes and documentation</li>
<li>continuing to build teachers' understanding and use of effective internal evaluation</li>
<li>building leadership capacity</li>
<li>reviewing and strengthening the documentation and implementation of business plans</li>
<li>continuing to consolidate and embed improve programme planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mayfield Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mayfield Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>14 September 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><i><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"></a></i><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
