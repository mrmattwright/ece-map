</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KidzZone Preschool and Education Centre is situated in the Tauranga coastal suburb of Otumoetai. It operates near two other centres under the same private ownership and governance. KidzZone provides parents with a choice of all day and sessional education and care for children from 3 months old to school age in three separate, age-based areas. The centre is licensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> for 42 children, including 17 children under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review there were 64 children on the roll including six children identified as MƒÅori and eight children under the age of two years.</p><p>Leaders and teachers aim to maintain positive partnerships with families and to teach children skills for life in aesthetically pleasing and natural environments. They have recently reviewed the centre philosophy, in consultation with families, to reflect the importance they place on providing a more natural and sustainable programme and environment for children‚Äôs learning and care.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, a teacher with experience in the centre has been appointed as centre supervisor. Teachers have participated in whole staff, relevant professional development. A significant upgrade to the outdoor environment has resulted in children having access to more natural and challenging learning areas. Recent self review about transition to school has included a focus on building closer relationships with local schools to support children and families to make positive transitions when they reach school age.</p><p>Centre management and teachers have made good progress with improving the areas for development identified in the June 2010 report. These areas included empowering children further in leading their learning and increasing the use of information and communication technologies in centre programmes and centre organisation. The centre identifies the need to continue to strengthen bicultural perspectives in the programme and teachers‚Äô confidence to further integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into their practice.</p><p>The centre maintains a high ratio of qualified staff to children and has a low staff turnover.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, families and teachers have established caring and respectful relationships amongst each other. MƒÅori tamariki and their families benefit from these close relationships and the emphasis placed on caring for children through flexible routines and access to the natural world. In addition, there are many opportunities to visit and interact with children and teachers in the other areas of the centre and build their social skills and competence amongst the mixed-age groups.</p><p>Infants are cared for in a safe and well-equipped environment that promotes exploration and independence. Teachers nurture and foster babies‚Äô sense of well being through gentle, unhurried and affectionate interactions. The curriculum builds on the current and identified strengths and interests of infants. Displays of children‚Äôs learning enable parents and whƒÅnau to share in their development and celebrate their successes. Babies have many opportunities to explore their creativity through a range of appropriate experiences. Teachers take them on trips and into the local community. They access the outdoors in a recently redesigned environment that provides opportunities for them to experience challenge and develop their physical confidence. Transitions within the centre are well planned, sensitively managed and contribute to a calm and settled environment.</p><p>Children‚Äôs transitions to the toddlers‚Äô area are based on their readiness. They display high levels of confidence as they explore and experiment alongside enthusiastic teachers. Teachers make time to enjoy positive interactions with children as individuals or in small groups. Toddlers participate in care routines that promote their independence and confidence as self-managing learners. They make choices from a suitable range of good quality equipment. Teachers foster a love of books for toddlers, share in stories, songs and creative activities that support their early concepts of literacy. The recently redesigned outdoor area is providing toddlers with increased opportunities to explore the natural world and use equipment in a variety of ways. Centre leaders and ERO agree there is a need for some teachers to continue to develop their understanding of responding to and extending children‚Äôs interests in the programme.</p><p>The preschool area is spacious and designed to foster opportunities for children to follow their own interests, make choices and persevere in their exploration and play. Children demonstrate high levels of enjoyment and enthusiasm in their learning. Teachers have fun as they promote children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills. Children are actively involved in decision-making about their learning. The programme is enriched with visits into the wider community. Teachers capitalise on nearby beaches and the natural environment for learning. One teacher is responsible for providing an extension programme for older children. She takes a planned approach to project-based learning with a focus on a particular interest area that is explored over time. Children have ready access to a good variety of equipment and materials to explore early concepts of literacy and numeracy. They investigate many ways to develop their creativity and express themselves through a variety of experiences.</p><p>While children‚Äôs generic interests are identified and displayed, a next step for teachers is to consider planning more specifically for experiences to extend individual children‚Äôs learning. Centre leaders agree there would also be benefit in developing effective systems and processes to give children and teachers greater access to stored equipment and resources.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning, development and participation in aspects of the programme are recorded in attractive individual portfolios. These are readily accessed by families and the older children. Parents participate in meetings and regular conversations with teachers about their children‚Äôs learning and care. Parents have opportunities to participate in parenting courses offered in the centre. They contribute their views and ideas in a variety of ways.</p><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the ideas, goals and aspirations that parents hold for their children could be more evident in the portfolios. Regular documented reflections from families and teachers would more clearly identify progress and celebrate children‚Äôs achievements. Teachers also need to consider ways of clearly reflecting each child‚Äôs language, culture and identity in profile books, programmes, resources and the environment.</p><p>Children with special needs participate fully alongside their friends in an inclusive programme. Centre leaders access appropriate specialist support and establish close partnerships with families to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre owner and the supervisor are providing well informed and effective governance and leadership. This is evident through:</p><ul>
<li>a recently reviewed philosophy that reflects the values that teachers and families hold for the education and care of children</li>
<li>well-understood, self-review processes, both planned and spontaneous, that lead to centre sustainability, development and improvement</li>
<li>effective performance management systems that focus on relevant and ongoing professional development</li>
<li>maintaining a collaborative leadership team that has a good understanding of their roles and responsibilities as leaders</li>
<li>systems and processes that contribute to a safe and healthy environment for children and teachers.</li>
</ul><p>The centre supervisor is a reflective practitioner. Strengths of her leadership observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>fostering emergent leadership amongst teachers that recognises their varying levels of knowledge and experience</li>
<li>modelling respectful and trusting relationships with children and adults</li>
<li>maintaining a culture where positive outcomes for children and their families are prioritised.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>An area for development identified in the 2010 ERO report continues to require attention. Priority should now be given to further developing:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural perspectives in centre operations, planning and the programme</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô knowledge and confidence to further integrate te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori into their practice.</li>
</ul><p>The centre owner has identified, and ERO agrees, the need to further align strategic plans to self review.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers participate in ongoing professional learning and development to continue strengthening their understanding of bicultural practices and partnerships that promote success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KidzZone Preschool and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KidzZone Preschool and Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>8 October 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
