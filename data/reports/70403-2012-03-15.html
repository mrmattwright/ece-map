The centre provides care and education for children from birth to five years.</p><p>The centre changed ownership in November 2011 from ABC to the Kidicorp Ltd. This is requiring the centre to review and use a range of new policies and procedures.</p><p>Since the March 2009 ERO review, there have been significant management and staff changes. The occupancy of the under two area has increased and managers and staff have responded by developing different areas of play and improved resourcing. However, ERO identified, and managers agree, there are some aspects of the premises that still need to be improved to provide all children with suitable learning spaces.</p><p>The managers have provided professional development for teachers. This support has helped them to improve the quality of programme planning and assessment of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Relationships between children, teachers and parents, and amongst staff are affirming and welcoming.</p><p>Children are provided with a good range of resources including computers to support a programme that effectively integrates te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>Other positive features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>a calm and well-managed learning environment</li>
<li>the way most teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>a good range of activities that engage and sustain children&rsquo;s interests.</li>
</ul><p>The centre managers identified, and ERO agrees that to further improve outcomes for children priorities should be given to embedding the philosophy, using the new guidelines for appraisal and extending the centre&rsquo;s long-term plan to include all aspects of centre development and self review.</p><p>Managers are effectively using self-review practices to improve outcomes for children. The centre provides a well-maintained environment for the health and safety of children and adults.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of ABC Developmental Learning Centre - Marchwiel was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atABC Developmental Learning Centre - Marchwiel.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The centre changed ownership in November 2011 from ABC to Kidicorp Ltd. This is requiring the centre to review and use a range of new policies and procedures. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on positive relationships, parent participation and encouraging children to interact, take on roles and develop relationships with others through play. This philosophy has not been reviewed since the new owners have taken over.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Teachers develop warm, positive and caring relationships with children. They support children to play cooperatively with each other. Teachers know children well, they notice and follow children&rsquo;s interests and engage in interesting conversations.</p><p>Teachers communicate effectively with each other and work well as a team. Professional development is helping staff to learn together and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre. They are given many opportunities to become involved with their children&rsquo;s learning and play.</p><p>Most teachers interact effectively with children to promote their thinking, learning and creativity. These teachers:</p><ul>
<li>respond to children&rsquo;s play and support them to develop social skills</li>
<li>listen well to children, use good questioning skills and help children to extend their language</li>
<li>celebrate children&rsquo;s learning successes.</li>
</ul><p>These interactions result in a calm and well-managed learning environment where children develop and engage in sustained play.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s programme gives children good opportunities to engage in interesting learning activities. These activities include a well-integrated focus on te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori, and literacy and numeracy. Children are provided with a good range of resources including computers to support the development of these skills.</p><p>Teachers are developing planning procedures that meet the needs of a range of individual and groups of children. Learning is well recorded in learning stories. Most examples show good links between teachers&rsquo; observations, programme planning and children&rsquo;s learning over time.</p><p>Managers use effective processes to make changes. These include improved group and kai times, transitions in the programme and the operation of the under two area. Managers and teachers report that these reviews have resulted in an improvement in the way children self select, make decisions and use their self-help skills.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The centre managers acknowledge and ERO agrees, that to further improve outcomes for children priorities should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>developing and introducing a shared philosophy so that it can become the basis of future self reviews</li>
<li>extending the long-term plan to include all aspects of centre development and self review</li>
<li>using the new guidelines for appraisal.</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified, and managers agree, that there is a need to review how the premises can be better developed to fully support all aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and development. At the time of the review, there was no separate developed outdoor area for under two-year-old children.</p><p>The outdoor environment limits older children&rsquo;s opportunities for physical challenge, and exploration.</p><p>The centre adjoins a large gym room. This room is not included on the license and requires the centre to use it as an excursion activity. The managers need to review how this area can be more effectively used to support children&rsquo;s ongoing learning and development.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of ABC Developmental Learning Centre - Marchwiel completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><p>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</p><p>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</p><p>staff qualifications and organisation</p><p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

However, ERO identified, and managers agree, there are some aspects of the premises that still need to be improved to provide all children with suitable learning spaces.</p><p>The managers have provided professional development for teachers. This support has helped them to improve the quality of programme planning and assessment of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Relationships between children, teachers and parents, and amongst staff are affirming and welcoming.</p><p>Children are provided with a good range of resources including computers to support a programme that effectively integrates te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>Other positive features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>a calm and well-managed learning environment</li>
<li>the way most teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>a good range of activities that engage and sustain children&rsquo;s interests.</li>
</ul><p>The centre managers identified, and ERO agrees that to further improve outcomes for children priorities should be given to embedding the philosophy, using the new guidelines for appraisal and extending the centre&rsquo;s long-term plan to include all aspects of centre development and self review.</p><p>Managers are effectively using self-review practices to improve outcomes for children. The centre provides a well-maintained environment for the health and safety of children and adults.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p></html>
