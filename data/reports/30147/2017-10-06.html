</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Campus Creche at Fraser, formerly Frasers Little Feet, is located on the Fraser High School Campus, attached to He Puawai, the Teen Parent Unit. It is an all-day education and care service for children from birth to school age. There are separate indoor and outdoor spaces for children up to two years of age and for those over two. At the time of this review 40 children were enrolled, 23 of MƒÅori descent and seven from Pacific cultures.</p><p>In May 2016 the Campus Creche Trust took over governance and management responsibilities of the centre. The centre now operates under Campus Creche philosophy. Through this philosophy the centre acknowledges the importance of the Treaty of Waitangi, collaboration with parents and providing tamariki with sustained and meaningful learning experiences. The centre also aims to provide natural, spacious environments where children are safe and secure, and have opportunities to explore and learn alongside others.</p><p>Campus Creche provides comprehensive policy guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management, and administrative support for the centre.</p><p>The previous ERO report in February 2016, identified next steps in relation to governance and management, professional leadership, teacher appraisal, teaching practice and curriculum implementation, including assessment, planning and evaluation. The centre has benefited from ongoing Ministry of Education support through the Strengthening Early Learning Outcomes (SELO) programme, as well as clear direction from the Campus Creche Trust. Good progress has been made in improving governance, management, centre leadership and some aspects of the curriculum. There is a need to continue to strengthen teachers' practice and curriculum implementation.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO review, a new centre manager has been appointed and there have been significant changes to the leadership and teaching team. The team is made up of trained and untrained teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Campus Creche Trust is providing effective governance and management for the centre. The director works in a close and professional relationship with the centre manager and staff. The Trust provides focused professional learning, development and support for staff. It now includes a parent representative from He Puawai, formalising the voice of these parents in decision making about centre operations and direction. Useful policies, guidelines and a robust appraisal system supports teachers' practice and centre health and safety procedures. The Trust and centre leaders have a strategic approach to promoting improved learning outcomes for all children, this includes individualised support for children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Self review is well developed. This is evident at all levels of centre operations. Particular strengths of self review include responding to external evaluation, making use of research and current theory and teacher reflections about their practice. These effective systems for self review are leading to ongoing centre development and improvements to teachers' practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>Children, families and staff are benefitting from effective professional leadership. The centre manager has successfully built strong relational trust among teachers, children and the parent community with a focus on whanaungatanga and manaakitanga. MƒÅori children and their families are affirmed in their culture through the use of te reo MƒÅori, waiata, sharing stories and visiting places of local significance. A feature of relationships is enhanced communication and collaboration between the centre and He Puawai parents and staff. There is shared leadership across the centre which is contributing to a consistent team approach to supporting children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Some good practices observed by ERO were:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>approachable teachers who are warm and welcoming to children and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular opportunities for children to explore the wider community, including natural world exploration and sustainable planting in local reserves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interactions with children up to two years where teachers respond to individual routines and preferences in a strong culture of care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the 'key teacher' system that provides responsive transitions, continuity of care for children and communication with parents and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the introduction of an online portal that has increased opportunities to share children's wellbeing and learning with whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a more intentional approach to planning and assessment in response to individual children's interests and needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children have time and space to make choices, express their ideas and explore with their friends in a positive secure environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps for ongoing centre development are to continue to build teacher knowledge and understanding of best practice in early childhood education. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing clear and shared expectations for teaching practice and curriculum implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing coaching, mentoring and targeted feedback to teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved opportunities for children to engage in meaningful, sustained and increasingly complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>urgent consideration to meaningful integration of literacy, mathematics and science in the context of children's play and exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a stronger emphasis on, and response to, the languages, cultures and identities of children and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these areas for development is likely to support teachers to gain a shared understanding to fully enact the intent of the Campus Creche philosophy.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Campus Creche at Fraser completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Campus Creche at Fraser will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>6 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
