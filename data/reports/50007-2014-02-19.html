</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stratford Playcentre is a community-based service that caters for up to 30 children from birth to school age, in two sessions each week. The current roll of 22 children is growing after a period of decline.</p><p>The centre philosophy highlights the role of parents as children’s first teachers, and the importance of their involvement in supporting the programme. Following the Annual General Meeting in October 2013, most of the elected office holders, including the president are new to their roles.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 parent-led services governed under the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association) umbrella. The governance of these centres has recently reverted to a structure where all centre representatives contribute to association decisions and priorities.</p><p>Many of the areas identified for development in the 2010 ERO report still require improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families demonstrate a clear sense of belonging in a supportive and inclusive centre atmosphere. Guidance and mentoring from association support staff are having a positive impact on team morale, the environment and learning and safety for children. New members and their families are actively welcomed and supported by office holders.</p><p>Centre leaders are focused on improving the quality of education and care for children. They are beginning to use self review to improve teaching and learning. Policy framework review and updating details of annual planning goal are identified as priorities for the recently elected committee and office holders.</p><p>Parent members access professional learning and development to increase their individual and collective capability in planning and evaluation. All recently enrolled parent members are encouraged and supported to participate in course workshops and training to gain appropriate parent-educator qualifications.</p><p>Children benefit from parents' interactions and support with their play and learning. Older children support and interact positively with infants and toddlers during play and meal times. The babies' and infants’ area is well used. Suitable resources and a calm environment promote nurturing and positive interactions with young children.</p><p>Members are being progressively introduced to useful processes to identify and respond to children’s interests. Recent association-led workshops and training have improved parents' understanding and use of planning and evaluation strategies. As a result, programme planning is becoming more responsive to individual children’s interests and strengths.</p><p>Parents are developing their capability in assessment of learning and recording children’s progress and development. Some parent educators are beginning to record children’s learning and progress over time in profile books. Further support and development to sustain improvement in this area is planned by the association for 2014.</p><p>Children are encouraged to explore and take risks in a supportive environment with high parent ratios. Those children with special needs are identified and supported to follow their interests. Further development of programmes and provision for supporting older children to transition to school is required.</p><p>Both Stratford Playcentre and the association have annual plans that inform operational decisions. However, there are few links between the association and individual playcentre goals. The association’s strategic vision is yet to effectively focus on priorities for improving teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre is at the early stages of ensuring children have experiences that assist them to become confident in Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. These developments are supported by the Puriri W’akamaru o Taranaki role that was established by the association to build bicultural understandings. Acknowledged next steps are to develop strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori.</p><p>Visits and support by association personnel have increased in response to needs in the latter half of 2013. Positive relationships between playcentre personnel and those in support roles are evident. The association offers opportunities for parents to train in the playcentres’ early childhood education courses. Extending and improving the support the association offers to playcentres is an important next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders should continue to access appropriate support and resources through the association to develop and deliver an action plan for 2014 to increase parents' understanding and confidence in:</p><ul>
<li>use of bicultural perspectives in planning and programmes</li>
<li>wider provision for supporting older children to transition to school</li>
<li>review of policies, programmes and philosophy so they meet current expectations and best practices.</li>
</ul><p>The association would benefit from external support to strengthen and improve its understanding in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>annual and strategic planning that better informs priorities for teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relevant approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fostering opportunities for Māori children and whānau to have success as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting members' understanding of teaching and learning and regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>current self-review approaches.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stratford Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stratford Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
