</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Howick Baptist Church Kindergarten is a well established centre with an all-day licence for up to 40 children. The centre offers five morning sessions and four afternoon extension sessions for three to five-year old children. It is governed by a management team that includes a representative of the church, Chairperson, centre manager, administrator and parents. It is staffed by nine qualified teachers who have worked together for over four years, and an administrator.</p><p>A strong Christian ethos is an integral part of the philosophy, and centre operations and the curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The centre serves an increasingly multicultural community in Howick. The kindergarten emphasises the value of communication and building partnerships with the whole family to achieve good quality learning outcomes for their children.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the management team has redeveloped the outdoor play area and created a natural looking all-weather play space. They have increased the number of afternoon sessions and increased children's access to technology. Teachers have engaged in whole centre and individual professional learning that include a focus on bicultural practice, teaching as inquiry, and children's transition to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in this centre have fun, engage in sustained play and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. They are confident, have a strong sense of belonging, and respect for themselves and others. Children have good opportunities to explore, solve problems and make choices about their play. They know teachers' expectations, have a positive attitude to learning, and relate well to others. Children are eager, capable learners who understand concepts of fairness and responsibility.</p><p>Respectful, supportive relationships and a relaxed atmosphere underpin the centre‚Äôs welcoming and inclusive tone. Managers and staff value community involvement in the centre. Parents/whƒÅnau receive good information about their children's learning and are encouraged to take an active part in the centre's programme and events.</p><p>Teachers know children well, listening carefully and encouraging them to talk about their ideas. They are responsive to children‚Äôs ideas, needs and preferences. Teachers interact sensitively with children to support and build on the learning in their play.</p><p>Teachers foster children's English language development and affirm the use of children's home languages during play. Some teachers talk with children in their home languages. Teachers provide good opportunities for children to develop their physical skills, and nurture their creativity and imagination. Science, literacy and mathematics concepts are also integrated through play and planned activities.</p><p>Teachers plan a balance of child and teacher-led activities. They provide a well resourced, carefully organised environment. Displays reflect the centre's values and the use of New Zealand Sign Language. Teachers acknowledge MƒÅori as tangata whenua. They are increasing their use of te reo MƒÅori and their understanding of tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers are keen to further develop bicultural practices and to strengthen support for children's home languages and cultural identities.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively as a team, with a high degree of relational trust. They have high expectations and are beginning to use self review to reflect on, and identify ways to improve, their practice. Professional development is encouraged, as are opportunities to share and build teachers' leadership capability.</p><p>Managers have a strong commitment to providing a high quality service. They encourage a culture of teacher reflection, sharing good practice and ongoing improvement. Centre operations are guided by a considered approach to management and governance. The centre's philosophy, currently under review by staff, is evident in all aspects of the centre. Strengthening the strategic plan would help the management team to evaluate their success in achieving the newly developed centre vision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the recognition of children's cultural identity in assessment portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing self review to include a focus on progress towards the service's vision, philosophy and strategic direction</p>
</li>
<li>strengthening the staff appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Howick Baptist Church Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Howick Baptist Church Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
