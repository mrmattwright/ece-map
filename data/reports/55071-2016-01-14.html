</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Porangahau Playcentre is located in the rural community of Porangahau in Central Hawkes Bay. The centre is open for two morning sessions per week. It is licensed for 30 children, including fifteen children up to two years of age. Parents stay with their children. The playcentre is located in a purpose-built facility across the road from the local school.</p><p>Since the February 2012 ERO report, the roll has increased considerably. The current roll is 64, with ten children identifying as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is managed as a parent cooperative with support from experienced personnel from the Central Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association (the association).</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Central Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy aims to empower and support children and adults to play, work, learn and grow together by providing a welcoming environment for all. This is highly evident in the programme.</p><p>Children and their parents know each other well. A sense of community is apparent as they arrive and set up the environment for the day‚Äôs session. Children quickly settle and immerse themselves in their activity of choice. They initiate their own play and work in collaboration with each other to share equipment and resources.</p><p>Children are well supported by adults. A shared responsibility for the children is visible. Parents engage in conversation with the children, model language and demonstrate a sense of fun.</p><p>The thoughtful placement of resources and activities is responsive to different age groups. Children have choices and are able to explore, investigate and be creative. A comfortable and safe space is provided for children who are not yet mobile.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. There is a planned approach to supporting parents‚Äô understanding of how to document children‚Äôs learning in relation to <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> Parents notice and recognise children‚Äôs emerging interests and plan activities and resources accordingly. Session evaluations capture children‚Äôs interests and aim to provide continuity from one session to another. Parents have identified the need to align session evaluation and planning to better identify and document the learning that is occurring for individual children.</p><p>Profiles are attractive. They capture and celebrate children‚Äôs involvement and engagement in centre activities and the wider community.</p><p>There is a strong commitment to promoting te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the centre. This is reflected through the philosophy, wall displays, resources, routines and the use of te reo in authentic contexts. Parents acknowledge the need to continue to build bicultural practices and to strengthen strategies to support MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Close proximity to the local school and positive reciprocal relationships supports children‚Äôs transition.</p><p>Parents are strongly committed to the Playcentre philosophy. They work collaboratively and support each other to take on leadership roles. The range of knowledge and skills that parents have is valued and celebrated. Some useful systems and processes have been developed to keep everyone informed, induct new parents and to support succession and sustainability.</p><p>Parents are encouraged and supported to work towards a Playcentre qualification. The association has identified that parent education is a priority. A new education convenor has been appointed.</p><p>Parents‚Äô understanding of self review is developing. There is an established framework which guides the process and results in improvement. Members have identified the need to continue to develop their knowledge and understanding of self review. The association is providing professional learning and development to support this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Parents are committed to the ongoing improvement of the centre. Members and ERO have agreed that there is a need for members, with the support of the association, to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop their understanding and use of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>engage with Playcentre training</li>
<li>build bicultural practices and strengthen strategies to support MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau</li>
<li>strengthen and embed knowledge and understanding of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Porangahau Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Porangahau Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
