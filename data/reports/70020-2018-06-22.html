</table><p>Ashley Playcentre is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ashley Playcentre operates under the guidance of the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative, where parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and centre operation. A centre support worker works with the parent group to support the curriculum, relationships, parent education and good health and safety practices. A centre administration team has been appointed to assist centres with administration, including health and safety.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy gives emphasis to parents as first and best teachers, and the provision of a play-based curriculum. Parents are encouraged to participate in playcentre education training to assist them in providing a parent-led early learning service.</p><p>Ashley Playcentre is in a semi-rural setting and operates five morning sessions a week. The parent group provides early childhood education for children aged from birth to school age. Infants, toddlers and young children play and learn in a mixed age-group setting.</p><p>Since the July 2014 ERO review, the parent group has made good progress in improving the quality of assessment and planning for individual children, and documenting future goals, plans and progress to ensure the ongoing improvement of the programme and learning for all children. The appraisal process for coordinators remains an area to further develop and fully implement.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review, the playcentre was being led by two coordinators who share the responsibility for supporting the parent-group. All office-bearing roles on the committee have been filled by a responsive and committed parent-group.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews within the national organisation of the Canterbury Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The parent group and coordinators warmly welcome families and foster positive and reciprocal relationships. They model care and respect (manaakitanga) for one another, the children and parents, which helps children and their families to develop a good sense of belonging. The language, culture and identity of families are respected and valued.</p><p>Children are happy and engaged and at the heart of all decision making. They benefit from a child-led, play-based curriculum that provides freedom of choice and long periods of uninterrupted time to develop their ideas. A wide range of interesting resources and learning experiences are made available to children to inspire their curiosity and encourage exploration. Planned excursions into the local community enrich the curriculum offered to children.</p><p>During the on-site stage of the review, ERO observed explicit teaching for oral language to extend on children's vocabulary, thinking, reasoning and social skills. Adults promote tuakana teina, encouraging older children to play with and help younger children.</p><p>The parent group demonstrates a commitment to developing understandings of bicultural perspectives and growing practices that are respectful of the MƒÅori culture.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy is highly evident in practice. Parents are valued as first educators of their children. Parents actively participate in playcentre professional development. This professional development grows confidence and understanding of children's development. Parents are empowered to take collective responsibility for children's learning, wellbeing, and the effective operation of the service.</p><p>Parents are reflective and make good use of strategic planning and internal evaluation to support ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children. A range of effective communication strategies are well used to ensure a collaborative approach to assessment, planning and documenting of children's learning interests.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><h4>For Ashley Playcentre</h4><p>The parent group has identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps to build on good practices are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural perspectives in practices and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage and involve all parents in the playcentre training to provide ongoing support for children's learning, including assessment and internal evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Canterbury Playcentre Association</h4><p>Canterbury Playcentre Association is undertaking major restructuring, including the amalgamation of some regions and improving systems and processes. The centre support team now has more defined roles. The centre support person provides guidance with strategic direction, internal evaluation and curriculum. The centre administration role has been developed to provide centres with administration support, including the oversight of health and safety. The centre support team provides a vital link between the parent group and Playcentre Aotearoa.</p><h4>Key Next Steps for Canterbury Playcentre Association</h4><p>The Canterbury Playcentre Association is undertaking major restructuring, including the amalgamation of some regions and improving systems and processes.</p><p>The key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embed the new governance and management structure and processes and, over time, review the effectiveness of these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support parents as first teachers and increase understandings of Te WhƒÅriki 2017</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the long-term strategic goal for te ao MƒÅori is successfully implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support centre support workers and centre administration teams to work effectively and provide consistent quality assurance and reporting processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop and fully implement appraisal processes and provide quality professional development for leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update policies and procedures, including the requirements of the Vulnerable Children's Act, and ensure these are distributed and well understood at each playcentre.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ashley Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ashley Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>22 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
