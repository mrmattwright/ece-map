</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Kilbirnie is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>Full time education and care is provided for 26 children, including 10 aged up to two. Of a roll of 35, no children identify as MƒÅori. A centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre. She is supported by a business and professional services manager.</p><p>The February 2014 ERO supplementary review report, identified that there was an urgent need to embed and sustain high quality teaching practices. These included: planning for learning; incorporating te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori; promoting educational success for MƒÅori children; support for children with additional needs, including those aged up to two; and self review. Progress in these areas is evident.</p><p>In the past two years a Montessori-trained centre manager has been appointed. This has provided stability for the teaching team.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three in BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have access to a learning environment that promotes their independence. A wide range of learning experiences is provided. They work individually or with their peers engaging in sustained play. Respectful practice by both teachers and children is highly evident.</p><p>Teachers know children well and draw on this information to support and extend their learning. Literacy, mathematics, science and geography are valued and highly promoted. Using intentional teaching strategies to respond to all opportunities to challenge children's learning is a centre wide focus.</p><p>Children with additional needs are identified and supported. External agencies are accessed when required.</p><p>Children up to the age of two are well supported. There are comfortable, safe spaces for those who are not yet mobile. Teachers have an unhurried, respectful approach. They respond to children's verbal and non-verbal cues with descriptive language to promote and extend vocabulary. Soft relaxing music promotes a sense of calm.</p><p>Transitions for children into, through and out of the centre are well considered. Teachers' relationships with local schools and collaboration with parents, along with participation in a BestStart initiative, support children's transition to school.</p><p>Through undertaking professional learning and development, teachers are developing a clearer understanding of a how they can integrate the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki -</em> the early childhood curriculum and the Montessori philosophy. Leaders acknowledge that this continues to evolve. ERO's evaluation affirms this finding.</p><p>Children contribute to the development of the planned programme that is responsive to their interests. Specific teaching strategies support their learning. Regular entries in their profile books provide information about engagement in the programme and developing friendships. A new on-line programme gives parents opportunities to provide feedback about their children's entries.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that teachers' approach to assessment requires further strengthening to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>how parents' aspirations are used to inform the planned programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>progression of learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have engaged in professional development to further their understanding of a bicultural curriculum. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are evident throughout the centre. Waiata MƒÅori are popular with children. Culturally significant events are celebrated.</p><p>Staff are building their understanding of ways to promote educational success for MƒÅori learners. Links with a local marae are contributing to this understanding.</p><p>Thoughtful consideration has been given to reflecting the cultural backgrounds of children and their families throughout the centre. Leaders have identified that support is required to improve teachers' understanding of the <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017.</em> ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment and has a developmental focus. Formal observations of practice are providing useful information about the quality of teaching. BestStart provides opportunities for teachers to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>Teachers' implementation of self review is guided by BestStart's collaborative and reflective processes. Planned and spontaneous reviews are well-established practices. Teachers' understanding of the purpose and impact on enhancing outcomes for children's learning is developing. To strengthen internal evaluation processes teachers should undertake more in-depth analysis of the evidence collected to inform their judgements about quality of practices, and to determine the impact of changes on outcomes for children.¬†</p><p>A professional service managers (PSM) provides regular in-depth feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. Strengths and areas for development are clearly identified. The PSM, in partnership with the teaching team, should continue to monitor the effective implementation of the areas identified for ongoing improvement in this evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the integration <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and Montessori curricula</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knowledge and understanding of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' and leaders' capability in understanding and using internal evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Kilbirnie completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Kilbirnie will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 February 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
