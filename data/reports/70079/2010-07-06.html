<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Leithfield Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre operates within the constitution of the association. The treasurer of the association is also the licensee of all Canterbury playcentres.</p>
<p>The association offers parents opportunities to train in playcentre early childhood education. The association expects all parents to take responsibility and shared leadership of the day-to-day operation of the playcentre.</p>
<p>The centre operates out of a community building in the Leithfield township and is open for two sessions each week. The playcentre building is also used by other community users outside of the playcentre session times. A small group of parents and coordinators works together effectively to provide an enjoyable and interesting learning environment and programme. They focus on making ongoing improvements to the programme.</p>
<p>ERO identified that children are benefiting from:</p>
<ul><li>welcoming and affirming relationships with adults and other children;</li>
<li>interactions with adults that support and extend their interests, learning and oral language development;</li>
<li>access to a good range of resources and learning experiences; and</li>
<li>babies and toddlers having full opportunities to be involved in all aspects of the playcentre programme.</li>
</ul><p>Parents are aware that their next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>review kai routines to ensure that these are helping children to develop an understanding of healthy practices;</li>
<li>improve assessment and programme planning practices; and</li>
<li>make more use of self review to determine the effectiveness of aspects of the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The parent group has efficient systems for monitoring health and safety. However, parents need to develop better ways of identifying and communicating hazards.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>Review Priorities</span></h2>
<a id="the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>The Focus of the Review</h2>
<p>Before the review, the management of Leithfield Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLeithfield Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<a id="2-the-quality-of-education" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2. The Quality of Education</span></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The playcentre philosophy is based on the belief that parents are the first educators of their children. It also states that children‚Äôs learning is enhanced when parents and children learn and grow together. Children‚Äôs learning through play is valued. Children are encouraged to explore their environment making the own choices about how and where to play.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<p>Relationships between children and adults are warm, positive and affirming. Children confidently initiate contact with other adults as well as their own parents. Adults regularly join in children‚Äôs play. They appear to know individual children well and have fun together.</p>
<p>Children are well supported in developing friendships. Children play well together. Parents recognise when children are learning from each other (tuakana teina) and foster these interactions. ERO observed regular cooperative and small group play, particularly among older children. Adults model positive relationships and help children to share, take turns and use their manners.</p>
<p>Parents have created a friendly and welcoming environment. Many parents stay during sessions. The playcentre provides good opportunities for developing community links and fostering friendships among families. Parents regularly talk about children‚Äôs learning. Parent strengths are effectively used within the programme. Parents told ERO that they value the opportunities the playcentre provides for them to play alongside their children.</p>
<h3>Interactions</h3>
<p>Children benefit from good quality interactions with all adults. Adults build on children‚Äôs previous knowledge and follow their leads and interests in play. Children have many opportunities to use and develop their speaking and listening skills. They have sustained conversations with adults who ask them questions, encourage them to talk about their play and ideas, give them time to explain their ideas and respond positively to them.</p>
<h3>Programme and environment</h3>
<p>Children are well engaged in a programme that recognises and supports their interests. Resources are effectively organized and easily accessible. Children can make choices about what they want to play with and for how long. Adults are responsive to children‚Äôs interests. They provide opportunities for children to extend their ideas by providing extra resources and equipment or by rearranging the centre layout. ERO observed children spending considerable time at activities that captured their attention and interest.</p>
<p>Children benefit from a wide range of learning activities. Some aspects of the programme, such as music and science, are well integrated. Children‚Äôs dramatic play and other creative and expressive activities are well supported. Other experiences include visitors to the playcentre and some excursions, in the local community and outside the area.</p>
<p>Children under two are included in the playcentre programme. Parents provide safe play spaces for these children who also make good use of the whole environment. All adults regularly interacted with toddlers and treated them as competent and capable learners.</p>
<h3>Philosophy in action</h3>
<p>The parent group works well as a parent collective and has developed an increased focus on centre improvement. Parents know their roles and share responsibilities for the efficient running of the centre and programme. Some adults have a good understanding of how to assess and record children‚Äôs learning and can share this practice with others. Parents are making increasing use of self review to focus on centre improvement. They attend association workshops to improve their knowledge and understanding of assessment, self review, and other practices.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<h4>Kai routines</h4>
<p>Some actions ERO observed during the morning tea routine did not help children to understand the importance of healthy practices. For example, children were not always encouraged to wash their hands, and some children were wandering about eating food. The kai tables had activities on them at the same time as food. It was also unclear how parents had taken into consideration aspects of tikanga MƒÅori in kai routines. Adults need to review the kai routine to ensure it supports children in developing an understanding of healthy practices.</p>
<h4>Assessment and programme planning</h4>
<p>The parent group has identified, and ERO agrees, that assessment and programme planning practices could be improved. Entries in the evaluation book do not regularly identify and plan for children‚Äôs learning. Profile books show a wide variation in the quality of assessments. Parents are currently focusing on improving the quality of learning stories. They are working on recognising learning better and using this information to plan the programme.</p>
<h4>Extending self review</h4>
<p>Parents could now use their new self-review processes to focus on other aspects of the programme. These include reviewing how well:</p>
<ul><li>children‚Äôs problem-solving skills are supported;</li>
<li>the placement of some equipment supports aspects of learning, especially when parents have to unpack and pack away all the equipment each session; and</li>
<li>the centre programme and environment reflect and support bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3. National Evaluation Topic</span></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Literacy Teaching and Learning</h3>
<p>When children understand, enjoy, engage with, and use language and symbols they are better able to express their individual identity and become active participants in a literate society. As part of this review, ERO looked at literacy practices, particularly the opportunities provided for children to develop strong literacy learning foundations.</p>
<p>In this service children‚Äôs literacy learning opportunities included:</p>
<ul><li>the availability of reading and writing materials;</li>
<li>a range of books including reference books;</li>
<li>meaningful routines that include literacy activities, such as name tags for children to name their own lockers on arrival;</li>
<li>parents modelling the writing of names on paintings and encouraging older children to make their own attempts;</li>
<li>regular opportunities to develop oral language through sustained conversations with adults; and</li>
<li>exposure to stories, written by their parents, with significance to the daily programme and children‚Äôs interests.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Leithfield Playcentre completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review, ERO identified one area of non-compliance. The parent group needs to formalise systems for identifying and communicating hazards.</p>
<p>In order to address this, centre management must ensure that:</p>

<ul><li>there are in place effective methods for systematically identifying existing hazards to employees at work; and systematically identifying new hazards to employees at work; and regularly assessing each hazard identified and determining whether or not it is a significant hazard.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>In addition, the parent group should seek further information to be assured that the elevated water tank in the playground is not a safety risk in the event of an earthquake.</p>

<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Leithfield Playcentre</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office‚Äôs latest report on Leithfield Playcentre.</p>
<p>Leithfield Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre operates within the constitution of the association. The treasurer of the association is also the licensee of all Canterbury playcentres.</p>
<p>The association offers parents opportunities to train in playcentre early childhood education. The association expects all parents to take responsibility and shared leadership of the day-to-day operation of the playcentre.</p>
<p>The centre operates out of a community building in the Leithfield township and is open for two sessions each week. The playcentre building is also used by other community users outside of the playcentre session times. A small group of parents and coordinators works together effectively to provide an enjoyable and interesting learning environment and programme. They focus on making ongoing improvements to the programme.</p>
<p>ERO identified that children are benefiting from:</p>
<ul><li>welcoming and affirming relationships with adults and other children;</li>
<li>interactions with adults that support and extend their interests, learning and oral language development;</li>
<li>access to a good range of resources and learning experiences; and</li>
<li>babies and toddlers having full opportunities to be involved in all aspects of the playcentre programme.</li>
</ul><p>Parents are aware that their next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>review kai routines to ensure that these are helping children to develop an understanding of healthy practices;</li>
<li>improve assessment and programme planning practices; and</li>
<li>make more use of self review to determine the effectiveness of aspects of the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The parent group has efficient systems for monitoring health and safety. However, parents need to develop better ways of identifying and communicating hazards.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre‚Äôs self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education ‚Äì including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities ‚Äì other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics ‚Äì This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements ‚Äì assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
