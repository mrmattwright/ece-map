<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Au Pair Link, Bay of Plenty 1 is a home-based care service that provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age across the Bay of Plenty. There is currently a roll of sixteen children, all of whom are New Zealand P&#257;keh&#257;/European.</p><p>The service is owned by Au Pair Link Limited which maintains a number of home-based care licences across the country. Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 began operating in 2009 and this is the first ERO review of the service.</p><p>The service recruits au pairs from overseas and facilitates their placement in children&rsquo;s homes, where they live in. Au pairs provide care and education for children, supported by a programme manager who is a qualified early childhood teacher.</p><p>The programme manager provides effective personal and professional support for au pairs, children and their families. Well-informed guidance and educational leadership is provided by a national education manager who is also a qualified and experienced early childhood teacher.</p><p>Particular strengths of the service identified in this review are:</p><ul>
<li>comprehensive, well documented, high quality management systems and procedures to guide all aspects of service operations, including health and safety;</li>
<li>positive, affirming relationships and effective communication between the programme manager, au pairs, children and their families; and</li>
<li>strong support by the programme manager in assisting au pairs to provide a balanced, stimulating learning programme for children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the service agree that priorities for further review and development are about supporting children to initiate their own learning and play and the quality of observations of learning recorded in portfolios.</p><p>In a relatively short period of time, a sound basis for the service has been established. Commitment to self review, reflective practice and continual improvement, mean that the service is well placed to sustain ongoing development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAu Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 is a new service that is based on the philosophy that home-based care provides the best environment for early childhood development and learning.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Governance and management: Company managers have established a range of high quality, comprehensive, systems and procedures to guide all aspects of service operations. These include:</p><ul>
<li>systems for effective communication between the education manager, programme manager, au pairs and families;</li>
<li>careful selection, placement and induction of au pairs;</li>
<li>clearly documented personnel management policies and procedures; and</li>
<li>well-developed self-review and quality assurance practices.</li>
</ul><p>Professional leadership: The programme manager provides effective professional and educational leadership for the service. She successfully:</p><ul>
<li>maintains warm, respectful and affirming relationships with au pairs, children and their families;</li>
<li>supports au pairs through regular visits, provision of resources, assistance with planning and regular professional development;</li>
<li>models appropriate learning interactions and conversations with children; and</li>
<li>maintains thorough and well documented communication with au pairs and families.</li>
</ul><p>Learning programme: The service promotes a balanced, stimulating learning programme for children. Au pairs are supported and encouraged to provide a variety of learning experiences in areas such as literacy, numeracy, creative and messy play. The programme is enriched by outings, excursions and use of community facilities. A feature of the programme is the opportunities for children to gain an awareness of other cultures through their relationships with au pairs.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation: The programme manager facilitates the implementation of a well developed process for the assessment, planning and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning. This process includes monthly learning goals that are derived from observations of children&rsquo;s interests by au pairs with opportunities for involvement of parents. Au pairs are supported to maintain well-presented portfolios that provide a record of children&rsquo;s learning and play.</p><h3>Agreed Priorities</h3><p>ERO and the service agree that priorities for review and development are to:</p><ul>
<li>further support au pairs to encourage children to initiate their own learning and foster creativity; and</li>
<li>continue to improve the quality and consistency of observations in portfolios that document noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Findings</h3><p>Although there are no M&#257;ori children currently enrolled in this service, well-developed procedures are in place that would enable the service to welcome and respond to M&#257;ori children. These include strategies for engaging and communicating with families about their values, expectations and aspirations for children. In addition the service is currently conducting a review to ensure that learning programmes reflect aspects of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s investigations did not identify any areas of concern.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>19 August 2011</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><p>19 August 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-au-pair-link-bay-of-plenty-1" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Au Pair Link, Bay of Plenty 1.</p><p>Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 is a home-based care service that provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age across the Bay of Plenty. There is currently a roll of sixteen children, all of whom are New Zealand P&#257;keh&#257;/European.</p><p>The service is owned by Au Pair Link Limited which maintains a number of home-based care licences across the country. Au Pair Link Bay of Plenty 1 began operating in 2009 and this is the first ERO review of the service.</p><p>The service recruits au pairs from overseas and facilitates their placement in children&rsquo;s homes, where they live in. Au pairs provide care and education for children, supported by a programme manager who is a qualified early childhood teacher.</p><p>The programme manager provides effective personal and professional support for au pairs, children and their families. Well-informed guidance and educational leadership is provided by a national education manager who is also a qualified and experienced early childhood teacher.</p><p>Particular strengths of the service identified in this review are:</p><p>comprehensive, well documented, high quality management systems and procedures to guide all aspects of service operations, including health and safety;</p><p>positive, affirming relationships and effective communication between the programme manager, au pairs, children and their families; and</p><p>strong support by the programme manager in assisting au pairs to provide a balanced, stimulating learning programme for children.</p><p>ERO and the service agree that priorities for further review and development are about supporting children to initiate their own learning and play and the quality of observations of learning recorded in portfolios.</p><p>In a relatively short period of time, a sound basis for the service has been established. Commitment to self review, reflective practice and continual improvement, mean that the service is well placed to sustain ongoing development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
