</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Au Pair Link BOP 1 is one of three networks in the central North Island, operated by the national early childhood organisation Au Pair Link. There are 14 licensed networks across New Zealand. In 2015 Au Pair Link changed ownership to the Evolve Company.</p><p>The organisation recruits au pairs (educators) from overseas to work with young children in their home, usually for a maximum term of one year. Through the recruitment process, families choose an educator who they think will meet the needs of their children. Building strong, secure relationships between families and educators is a high priority for the organisation.</p><p>This network is licensed for 80 children, including 80 aged up to two years. The roll at the time of the review was 12.</p><p>The programme manager is a fully qualified and registered teacher. She supports educators to provide high quality education and care for children.</p><p>Au Pair Link has responded positively to the areas for development and review identified in the August 2011 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three in the Au Pair Link organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service values the importance of children learning through play. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, strongly underpins the service's curriculum.</p><p>Children regularly play alongside others at playgroups and planned or spontaneous outings. These provide positive learning opportunities for them and educators. Children's interests are well catered for. Playgroup planning successfully focuses on extending their experiences.</p><p>Educators participate in a comprehensive orientation and induction process. During their placement with families they are supported by the programme manager to develop an understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, children's learning dispositions and bicultural practices.¬†</p><p>Children's progress is captured and celebrated by educators in photographs and stories. The programme manager provides good support and purposeful resourcing for educators. This includes coaching and guidance to model ways to plan for and effectively extend children's learning. Parents' contribution to the programme is highly valued. Sound assessment practices show children's interests and progress in a range of contexts.</p><p>Many children in the service are infants and toddlers. The placement of educators is well considered and responsive to the needs of individual children and their families. The programme manager works positively alongside educators to provide a curriculum that effectively supports the youngest children.</p><p>Provision for children with additional learning needs is carefully considered. The programme manager effectively works with educators, families and external agencies to promote the participation and engagement of these children in the learning programme.</p><p>Well aligned, robust systems and processes contribute to improvement, sustainability, meeting accountabilities and promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Over time Au Pair Link has developed some good self-review processes. An agreed next step is to further deepen these processes and continue to refine the use of internal evaluation for improvement.</p><p>The 2016 revised appraisal process incorporates the Practising Teacher Criteria. Continuing to strengthen aspects of the process should further assist teachers and leaders to grow and extend their practice.</p><p>Au Pair Link has made good gains in increasing the number of MƒÅori children enrolled and developing a bicultural curriculum. This is supported through appropriate resources. The service is well positioned to consider what educational success for MƒÅori looks like in the context of Au Pair Link.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers are focused on improvement and should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the focus on MƒÅori children achieving educational success.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Au Pair Link BOP 1 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Au Pair Link BOP 1 will be in four years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>25 May 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
