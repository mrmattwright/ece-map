<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Dinsdale Playcentre is well placed to sustain and promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Dinsdale Playcentre is a parent cooperative early childhood service operating under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association (the association), and is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation. The playcentre is situated on an attractive and well-maintained site in the suburb of Dinsdale, Hamilton and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. Currently there are 40 children on the roll, including 11 children under two years of age. The service offers four sessions per week. In late 2010, the Ministry of Education relicensed the centre under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy promotes family involvement in children&rsquo;s learning and parent education. Since the 2010 ERO review, parents have responded positively to the identified area for improvement about extending parents as educators. They have engaged in whole-centre professional development to improve the programme, particularly in science, numeracy and literacy. Parents report that this focus has strengthened connections between sessions and resulted in improved learning interactions between parents and children. A high proportion of parents are now involved in course work, centre training and leadership. In addition, an experienced kai&#257;whina has worked with centre members to strengthen bicultural perspectives in the environment and programme. The centre has had a significant upgrade to the building and improved the covered outdoor area.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn alongside interested and caring adults who know them well. Centre members have established a supportive, family-like culture. This is promoting a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for children and adults. Babies and toddlers make choices from a suitable range of equipment and materials in a safe and secure environment. They are able to explore, experiment and sustain their interests. Older children work and play alongside younger children and provide them with ideas and models for learning. Experienced members model interactions with children that foster their confidence and independence. This is promoting a culture of learning as newer members develop their confidence as educators.</p><p>Routines are kept flexible to meet the needs of children. There are many opportunities for children to celebrate their success and develop social skills. Children have ready access to attractively presented, individual portfolios that document aspects of their learning and participation in the programme. A new initiative whereby children&rsquo;s interests and parent goals are displayed is contributing to increased knowledge and understanding of centre members about the programme. Regular meetings at the end of sessions provide an opportunity for members to reflect on the level of children&rsquo;s participation and to plan further experiences for children.</p><p>Consideration should now be given to strengthening assessment and planning by:</p><ul>
<li>linking children&rsquo;s identified strengths and interests with plans to add complexity to their learning</li>
<li>identifying learning and progress in relation to these plans at end-of-session evaluations</li>
<li>reflecting on and documenting children&rsquo;s progress and development in individual profile books.</li>
</ul><p>M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau experience positive and reciprocal relationships with children and adults in the centre. Some aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori are included in the programme in meaningful ways. Children and their parents have participated in p&#333;whiri, led by knowledgeable members, to welcome visitors to their centre. The association promotes success for M&#257;ori, as M&#257;ori, through training initiatives and Puriri o Whakamaru, a group that encourages and funds local and national leadership initiatives. Centre members should continue to develop and enrich bicultural perspectives through strategies that integrate M&#257;ori values meaningfully into the centre environment, programme and interactions, and reflect M&#257;ori ways of viewing the child.</p><p>Centre leaders have clear and shared roles and responsibilities. There is a planned process for succession to leadership roles. Useful processes are in place for annual planning, financial management and aspects of self review. These are contributing to increased parent participation and centre sustainability. The association is providing appropriate governance and support for the centre. An experienced centre support worker has been recently appointed. She regularly visits the centre and provides useful reports that identify centre strengths and documents next steps for development and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre development and improvement would be enhanced by members having a clearer understanding of strategic and long term planning.</p><p>ERO and playcentre leaders agree that priorities for review and development are to:</p><ul>
<li>make more effective use of Ministry of Education guiding documents to support the centre to meet regulatory requirements and strengthen self review</li>
<li>further explore <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> as a developmental curriculum</li>
<li>increase the explicit and meaningful integration of the language, culture and heritage of all centre members</li>
<li>improve the programme so that older children are able to sustain and extend their interests over time and to add challenge and complexity to their learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dinsdale Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
