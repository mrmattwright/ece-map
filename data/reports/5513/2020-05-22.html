</table><p>Bluff Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bluff Kindergarten offers education and care for 30 children aged two years to school age. The philosophy focuses on <span lang="mi">ako</span>, learning and teaching together.</p><p>This is one of 23 kindergartens within the Kindergartens South Association (KS). KS is managed by a board of governors and a general manager. The general manager works with a team of senior teachers whose role is to support head teachers and staff working within each kindergarten.</p><p>Since the June 2017 ERO report there have been a number of changes within the board of governors and across KS management and significant changes within the teaching team at the kindergarten.</p><p>The 2017 ERO report recommended the kindergarten include desired outcomes for children's learning in the philosophy, continue to develop planning assessment and evaluation and develop understanding and use of rigorous internal evaluation. KS also needed to further develop systems to develop and improve the kindergarten's operations and practices. The KS, general manager and kindergarten leaders have made very good progress towards addressing the recommendations in the 2017 ERO report.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of seven kindergartens within KS.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Bluff Kindergarten is effectively enabling positive outcomes for children. Warm, respectful relationships between children, teachers and families are highly evident. Leadership has established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Leaders and teachers advocate for children and provide inclusive early childhood education.</p><p>A rich, responsive curriculum closely aligned with <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em> -the early childhood curriculum, provides a stimulating learning environment. Integration of <span lang="mi">te ao MƒÅori</span> perspectives are evident throughout teaching and learning. Teachers plan using authentic contexts for learning and use children's interests to engage them in the programme. Recent initiatives include the use of a range of approaches for different assessment purposes to understand and support children's learning and development.</p><p>The kindergarten is continually strengthening partnerships with parents. Parent and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children are valued and considered in assessment and planning and evaluation processes and programmes. Leaders and teachers work in partnership with parents of children with diverse learning needs to improve and enhance their learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers take responsibility for learning about the languages, cultures and identities of all children attending and this supports all children to feel a sense of belonging within the kindergarten. Children have opportunities to use <span lang="mi">te reo and tikanga MƒÅori</span> in the daily programme. Leaders and teachers have strengthened connections with the wider community. This has helped children develop a greater understanding of the culture, history and natural environment of their local area.</p><p>Transitions into and beyond the centre are well managed. The centre provides a range of well-considered and thoughtfully resourced indoor and outdoor environments that meet the needs of children.</p><p>The kindergarten has developed effective working relationships with a number of outside agencies to assist with priority learners. Ongoing and focussed professional development has helped teachers develop a range of strategies to deal with social and emotional issues.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes are well used to inquire into kindergarten and teacher practice and result in improvements. The next step is to show how these positive changes have improved outcomes for children.</p><p>KS leaders provide effective support and mentoring for the head teacher and teachers within the kindergarten. KS continues to make significant progress in improving the systems and process for the effective governance and management of the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation confirms and kindergarten leaders and teachers agree that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>to refine and consolidate recent initiatives in relation to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>broaden the scope of internal evaluation to show the impact on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the KS board and managers are to further develop and implement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the KS strategic Intent and annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the services guiding document <em><span lang="mi">Te Kaupapa mo nga akonga tatou</span></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation processes and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bluff Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>22 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
