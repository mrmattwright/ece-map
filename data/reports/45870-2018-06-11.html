</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Heuheu St is situated in central Taup≈ç. It provides full-day and sessional education and care for children aged from two years to school age in a mixed-age setting. It is licensed for 50 children. The current roll of 65 includes 23 children of MƒÅori decent and children from a range of other backgrounds.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the governing organisation has changed its name from Kidicorp to BestStart Education and Care and has become a not-for-profit organisation. An area manager provides professional leadership and business management support for the centre. The centre manager is supported in her role by an assistant manager. There are three other qualified and registered teachers and a caregiver who work a range of hours.</p><p>The centre's vision is to be a centre of innovation with passionate kaiako working collaboratively to provide fun, equitable learning opportunities for their tamariki. The centre philosophy has five main areas of focus; biculturalism, relationships, environment, quality teaching and programme planning.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to the areas identified in the previous ERO review in 2014. It is an active member of the Taup≈ç Community of Learning|KƒÅhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The language, culture and identity for MƒÅori and other children from diverse backgrounds is strongly visible within the environment. Leaders and teachers have strengthened tikanga MƒÅori practice and developed links with local iwi, T≈´wharetoa. Teachers value and acknowledge skills that MƒÅori whƒÅnau bring to the centre and naturally integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into their practices. Children and their families have a strong sense of belonging in a calm and settled environment.</p><p>The curriculum is highly responsive and supports children‚Äôs emerging interests and needs. The framework for assessment of children's learning has recently been reviewed. They have strengthened their focus on individual planning for children. Children's learning goals are developed in consultation with whƒÅnau. The curriculum is enriched through trips into the local community and visitors to the centre. Leaders acknowledge there would be benefit in formalising their local curriculum to align to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Children benefit from rich learning opportunities.</p><p>Teachers use a wide range of effective strategies to support the extension of learning in a stimulating and well-resourced environment. There is strong integration of literacy, mathematical concepts and oral language into learning experiences. There are respectful, caring and trusting relationships between teachers and children. Children with additional learning needs are well included through individualised planning and support. Positive transitions support effective partnerships for learning with parents and local schools. Children are empowered to self-manage, direct their own learning, take risks and become confident, active learners.</p><p>Experienced leaders provide collaborative leadership through strong communication with teachers. They effectively build teacher capability through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular meetings and ongoing professional support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>utilising teachers' interests, skills and strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modelling best practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance management systems, including teachers' inquiries and induction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>active involvement in the local Community of Learning |KƒÅhui Ako and professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>High expectations for teaching and learning are contributing to equitable and positive outcomes for children.</p><p>These aspects of leadership, along with BestStart's comprehensive and highly effective systems and processes guide all centre operations. Centre priorities are well aligned to the overarching strategic plan, vision and goals. There is regular consultation with parents and staff. BestStart maintains a commitment to the wellbeing of children and staff through targeted programmes. Extensive opportunities for professional learning and development are provided and there is a strategic approach to growing leaders within the organisation. Effective internal evaluation focuses on improved practice and outcomes for children. Children benefit from high quality education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre continue to implement the assessment planning process focus on individualised learning pathways for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Heuheu St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Heuheu St will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>11 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <i><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Service</a>s</i><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
