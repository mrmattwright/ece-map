</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tirau Playcentre provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre operates under the umbrella of the East Waikato Playcentre Association (EWPA) and is licensed for 30 children, including up to 10 under two years. There are 26 children enrolled, including 3 Māori. Children can attend morning sessions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The playcentre employs one qualified supervisor for one session and has a suitably qualified parent for the second.</p><p>The centre aims for children to learn through holistic play in a safe and nurturing environment.</p><p>There has been significant roll growth since the last 2013 ERO review. The recently appointed president is well supported by the past president and committee. Parents are responsible for different areas of centre management.</p><p>There has been little progress since the previous ERO review in 2013 about strengthening goal setting for children, ensuring maintenance and repairs are kept up to date, and more support and guidance for the committee from the EWPA. Parents remain unable to attend Playcentre Training over Course 1 locally because there is no provider.</p><p>The NZPF is currently undergoing restructuring and this has implications for EWPA governance actions in the future.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the EWPA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, respectful relationships with all adults in the centre. The families know each other well and children have developed a strong sense of belonging. Trips into the local and wider community are a feature of the programme. Transitions to school are supported with termly visits to the local school and regular participation at school events. Parents are highly committed to involving the whole family and developing reciprocal relationships within their community. Positive social competency skills are encouraged enabling children to interact constructively and develop strong friendships with one another.</p><p>Children can choose to work independently or in small groups, supported by parents as their first teachers. Their emerging interests are spontaneously extended and the areas of play are complemented by parent-led topics and interests from home. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated in authentic contexts. Children benefit from learning through play with a high ratio of adult support.</p><p>Māori children are well supported with a bi-cultural curriculum. Te reo, tikanga and te Ao Māori are highly visible in the environment. Children have fun participating in waiata and poi action dance. They benefit from learning about natural features of the local area. All children’s languages, culture and identity are celebrated and included in the curriculum.</p><p>Hazards are not being identified by parents and actioned in a timely manner. Some of the resources and equipment are in need of replacement. To improve the quality of learning outcomes and to ensure safety, further consideration needs to be given to the development and maintenance of the outdoor area.</p><p>Learning stories include some links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, dispositions for learning, and relationships. Further local playcentre training and support materials for parents is required to build their capability to assess children's learning, extend interests, show progress and continuity of learning over time.</p><p>Parents need to capture learning and regularly document it. Children’s learning is documented in portfolios. This is currently undertaken by a very small number of members and there is a need for more parents to share this responsibility and contribute to children's learning records. Strengthened assessment and planning is required with a focus on teaching and learning and individual children's interests.</p><p>Spontaneous self review at monthly meetings is focussed on management and the environment. Parents have recently begun professional development to support them to gain a better understanding of internal evaluation systems linked to improving outcomes for children. Local ongoing and regular support and training in this area is required.</p><p>Although EWPA provide some useful policies and procedures, there is a need to ensure that leaders are using current policies as they are updated by the Association. The parents have been focussed on keeping the playcentre viable and now need support to plan and implement improvements for children's learning.</p><p>The Playcentre Federation is in a time of transition. Nevertheless, EWPA need to provide regular support to the centre to maintain recent growth and continue to build parent knowledge about children's learning and centre management. A centre philosophy is in place and given the changes in families and roll growth it is now an appropriate time to be formally reviewed. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is a need to implement or strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a review of the centre philosophy in consultation with all stakeholders to reflect the playcentre's current community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a greater number of parents need to participate in playcentre education to support them to be involved in assessment for their child’s learning. This should help strengthen planning focussed on children’s interests and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the EWPA supports the committee to develop and implement a plan to address the key next steps and outlined in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tirau Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to Tirau Playcentre. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Reporting and documentation of hazards and the addressing of these issues needs to be urgently addressed. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS12]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified two areas of non-compliance.</p><p>The EWPA must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the employed supervisors are regularly appraised by a suitably experienced and knowledgeable appraiser in order to affirm areas of good practice and identify areas for further development [<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checks and police vetting of supervisors are carried out every three years in order to meet the legal requirements for children’s safety and wellbeing. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7A; Vulnerable Children’s Act 2014]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tirau Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato / Bay of Plenty</p><p>11 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
