</table><p>Victory Square Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Victory Square Kindergarten is one of 19 kindergartens governed and managed by Nelson Tasman Kindergartens. All kindergartens share a common vision and values.</p><p>Children can attend Victory Square Kindergarten from two-years-old to school age for up to six hours a day during the four kindergarten terms. School holiday programmes operate at three kindergartens. Children enrolled at other kindergartens can also enrol in the school holiday programmes.</p><p>The association employs qualified early childhood teachers, teacher aides and an administrator in each kindergarten. Victory Square Kindergarten also has a whānau support worker.</p><p>Children attending this kindergarten come from a wide range of cultural backgrounds. Many of the families have come to New Zealand as refugees.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the kindergarten has had a number of changes of staff. The teachers have made some progress to meet the recommendations in the report. However, child assessment, programme planning and self view remain key next steps in this ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Nelson Tasman Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's home cultures are respected and valued. Teachers effectively work with parents to find out about their culture and the best ways to include the home culture in the programme. Wall displays and resources are representative of the children's cultures and the indepth knowledge the teachers have of them. Children willingly share their home culture and language and provide leadership to the teachers and other children.</p><p>Relationships are positive, caring and inclusive among children, their teachers and with other children. Children respect the opinions of others. They actively seek to include others in their play. Older children include younger children and support them in the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Transitions into the kindergarten and on to school are well managed to support children and their families. The kindergarten and the local primary school teachers work closely together. They have a good understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and its links to the New Zealand Curriculum. The school teachers value the ways that children learn at kindergarten and build on these within the school setting to ensure successful and smooth transitions for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers skilfully adapt the programme to meet the interests, needs and life experiences of the children. The environment is well presented to give children a wide choice of activities, and the time and space to develop their ideas, solve their own problems and work cooperatively. Two-year-old children are well supported by teachers and older children to be successful and competent learners.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to learn about nature, sustainability and enviroschool approaches. They take an active role in maintaining the environment, recycling, being involved in challenging physical activity and knowing about and growing vegetables and fruit.</p><p>Teachers are committed and well supported by the association to continue to increase their knowledge, confidence and use of te reo and tikanga Māori. Māori legends are regularly included in the programme and often relate to caring for the environment. Children willingly share their knowledge of Māori culture and confidently join in waiata and karakia.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team and share their interests and skills to benefit other team members and the children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders, teachers and ERO agree that the next key steps to improve teaching and learning include leaders and teachers establishing and implementing:</p><ul>
<li>clear expectations, systems and processes for self review, child assessment, programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>effective ways to ensure teachers meet the expectations for high quality self review, child assessment, programme planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens</h3><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens has a very strong commitment to te ao Māori (the Māori world) and ensuring their Senior Education Advisors (SEAs) and teachers are competent and confident in te reo and tikanga Māori. A kaiārahi Māori successfully works with each kindergarten to increase teachers’ knowledge and understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori to ensure Māori children succeed as Māori.</p><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens provides significant support for diverse learners and their families. Teachers in kindergartens with diverse learners receive considerable extra training and funding to ensure the needs of these children are well met.</p><p>Self review is thorough, well understood and effectively used at association level and in most kindergartens.</p><p>The CEO and SEAs provide strong professional support to the board and teachers. They work collaboratively and effectively use their skills to support the kindergartens and early childhood education in the wider community.</p><p>The skills and knowledge of the CEO and the SEAs are regularly sought by other kindergarten associations and early childhood services. Nelson Tasman Kindergartens is innovative in its approaches and regularly seeks opportunities to be involved in the wider educational and local communities to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens has a well understood vision and strategic and annual planning systems. There are close links between the association strategic plan, the kindergarten plans, self review, appraisal and professional development. The teachers and families are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the objectives of the association strategic plan and to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens leaders have identified and ERO agrees that the next key steps for the organisation include:</p><ul>
<li>embedding a number of recent Nelson Tasman Kindergartens initiatives. These include board operations, particularly the inclusion of Māori perspectives and concepts, staff appraisal and involvement in Communities of Learning</li>
<li>strengthening consistency of child assessment, programme planning and evaluation across the kindergartens</li>
<li>continuing to investigate the role of parent committees within the association structure</li>
<li>strengthening the induction programme for head teachers and teachers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Victory Square Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Victory Square Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>2 June 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
