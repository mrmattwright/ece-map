</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Ao Hou Community Childcare Centre is a well established centre in the Auckland suburb of Point England which provides education and care for children mostly from the local community. The centre can cater for up to 28 children each day, including five up to two years of age. It operates in a modified city council building on council land close to the local primary school. The centre provides mixed-age learning programmes.</p><p>Children and families using the centre come from a variety of cultural backgrounds, with a high percentage of MƒÅori and Pacific families/whƒÅnau. Teachers represent some of children‚Äôs cultures and are able to converse with them in their home languages.</p><p>The centre philosophy, co-constructed with staff, provides a picture for parents about the aims and aspirations for children‚Äôs time in the centre. It refers to teachers‚Äô focus on Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnerships and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre is an incorporated society and intends to operate with a governance committee. The centre has a positive reporting history from ERO and continues to build on identified strengths and areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive and supportive relationships with teachers. They are warmly welcomed at the start of their day, and immediately settle to play. The mixed-age grouping of children provides many opportunities for children to practise tuakana/teina relationships with younger children. The tone in the centre is harmonious and friendly.</p><p>Teachers provide a ‚Äòfree-flow‚Äô play programme that encourages children to make independent choices about where and how they want to play. Teachers support the programme well by providing a range of good quality equipment and resources. Children are confident and often spend long periods exploring and developing their play. A next step for teachers could be to place a focus on including children in decision-making about aspects of the programme.</p><p>A considerable strength of the centre is the way teachers draw on what they know of children‚Äôs home life as well as their interest in activities to develop reciprocal and meaningful conversations with children. This is a very positive way of helping children to develop useful skills when they transition on to school. The programme also includes a positive focus on mathematical language and opportunities for children‚Äôs learning about literacy, nature and science through play.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô care for infants is affectionate and cheerful. Infants and young toddlers are included in older children‚Äôs play and in meal and group times. Teachers might now consider ways of providing more play items that encourage these children‚Äôs exploration of everyday and natural items.</p><p>Teachers have a focus on building and sustaining partnerships with whƒÅnau. Their use of face-to-face meetings to discuss parents' aspirations for their children has had a very positive impact on whƒÅnau interest in the programme. Teachers display information in the playroom to inform whƒÅnau of activities during the week that may be linked to whƒÅnau aspirations.</p><p>Children benefit from the inclusion of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. WhƒÅnau also commented favourably about the extent of their children‚Äôs learning of te reo MƒÅori and their familiarity with protocols, such as karakia before food. Teachers support this aspect of the programme well, with books of legends, use of te reo MƒÅori and their clear understanding of how they wish to improve children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers have developed assessment and programme planning over time. New portfolios are being developed to record the decisions made by whƒÅnau about what they want for their children. Teachers make good use of photographs to demonstrate children‚Äôs activities and participation in the programme.</p><p>Teachers have identified transitions to school as a topic for self review this year. Children are carefully settled when they first join the centre and teachers hope that this smooth transition can also happen for children when they move on to school.</p><p>The governance committee for the centre has not successfully attracted new membership recently. Teachers are hoping that the new and stronger relationships they are forging with whƒÅnau may encourage an interested group of adults to fulfil the purpose and directions of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and teachers identified their next steps. ERO agrees that these are to continue to build on newly established processes and practices in the centre. These include:</p><ul>
<li>new assessment and planning processes</li>
<li>relationship building with whƒÅnau</li>
<li>their bicultural journey</li>
<li>strengthening self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Management should continue to seek membership of whƒÅnau on the governance committee for the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Ao Hou Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Ao Hou Community Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
