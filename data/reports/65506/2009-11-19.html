<a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Picton Community Early Learning Centre is a community-based early childhood facility offering care and education for children from birth to five years.&nbsp; It also provides after-school and holiday programmes for school-aged children.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Self review effectively informs strategic planning and programme development. &nbsp;The well-run parent committee sought advice and guidance and now have a clearer understanding of their role in strategic planning. &nbsp;Recent developments to enhance the environment for children include covering of decks to increase the space available in cold or inclement weather and providing safety matting in both swing areas.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Management continues to be committed to the employment of qualified, registered staff.&nbsp; Currently, there are five registered teachers and three staff are in training.&nbsp; Thirteen staff are participating in a course to deepen their understanding of Te Ao M&#257;ori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. &nbsp;In response to high staff turnover, exit interviews for staff were introduced in 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">The 2006 ERO report recommended that centre staff continue with scheduled professional development to gain greater familiarity with, and consistency in, the use of the narrative approach for planning and evaluating the programme.&nbsp; Progress has been made in this area.&nbsp; Staff changes and focused self review have resulted in further professional development to strengthen planning and more effectively capitalise on children&rsquo;s interests.&nbsp; There is a focus on assisting them explore, learn and develop an understanding of the world around them.&nbsp; The curriculum incorporates aspects of the importance of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The programme is a successful mixture of free play and structured time.&nbsp; The present focus in the over-two&rsquo;s, on building relationships with the natural environment and a knowledge of how children can influence it, is highly visible.&nbsp; The under-two&rsquo;s programme is focusing on caring and sharing.&nbsp; Materials in this well resourced centre are invitingly laid out for children to self-select according to their interest.&nbsp; These foster their physical, creative and dramatic play and promote early literacy and numeracy development.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s individual choices are respected and they happily engage in purposeful activities, often for sustained periods, either individually or in small groups.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Reciprocal relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau are actively encouraged. &nbsp;Drop-off and pick-up times are opportunities for friendly discussions that enhance home-centre relationships.&nbsp; Parents appreciate the care and consideration shown by staff.&nbsp; Attractively presented children&rsquo;s profiles provide valuable records of their child&rsquo;s learning and development over time.&nbsp; Regular newsletters and various displays keep parents well informed of current focus areas and events.</p>
<p class="ReportText">This review evaluates the quality of education provided for children with particular emphasis on the programme, interactions and learning environments.&nbsp; It also reports on provision for M&#257;ori children and aspects related to all children&rsquo;s health and safety.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<a id="3-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of Picton Community Early Learning Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPicton Community Early Learning Centre.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Management continues to be committed to the employment of qualified, registered staff.&nbsp; Of 19 employed, five are registered teachers and three others are in training.&nbsp; Half of the 12 regular staff work part-time.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The 2006 ERO review recommended that centre staff continue with planned professional development to gain greater familiarity with, and consistency in, the use of the narrative approach for programme planning and evaluation.&nbsp; Staff changes and focused self review has resulted in further professional development to strengthen the planning process.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">ERO evaluated the quality of education through: observing the programme in action; interviewing key personnel; speaking with children and some parents; and reading related documentation.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Self review is effectively used to evaluate practice and guide improvements. &nbsp;The 2008 focus on assessment resulted in staff gaining a greater understanding of narrative assessment, particularly making connections between stories about children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; To assist parents by clearly explaining the learning story process and the purpose of profile books, staff developed a brochure, included in the enrolment package and held an evening meeting.&nbsp; Staff also introduced parent-teacher interviews.&nbsp; Formal feedback indicates that parents valued the opportunities provided and centre management is considering holding these formal meetings twice yearly.</li>
<li>As a result of well targeted self review and subsequent professional development, staff in the over-two area are modifying programme planning.&nbsp; They are now more effectively capitalising on children&rsquo;s interests to assist them explore, learn and develop an understanding of the world around them using socio-cultural perspectives.&nbsp; The present focus on building relationships with the natural environment and knowledge of how children can influence it, is highly visible. &nbsp;The under two&rsquo;s are focusing on caring and sharing.&nbsp; The programme, which is a mixture of free play and structured time, effectively reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The learning environment is thoughtfully organised in two well-resourced spaces for the over and under two-year-olds.&nbsp; Each age group has ready access to their own outside areas through covered verandas with roll down plastic sides for use when it is wet or cold.&nbsp; Materials and activities that help promote early literacy and numeracy development, dramatic, creative and physical play are accessible for children to self-select according to their interests.&nbsp; The under-two room has specialised resources to encourage the increased development of children&rsquo;s physical skills.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Interactions between staff, children and parents are positive, warm and caring.&nbsp; Parents are welcomed when they arrive and many stay to help settle their children.&nbsp; They are later briefed on the day&rsquo;s events.&nbsp; Self-initiated sharing and cooperation is evident between children, some of whom show great persistence in focusing on activities for extended periods of time.&nbsp; Teachers communicate well with each other to ensure smooth transitions for children during sessions and when toddlers move through to the over-two&rsquo;s programme.</li>
<li>Attractively presented children&rsquo;s profiles provide valuable records of learning and development over time.&nbsp; Learning stories complemented by relevant photographs and artwork indicate emerging strengths, needs and interests.&nbsp; They include evaluation of progress and strategies to support next learning steps. &nbsp;Staff are increasingly using their knowledge of children&rsquo;s learning dispositions to guide and enhance this process.&nbsp; Parent input is encouraged and there are records of the child&rsquo;s voice and, in some cases, input from more than one teacher.</li>
<li>Committee members, along with management, acknowledge the importance of supporting staff to keep abreast of current teaching practice.&nbsp; Continuing professional development is generously funded and release time for staff to carry out their administrative duties is provided.&nbsp; A team approach is taken to centre improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for improvement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Centre staff have identified that some organisational practices are inhibiting continuity of teaching and learning.&nbsp; ERO agrees.&nbsp; For example, considering ways to be more flexible in the timing and use of sessions on the mat before meal times, may help to better manage the behaviour of some children and allow others to pursue particular activities for longer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A new appraisal process is being introduced for all teachers.&nbsp; However, past appraisal records for the head teacher and manager were not available.&nbsp; Although links between professional development and appraisal are clear, it is not yet obvious how annual individual performance goals are monitored year to year.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-areas-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Areas of National Interest</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports.&nbsp; This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>M&#257;ori Children</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children and focuses on the potential of M&#257;ori children to develop as competent and capable learners. There are currently 21 children enrolled and six staff who identify as M&auml;ori.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Policies and procedures have been reviewed to acknowledge the importance of tangata whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. &nbsp;The centre takes a whanaungatanga approach that acknowledges children are central to both wh&#257;nau and culture. Parents are encouraged to share information about their child&rsquo;s interests and significant events in their lives.&nbsp; Ways of seeking feedback on the aspirations and hopes of wh&#257;nau for their children have been strengthened with the recently introduced parent-teacher interviews. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Staff are participating in a course to deepen their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori.&nbsp; They model te reo M&#257;ori in documentation and are becoming more confident in using the language for greetings, counting, waiata, and days of the week in the daily programme.</li>
<li>Families are encouraged to include their whakapapa in their child&rsquo;s portfolio of learning.&nbsp; Some teachers are including learning stories and visual presentations that reflect aspects of learning meaningful to families of M&#257;ori children.&nbsp; Older children have recently benefited from a planned approach that focused on M&#257;oritanga and building relationships.&nbsp; Activities based around M&auml;t&auml;riki, toi M&auml;ori, ta moko and taonga allow M&auml;ori children to share important features of their lives with others at the centre and reinforce understanding of their cultural heritage.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area for improvement</h4>
<ul>
<li>ERO affirms centre management&rsquo;s decision to encourage and support all staff to use te reo M&auml;ori and more frequently integrate tikanga M&#257;ori into the daily programme.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the licensee and staff of Picton Community Early Learning Centre completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="6-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Recommendations</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO and the centre management agreed that:</p>
<p class="Recommendation" style="padding-left: 30px;">6.1 The head teacher, supported by the management team, will continue to use outside agencies to assist staff better meet the needs of individuals and groups of children.</p>
<p class="Recommendation" style="padding-left: 30px;">6.2 Management will ensure that performance management cycles are fully implemented for all staff.</p>
<a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.&nbsp;</p>

The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li>Areas of National Interest &ndash; information about how Government policies are working in early childhood centres.</li>
<li>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.&nbsp;</p></html>
