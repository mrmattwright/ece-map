</table><p>Tadpoles Early Childhood Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tadpoles Early Childhood Centre is a new purpose-built centre in Mangere. It is licensed to provide care and education for 75 children, including up to 24 under two years of age. Children learn in three separate rooms specifically organised to meet the needs of the age groups. Each room has its own outdoor learning environment. The children have easy access to garden and bush areas on Mangere Mountain and other local educational settings.</p><p>The Tadpoles community is culturally and socio-economically diverse. The majority of the children are MƒÅori or PƒÅkehƒÅ. Pacific, Asian and other ethnicities complete the roll. Relationships, community, environment, and learning and care are at the heart of the centre philosophy. These aspects are further influenced by teachers' aspirations to grow independent children who are resilient, resourceful and reflective learners.</p><p>The centre manager and assistant centre manager lead a large teaching team of 13 qualified teachers supported by a cook, an office administrator and several unqualified staff.</p><p>This is the centre's first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly greeted by teachers on arrival each morning. While parents and teachers share stories, children move off and settle into their start-of-day activities. Friendships are rekindled, and overnight experiences talked about as they venture on to new challenges.</p><p>Children know centre routines well. They freely choose to play indoors or outdoors and initiate their own play and learning, often in friendly groups. They form relationships with other children while being cared for by attentive teachers. Teachers support them in exploring aspects of literacy and numeracy, and for some older children, in learning about science and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Children under two play confidently and with enthusiasm. A high staff-to-child ratio provides good support for their play, learning and care. Teachers are patient and talk gently to children about their play and learning. Self-help is strongly promoted through the programme and centre routines. Babies and toddlers particularly benefit from the consistency of staff and the nurturing, individualised and gentle care that is sensitive to their preferences.</p><p>Children are provided with a wide variety of resources in all learning areas. There are spaces for children to develop and use their artistic, physical and social skills. They are well supported by teachers to see themselves as capable and confident learners. Children show initiative and engagement in leading their own uninterrupted learning for sustained periods. Natural and open-ended resources promote children's creativity and exploration learning opportunities.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are committed to growing the team‚Äôs bicultural knowledge. Waiata, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are formally incorporated into daily programmes. Increasing the integration of these into the informal parts of the programme is a next step for leaders and teachers. Strengthening bicultural practice will continue to grow as understanding deepens.</p><p>Portfolios record children's learning, and celebrate each child as a member of their family and the wider centre whƒÅnau. Relevant links are made between children's learning and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are well placed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue extending children's access to the local community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intentionally plan for improvement in outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include parents' and children's opinions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre benefits from strong leadership. Leaders have established sound systems for monitoring and promoting centre improvement. These systems and processes contribute to the teaching team‚Äôs internal evaluation. They include teacher appraisal that is personalised for each teacher, aligns with the centre‚Äôs strategic direction, and improves individual and collective teacher professional practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the alignment between the philosophy, strategic, and annual plans with statements of intent to further guide the centre's direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring the centre's guiding documents fully reflect the teaching approaches and valued outcomes of the learning programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to underpin teachers' reflections on their practices and all phases of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tadpoles Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tadpoles Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>31 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
