<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Strathmore Park Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed on arrival. Parents appreciate the multicultural nature of the service and the positive impact it has on children&rsquo;s understandings of others. Interactions between teachers and children are caring and positive. Children are friendly, confident to approach adults to make requests and share achievements. Teachers support children to negotiate relationships and promote their confidence and well-being.</p><p>The programme provides opportunities for children to investigate and explore through making their own play choices. Teachers value and support children&rsquo;s contribution to the programme and are responsive to their interests. Educators use a range of effective teaching strategies to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Good quality group planning is appropriately based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and <em>Kei Tua o te</em> <em>Pae Assessment for Learning: Early Childhood Exemplars</em>. Recognition of learning is sound and regularly evaluated in team meetings. Teachers discuss and document children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths, and identify specific strategies to support individual and group needs.</p><p>The kindergarten is well-resourced, with a good variety of learning spaces. Literacy and mathematical development is promoted. Children&rsquo;s awareness of caring for the environment is fostered through gardening, composting and recycling. The outdoors promotes physical development and play and plans to further develop the space are underway.</p><p>The teaching team is aware that its next step is to continue to implement robust self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Strathmore Park Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atStrathmore Park Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the May 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has restructured, increased session hours and expanded the teaching team. This has improved teacher to child ratios. Educators include a head teacher and three teachers, one of whom is provisionally registered.</p><p>Physical changes have been made to the indoor environment to improve working and storage spaces. Developments are underway for considerable change to the outdoor areas.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Programme</p><p>The programme provides opportunities for children to investigate and explore through making their own play choices. Teachers value and support children&rsquo;s contribution to the programme and are responsive to their interests. Educators use a range of effective teaching strategies to support learning. Questions promote and extend play. Teachers encourage children to lead learning. Educators work alongside children using thoughtful prompts to build confidence and to support emerging and developing literacy and mathematical skills. They model oral language and discuss words and meaning to build children&rsquo;s vocabulary.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives are evident in the programme. Many children share their mihi and confidently take part in waiata and action songs.</p><p>Planning</p><p>Good quality group planning is appropriately based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, and <em>Kei Tua o te</em> <em>Pae Assessment for Learning: Early Childhood Exemplars.</em> Recognition of learning is sound and regularly evaluated. At team meetings educators discuss and document children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths. They identify specific strategies to support groups and individual needs.</p><p>Assessment</p><p>Learning journals record children&rsquo;s involvement in the kindergarten programme. Cultural perspectives are included in relevant learning stories.</p><p>Teachers are currently reviewing the extent to which children&rsquo;s voices and self assessments are incorporated in learning journals.</p><p>Environment</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed on arrival. Parents appreciate the inclusive and multicultural nature of the service and the positive impact it has on children&rsquo;s understandings of others.</p><p>The kindergarten is well-resourced, with a good variety of learning spaces. Literacy and mathematical development is promoted. The outside environment promotes physical development and play. Children&rsquo;s awareness of caring for the environment is fostered through gardening, composting and recycling.</p><p>Interactions</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are caring and positive. Children are friendly, confident to approach adults to make requests and share achievements. Teachers support children to negotiate relationships and promote their confidence and wellbeing.</p><p>Self review A sound framework is used to guide self review. Support from the senior teacher is strengthening this process. When revisiting their philosophy teachers focused on their bicultural practices. They developed a clear statement which has been shared with the parent community.</p><p>Transition</p><p>The teaching team has worked hard to develop relationships with local schools. Transition to school is celebrated through wall displays that provide useful information for children and wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Te reo M&#257;ori is used effectively at mat times. Teachers are working on purposefully integrating its use throughout the day, to better reflect the team&rsquo;s support for biculturalism.</p><p>Positive guidance procedures cater appropriately for children&rsquo;s emotional development and could usefully be reviewed to include strategies that promote children&rsquo;s self management.</p><p>The team and ERO agree that work on strengthening continuity in documenting and showing how they are extending children&rsquo;s learning is an area for development.</p><p>Broadening the scope of self review is an identified next step. Planned self review needs to gather momentum. Spontaneous review should occur as appropriate.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The previous ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through <em>Te&nbsp;Manawa</em></li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Strathmore Park Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that all emergency drills are appropriately recorded</li>
<li>ensure that all staff are appraised annually.</li>

</table><p>7 August 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-strathmore-park-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Strathmore Park Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Strathmore Park Kindergarten.</p><p>Strathmore Park Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed on arrival. Parents appreciate the multicultural nature of the service and the positive impact it has on children&rsquo;s understandings of others. Interactions between teachers and children are caring and positive. Children are friendly, confident to approach adults to make requests and share achievements. Teachers support children to negotiate relationships and promote their confidence and well-being.</p><p>The programme provides opportunities for children to investigate and explore through making their own play choices. Teachers value and support children&rsquo;s contribution to the programme and are responsive to their interests. Educators use a range of effective teaching strategies to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Good quality group planning is appropriately based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and <em>Kei Tua o te</em> <em>Pae Assessment for Learning: Early Childhood Exemplars</em>. Recognition of learning is sound and regularly evaluated in team meetings. Teachers discuss and document children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths, and identify specific strategies to support individual and group needs.</p><p>The kindergarten is well-resourced, with a good variety of learning spaces. Literacy and mathematical development is promoted. Children&rsquo;s awareness of caring for the environment is fostered through gardening, composting and recycling. The outdoors promotes physical development and play and plans to further develop the space are underway.</p><p>The teaching team is aware that its next step is to continue to implement robust self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
