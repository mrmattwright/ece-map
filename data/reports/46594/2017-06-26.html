</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Growing Learners provides education and care services for up to 25 children, between the ages of three months and five years. Children are from Pacific, Māori and Indian cultural backgrounds, with the largest group being Samoan.</p><p>The centre opened in December 2014 and this is its first ERO review. One of the two centre directors/owners is a fully registered teacher. She manages staff, leads the teaching team and administers systems to support daily centre operations. The other owner manages property matters.</p><p>Three staff have provisional teaching certificates and a fourth is currently working towards provisionally certification.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engage well in the inclusive programme. A number of children have other family members attending the centre and there are natural tuakana/teina relationships. Children explore the learning environment, and play contentedly alongside each other. The teachers support children's individual and group interests through programme planning. Many children are confident, articulate, independent, and curious learners.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for and are fully integrated into the mixed-age learning environment. Teachers interact with them during routines and play experiences according to their individual developmental stages. Language development is prioritised to help these younger children communicate with others. A core group of teachers fosters infants' and toddlers' emotional wellbeing through being consistently responsible for and available to them.</p><p>Strong relationships are developing between teachers and parents. Teachers have begun to gather parents' ideas about what they want for their children through surveys and daily conversations. Parents' suggestions and requests are used to plan programmes for children.</p><p>Excursions enable parents, children and teachers to enjoy new experiences and explore learning opportunities together. Parents appreciate the warm, friendly conversations that they have with teachers about their children's progress. Children's home languages and cultural identities are affirmed through centre programmes, celebrations and events.</p><p>The teaching director is committed to growing leadership in the team and models effective teaching practices. The director is initiating a professional network of leaders from local centres.</p><p>Organisational structures would be improved by linking the centre philosophy to quality practice indicators and more clearly linking health and safety policies to procedures. Appraisal is at the beginning stages of development and should be improved to meet the requirements of the Education Council. It would be worthwhile to establish longer term strategic planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening teacher appraisal systems and mentoring programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the centre director is appraised regularly by an external appraiser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating strategic goals to show improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to evaluate and improve centre policies and associated procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that programme planning responds to children's learning dispositions and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing partnerships with parents that have a focus on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Growing Learners Childcare &amp; Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Growing Learners Childcare &amp; Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>26 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
