<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Waikanae Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>A recent initiative is Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s Criteria for Curriculum Implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high-quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p>A recently appointed head teacher has focused on building a collaborative and cohesive teaching team, after a period of staff change. A positive, harmonious tone is evident. Regular communication and shared understandings of expectations promote a mutually supportive community. Involving parents and wh&#257;nau in learning partnerships is an ongoing priority.</p><p>The programme strongly reflects the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and is responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. It provides opportunities for children to engage in rich exploratory, social and imaginative play. An attractive and stimulating learning environment invites and sustains children&rsquo;s curiosity. Wall displays and learning stories affirm children&rsquo;s identities, interests and achievements. Information for parents is clearly communicated and attractively presented.</p><p>Children collaborate productively in their play and interact in supportive and meaningful ways. Teachers focus on the holistic needs and development of children. They support and affirm children to play well as good friends and to make appropriate choices in their developing relationships.</p><p>Enhancing aspects of the programme, and strengthening planning and self review processes should promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Waikanae Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWaikanae Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The May 2008 ERO review identified that the kindergarten provided a high quality learning environment for children. Teachers were responsive, inclusive and reflective. Areas for improvement included aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation and teachers gaining an in-depth understanding of self review.</p><p>A recently appointed head teacher has focused on building a collaborative and cohesive teaching team within the kindergarten, after a period of staff change.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Programme</p><p>The development of children&rsquo;s social competence underpins the programme. Children are busy and engaged in their play, working collaboratively and cooperatively. They choose from a wide variety of interesting learning activities, which stimulate and develop their emerging interests. Well-established and clearly understood routines provide a structure to the day. Children&rsquo;s needs are recognised, monitored and appropriately addressed. Practices to promote inclusion for all children are well supported.</p><p>An ongoing emphasis on involving parents and wh&#257;nau in learning partnerships is evident. Developing connections to the local environment, the marae and M&#257;ori community enriches learning.</p><p>Environment</p><p>An attractive and interesting environment invites children to engage in a wide range of exploratory, social and imaginative play. They confidently access and organise resources for their learning, and show a sense of belonging. Care for the natural environment is fostered through the tending of the extensive edible gardens. These provide ongoing opportunities for investigation and sustained learning.</p><p>Wall displays and learning stories affirm children&rsquo;s identities, interests and achievements. Children are encouraged to regularly revisit and enrich their learning experiences through portfolios, and interactive and photographic displays. A bicultural perspective is reflected in the environment and the use of natural materials is promoted. Information for parents is clearly communicated and attractively presented.</p><p>Interactions</p><p>Warm, welcoming and caring interactions are evident in teachers&rsquo; conversations with children and their families. Teachers respond to children&rsquo;s communication with curiosity and interest. Rich, descriptive language is used to support children&rsquo;s expanding vocabulary and build conceptual understandings. Ongoing communication between teachers focuses on children&rsquo;s well-being and learning.</p><p>Children interact in rich, supportive and meaningful ways. Positive interpersonal relationships are fostered. Strategies to promote friendship and cooperation are explicitly shared and developed with children.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation</p><p>Teachers work to develop a shared understanding of children&rsquo;s interests and progress. They regularly discuss children&rsquo;s well-being, successes and involvement in the programme. Planning stories provide useful records of learning. They promote reflection on the programme and outcomes for children, and identify possible new directions for learning.</p><p>Planning walls effectively communicate key ideas and developments in focus areas to children and their families. Portfolios provide a portrait of the child as a learner and show learning over time. These promote and give value to contributions from children and their families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Routines and transition times do not consistently provide opportunities for rich interaction or fully support children&rsquo;s developing independence. Reviewing aspects of the programme in greater depth to explore ways to more effectively promote children&rsquo;s developing strengths, independence and leadership should strengthen practice.</p><p>Staff continue to develop their planning and evaluation practices. Further refining of processes should enable teachers to respond more effectively to assessment information through the planned programme.</p><p>Staff acknowledge self review is in the early stages of development. Establishing shared in-depth understanding and practice of self-review should strengthen decision-making and enhance outcomes for children.</p><h3>Other Priorities</h3><h4>Association Support</h4><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Productive partnerships are established and maintained with support agencies, wh&#257;nau and kindergarten staff to provide education and care for children with moderate to severe learning needs. Parents&rsquo; knowledge of the child, their aspirations and perspectives are sought and valued. Conversation about children&rsquo;s specific needs is open and ongoing.</p><p>Transition into and from the centre is tailored to the individual&rsquo;s needs. Personalised books constructed to identify key people, routines and aspects of the environment, provide support for wh&#257;nau. These help to ease a child&rsquo;s transition into the kindergarten environment. Good connections with local schools are established and information is shared to enhance the transition process.</p><p>Teachers promote a range of inclusive practices and equip the children with specific strategies for communicating and playing productively. Planning clearly identifies goals and planned actions, which are well monitored. Individual books are developed to celebrate the child&rsquo;s strengths and interests, and are shared with peers.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Waikanae Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist.

</table><p>2 March 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-waikanae-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Waikanae Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Waikanae Kindergarten.</p><p>Waikanae Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>A recent initiative is Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s Criteria for Curriculum Implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high-quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p>A recently appointed head teacher has focused on building a collaborative and cohesive teaching team, after a period of staff change. A positive, harmonious tone is evident. Regular communication and shared understandings of expectations promote a mutually supportive community. Involving parents and wh&#257;nau in learning partnerships is an ongoing priority.</p><p>The programme strongly reflects the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and is responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. It provides opportunities for children to engage in rich exploratory, social and imaginative play. An attractive and stimulating learning environment invites and sustains children&rsquo;s curiosity. Wall displays and learning stories affirm children&rsquo;s identities, interests and achievements. Information for parents is clearly communicated and attractively presented.</p><p>Children collaborate productively in their play and interact in supportive and meaningful ways. Teachers focus on the holistic needs and development of children. They support and affirm children to play well as good friends and to make appropriate choices in their developing relationships.</p><p>Enhancing aspects of the programme, and strengthening planning and self review processes should promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
