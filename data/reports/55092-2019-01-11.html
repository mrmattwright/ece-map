</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dot Kids Early Learning Centre Greenmeadows Nursery is located in Greenmeadows, Napier. The service provides all-day education and care for up to 28 children, including up to 25 infants and toddlers. At the time of this review, 18 Māori children attended.</p><p>The service philosophy principles emphasise kāwanatanga, tino rangatiratanga, whānau tangata, whakamana, oritetanga and kotahitanga. The outdoor learning space has been redeveloped to extend the physical learning opportunities provided for children. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>Since the December 2015 ERO report, the centre has experienced some changes to the teaching team. This includes an appointment of a new centre manager.</p><p>Dot Kids Nursery, previously known as Little Guppies ECLC Nursery, was purchased by Provincial Education Group Limited (the organisation) in May 2017. They provide governance and management support. A substantial management team oversees a number of services nation wide. This includes a professional leader who provides support and guidance to centre staff. Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the organisation's philosophy and practices.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas for improvement for the service. These included: strengthening teacher knowledge of culturally responsive practice; building a shared understanding of effective assessment; and self review. Progress in these areas is ongoing.</p><p>This review was one of seven services in Provincial Education Group Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based curriculum that is strongly focused on the special characteristics of infants and toddlers. There are many opportunities for children to explore with their senses and challenge their developing physical skills. The outdoor environment encourages opportunities for exploration that is meaningful and enjoyable for children.</p><p>Teachers know children well and work alongside them, using rich oral language to support and extend their learning opportunities. They sensitively respond to children's need for secure attachments. Teaching practice is respectful and children access a calm and unhurried curriculum.</p><p>Leaders have identified that continuing to build bicultural practice is a next step. As part of this process consideration should be given to weaving a place-based curriculum that promotes and celebrates te ao Māori and places of significance that are unique to the centre.</p><p>The organisation has recently developed a systematic framework to support teachers to review their philosophy and develop clear indicators of practice, to promote a shared understanding of the valued outcomes for children. As part of this process planned consultation will occur with parents and whānau to determine what educational success looks like for them and their children.</p><p>A next step is to strengthen teachers' practice to better support children and their families of Pacific heritage. The recently introduced <em>Tapasā Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners</em> should help to guide practice.</p><p>Group planning is based on children’s emerging interests and extends the curriculum offered. Clearly identifying the learning outcomes expected should assist in deepening planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Profiles show rich detail about children’s interests, these are well analysed and teachers plan appropriately to build on the learning opportunities provided. Children’s learning is regularly shared with parents. Leaders acknowledge that a next step is to better reflect parent aspirations and establish shared learning outcomes for children. In addition, children’s culture, language and identity should be more strongly reflected through these documents.</p><p>A responsive approach is in place to support children and parents as they transition into the centre and onto the organisation's preschool.</p><p>A recent parent survey has affirmed teacher practice and provided feedback for ongoing consideration. Leaders have been pro-active in responding to the survey’s findings.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. They use systematic self review to improve the quality of education and care for children. Leaders should continue to build teachers' capability to evaluate the impact of the curriculum and teacher practice on outcomes for children.</p><p>The appraisal process provides a sound framework for teachers to reflect on and improve their practice. Further consideration should be given to the setting of specific, measurable and aspirational goals for teachers. Recent professional learning and development has built teachers' knowledge of effective appraisal and using the teaching standards. The organisation is providing guidance for teachers in meeting these expectations.</p><p>The organisation's senior leadership team has high expectations for teacher practice. Systems and processes are in place to promote improvements, for the benefit of children and whānau. Teachers are encouraged to grow their understanding. Distributed leadership is promoted and teachers have opportunities to share their individual strengths.</p><p>A formal reporting process is now being implemented which provides feedback to teachers about the focus of professional leaders' visits.</p><p>A recent national initiative led by the organisation provides opportunities for parents and whānau to contribute to the valued outcomes of the service. The organisation should draw from these national findings to inform their strategic direction.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop the bicultural programme and deepen their understanding of culturally responsive practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build internal evaluation capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the organisation agree that to further strengthen practice, their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>monitor the progression of strategic goals, through measurement of improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use formal internal evaluation processes at senior leadership level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effectively use the findings of the national philosophy review to inform the organisation’s strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of DOT KIDS EARLY LEARNING CENTRE GREENMEADOWS NURSERY completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of DOT KIDS EARLY LEARNING CENTRE GREENMEADOWS NURSERY will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>11 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
