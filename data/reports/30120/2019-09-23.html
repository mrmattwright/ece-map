</table><p>BestStart Montessori Flagstaff¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Montessori Flagstaff is located in Hamilton and is licensed to provide all-day education and care for children up to six years of age. The centre operates two aged-based rooms with separate outdoor spaces. At the time of this ERO review 49 children were enrolled, including seven of MƒÅori descent and children from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. The teaching team consists of qualified and unqualified teachers. Teachers' diversity of cultural backgrounds reflects that of children and families in the centre.</p><p>The service aims to weave principles of Montessori and the strands of the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> The vision of BestStart Montessori is to foster independence, resilience and self-confidence through an environment providing children with a sense of belonging. They aim to support children's wellbeing and development.</p><p>Since ERO's October 2014 evaluation, BestStart Montessori Flagstaff have strengthened their response to fully integrate and reflect the Montessori philosophy in the outdoor environment.</p><p>The service is operated by BestStart, a charitable organisation owned by the Wright Family Foundation. Since the last ERO review of this centre a new chief executive officer has been appointed. Regional and local professional service and business managers oversee the central North Island BestStart centres. Their vision is to work in partnership with families, whƒÅnau, teachers and communities to enable children to achieve their learning potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 15 reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families experience a strong sense of belonging in the centre. The curriculum allows children to choose, self-extend and follow their own interests and to support their social competencies. Children benefit from a broad, rich curriculum, with particular strengths in literacy, mathematics and science. Learning areas are well presented, easily accessed and align with the Montessori philosophy. Independence, perseverance and self-confidence are integral to the programme, building children's respect for others and the environment. Responsive and caring interactions between teachers and children contribute to a calm, settled and focused learning environment.</p><p>Teachers have a deep understanding of each child as a unique learner. The curriculum incorporates visits to the wider community and regular celebrations that allow whƒÅnau and families to share in children‚Äôs culture and learning. Parents are well informed about their children's learning and centre activities through a variety of ways. Teachers are highly responsive to children with diverse needs and implement appropriate strategies to engage them in learning. Children under two years of age benefit from respectful and caring relationships with teachers. These young children are well engaged and are able to make choices about their learning and play. Teachers are practicing the use of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori. Teaching practices strongly support children's independence and care.</p><p>Leaders nurture a culture of respect and trust. The BestStart professional services manager has a working knowledge of the Montessori philosophy and along with the business manager provides effective professional support and guidance for the centre manager. Highly professional leadership is provided by the experienced and knowledgeable centre manager who is well respected and demonstrates an open management style. She works in a coaching and mentoring role with teachers to promote a shared leadership approach. The centre's vision and goals are firmly focused on learning and equitable outcomes for children. Strong leadership is supporting positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Systems and processes guide centre operation. Internal evaluation is improvement focused and includes ongoing consultation with families and whƒÅnau. There is clear alignment between the regional strategic direction and centre annual plans. The appraisal process supports teachers to inquire into strengthening their practice, supported by regular and ongoing coaching and mentoring. Several initiatives to remove barriers to education and support wellness for children promotes equity for all learners. The organisations philosophy, vision and goals promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for leaders and teachers is to strengthen the assessment, planning and evaluation process. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>capturing and documenting how children contribute to their own assessment of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that children can access their portfolio to enable them to revisit their individual learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An area for review and development is to continue to strengthen bicultural practises, relating to language and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Montessori Flagstaff completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>23 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
