</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Massey Childcare Centre Inc is situated on the Massey University, Turitea campus in Palmerston¬†North. It caters for children of university staff and students, with some places available for the wider community. All four sections of the service, Hoiho and Tui (infants and toddlers), Kea and Kiwi (young children) share the interlinked premises. The sections are separately licensed services that are jointly managed.</p><p>Since the July 2013 ERO report, there have been a number of changes in management. Two curriculum leaders have been appointed to guide professional practice for each of the parallel age grouped areas. The new centre manager oversees human resources, leadership, financial and operational practices.</p><p>The centre is governed by a management committee of elected parents, a university representative, the centre manager and the curriculum leaders.</p><p>Kea Section is licensed for 40 children over two years of age. Of the total roll of 44, seven children identify as MƒÅori and five as of Pacific heritage. Staff form a parallel team with those in the Kiwi section.</p><p>Practice is underpinned by the service's Community of Researchers (COR) programme. It emphasises the importance of secure attachments and collaborative relations between the child, parents/whanau and teachers and an environment that promotes children's active participation, confidence and creativity.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of four reviews of education and care services operating under Massey Childcare Centre Inc.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, responsive interactions with highly respectful teachers. The environment is thoughtfully resourced to support children‚Äôs interests, curiosity and exploration. Aspects of the natural environment (including sustainability) are prominent. Teachers effectively support children‚Äôs literacy, mathematical, scientific, and artistic learning, and their physical development in the context of play.</p><p>Teachers purposefully establish warm, whƒÅnau-like relationships with children and their families. They use effective, respectful strategies to support children‚Äôs growing social and emotional competence and engage in meaningful conversations that promote their sense of themselves as confident, capable learners. Oral language development is well supported. The physical surroundings celebrate children‚Äôs identities, learning and contributions.</p><p>Portfolios provide a useful account for parents, of children‚Äôs engagement in the programme, learning dispositions, knowledge and development. Teachers weave current teaching theory into documented observations, skilfully identifying children‚Äôs significant learning and progress. Children‚Äôs voice and teaching interactions are authentically documented. Useful links are made between children‚Äôs interests and the group COR programme.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge, and ERO's evaluation affirms, that the quality of narrative assessment practice needs further development. Documentation requires strengthening to clearly and consistently show how a cycle of formative assessment, planning and evaluation is used to enhance children's learning. It should also more consistently show ways in which teachers regularly consider individual cultural contexts, and parents‚Äô aspirations for their children's learning, in order to enrich their teaching strategies and learning analysis.</p><p>The dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand is valued and well integrated in the curriculum. Portfolio documentation is inclusive of tamariki MƒÅori identity. The intentional building of relationships with whƒÅnau through kanohi-ki-te-kanohi interactions creates additional opportunities to share culture and knowledge to strengthen children‚Äôs identity and mana. Leaders have established a bicultural committee that successfully supports teachers to promote te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers demonstrate commitment to continual improvement of their bicultural programme and are growing their relationships with local iwi.</p><p>Cultural diversity is valued. Pacific aiga share their beliefs and customs as they contribute to the programme. Continuing to strengthen partnerships to support better understanding of Pacific cultures, languages and identities is identified by the centre as a next step.</p><p>Processes for transitioning children into the Kea section are very well considered and flexible to individual needs. Parents are closely involved and well informed about their children‚Äôs progress through the transition period. Children‚Äôs wellbeing and sense of belonging are supported at these times.</p><p>Teachers employ a range of useful strategies to prepare for children‚Äôs transitions to school. They purposefully promote peer relationships between those of similar ages in the Kea and Kiwi sections to support their confidence. Relevant information is shared with children, parents and schools and readiness for school is celebrated.</p><p>Internal evaluation requires strengthening. Teachers regularly collaborate on reviews to inform decisions about improvement. Leaders and teachers should ensure data analysis and subsequent decision making are systematic and robust, so that the impact of processes and practices on children's learning are more fully emphasised. The recent adoption of a revised internal evaluation process is likely to increase the focus on the impact of the curriculum on valued outcomes for children.</p><p>Teacher appraisals include useful, regular feedback from curriculum leaders. Structured inquiries encourage research and critical reflection and contribute to valuable exploration of new thinking. The current appraisal process does not meet Education Council expectations. The service is developing a new appraisal process that includes the recently developed <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession</em> and has the potential to more strongly support teacher improvement. The revised process should also include evidence of the impact of specific practices on MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Effective distributed leadership is in place. Leaders and teachers are collaborative, improvement focused and highly reflective. The Curriculum Leader, Section Manager and Team Leader provide effective educational leadership and whole-centre internal professional learning opportunities that build teacher capacity.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that priorities for promoting learning outcomes for children are strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documentation of assessment, planning and evaluation, particularly in relation to the impact of teaching strategies and effectiveness of response to children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to systematically monitor the impact of practices on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process to more strongly support teacher improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Massey Child Care Centre Inc - Kea Section completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Massey Child Care Centre Inc - Kea Section will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>29 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
