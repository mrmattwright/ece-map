</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Horizons Montessori Preschool provides full-day education and care for up to 30 children aged 2 years and over. The centre is located in the residential area of New Lynn close to two local primary schools. The premises have been modified to provide a spacious facility for early learning. Children have ready access to outdoor areas.</p><p>Horizons Montessori Preschool is a privately owned centre. The owners are both qualified early childhood teachers and full members of the professional teaching team. One owner takes responsibility for the day-to-day management and leadership of the centre. The owners are supported by a high ratio of qualified teachers. The teaching team is well-established and work well together. Low staff turnover has helped teachers to build close relationships with families over time.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is underpinned by the Montessori approach to education and strongly grounded in <em>Te Whariki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Horizons Montessori Preschool provides high quality education and care for children.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in learning and are confident and well supported to be self-managing and lead their own play. They persevere with their projects and activities and are proud of their successes. Teachers use deliberate strategies that help to grow children's social skills.</p><p>The well designed curriculum promotes children's overall development and learning. Children have extensive opportunities to investigate, initiate their own learning, and be imaginative and creative. Teachers integrate through play daily opportunities for children to develop early skills in reading, writing and mathematics. This ensures that children see these skills as meaningful and worthwhile. The environment is designed to give children access to physical challenge and environmentally sustainable practices.</p><p>Teachers have strong and effective learning relationships with children. They are positive, sensitive and responsive to each learner. Skilled teaching practices facilitate children's play, language development and engagement in learning. Teachers are respectful and unhurried when working with children. They support children towards success and provide children with feedback that acknowledges their efforts.</p><p>Teachers' programme planning, assessment and evaluation is highly responsive and involves deliberate decision making about the priorities for children's learning. Centre systems ensure that children's individual plans for learning are inclusive of each child's community. The child, teacher, and family contribute to the planning, assessment and evaluation stages. Children's strengths, interests, culture, language and needs are all evident in planning. Children with additional learning needs are very well catered for in this highly individualised process.</p><p>A monthly centre plan, developed on the basis of children's emerging interests, helps teachers to extend learning opportunities for them. The programme is informed by children's questions that are used to drive purposeful learning inquires.</p><p>The centre benefits from highly capable professional leadership and co-operative team work. Leadership is knowledgeable and competent. The centre leader clearly articulates the centre vision and ensures that teachers have a common understanding about expectations for their professional practice. Decisions about professional learning and development opportunities are strategic and responsive to identified needs. The centre leader fosters collaborative ways of working that allow all of the members of the centre's community to contribute to improving learning outcomes.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have a very good understanding of internal evaluation. They use it well to improve the quality of education and support equitable outcomes for children. High quality evaluative practice is evident in the way that they use their evaluative findings to consider what they mean in terms of their teaching roles and any changes to practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>While te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated into the programme and the environment<em>,</em> centre leaders are appropriately planning to continue increasing teachers' capability and collective capacity to provide a high quality authentic bicultural curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Horizons Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Horizons Montessori Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>2 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
