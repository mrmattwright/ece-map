<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centre 16 Preschool, in Orewa, Auckland, provides very good quality care and education for up to 50 children between three and five years of age. It is one of two licensed centres that operate on the same site, catering for children of different ages. The centre operates under the national umbrella of the Kindercare organisation.</p><p align="left">The 2008 ERO report acknowledged the centre&rsquo;s inclusive and welcoming environment and the very good learning opportunities provided for children. These good practices continue to characterise the centre. ERO recommended that staff be supported to further develop programme planning and assessment practices for an emergent curriculum. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool is a well managed centre. Expectations of staff and children are clear. The centre director has developed an environment of trust. Staff contribute to decisions made in the centre and work together as a team to support the individual needs of children. Positive partnerships between the centre and parents and wh&#257;nau are evident.</p><p align="left">Teachers focus on being responsive to children. They respond in genuine ways to child-initiated conversations, affirm children&rsquo;s efforts, and encourage their involvement in a variety of learning experiences. High numbers of qualified staff contribute to positive interactions between adults and children and help to ensure that children&rsquo;s individual learning needs are met. Children are well socialised, and are developing good self-managing skills.</p><p align="left">The Kindercare organisation has established a framework of administrative, personnel and support systems to underpin centre operations. The centre director and supervisor offer strong professional leadership. Self-review systems are in place to help the centre to continue to develop in positive ways. ERO and centre managers agree that teachers should continue to integrate identified foundation skills for learning into planning and assessment practices to support positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centre 16 Preschool operates in three separate rooms. The Preschool 1 room caters for children between three and four years of age. Preschool 2 and Preschool 3 are separate rooms catering for four year olds. The three Preschool rooms have a shared outdoor space.</p><p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO review a new centre director and centre supervisor have been appointed. Both of these appointments were internal promotions for existing staff. Low staff turnover is a positive feature of the centre.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Relationships and interactions</h4><p align="left">Staff are friendly, and are affirming and encouraging of children and each other. Team work is evident and supports the development of a positive centre culture. Children are respected, are comfortable to interact with adults, and play happily alongside each other.</p><h4 align="left">Partnerships with parents</h4><p align="left">Staff are welcoming of parents/wh&#257;nau. The stability of staff means that parents and children benefit from getting to know individual staff well. Staff make frequent links to home in their conversations with children. The centre communicates with parents and provides information through a range of sources, including a number of informative displays. A continuation of successful strategies invites and affirms parents&rsquo; contributions to the learning and development of their child at the centre. Teachers value and respond to the contributions and information that parents share about their children.</p><h4 align="left">Learning environment</h4><p align="left">The centre is attractive, print-rich, and well resourced. Children move freely between the uncluttered indoor and outdoor environments. The outdoor environment is set up to provide children with physical challenge and opportunities for exploration and discovery. Resources are easily accessible for children, assisting them to make independent choices. Children&rsquo;s work is displayed with pride. Children respect and care for the resources around them.</p><h4 align="left">Approaches to programme planning and assessment</h4><p align="left">Teachers implement effective planning and assessment practices that enable them to support in-depth learning for all children. These good practices include developing programmes from children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths and recording learning stories that explain the learning that has taken place and identify the next learning steps. Planning is displayed for families and children to revisit.</p><h4 align="left">Professional support</h4><p align="left">The centre director and centre supervisor are well supported by the Kindercare organisation in fulfilling their management and curriculum roles. Systems, processes and practices are implemented consistently across the centre. A national Kindercare framework guides review at all levels of centre operation. Good use is made of this regular review to support ongoing improvement. An emphasis on team building has strengthened teachers&rsquo; skills in using collaborative practices to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">Centre managers and ERO agree that the following are useful steps that would support further integration of the Kindercare Foundation Skills for learning in the Preschool rooms:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">supporting the extension of children&rsquo;s language skills to promote deeper thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">extending opportunities to integrate the learning of early literacy skills into children&rsquo;s play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing how centre routines impact on children&rsquo;s opportunities to revisit learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h4><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau move into the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre currently has a small number of Maori children attending. Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education plan for promoting success for M&#257;ori, has been used to support centre goal setting.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Fostering relationships</h4><p align="left">A strength of the centre is its appreciation and commitment to building and fostering relationships with parents and families. The centre is welcoming and staff inform, and maintain contact with, parents/wh&#257;nau through a number of strategies. Centre leaders acknowledge the value of meeting with parents/wh&#257;nau face to face.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4 align="left">Working in partnership with parents of M&#257;ori children</h4><p align="left">Centre staff should consider how to promote positive and supportive relationships, specifically with parents/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children. They could explore ways of documenting how the centre intends to respond to the aspirations of parents/wh&#257;nau for their children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers acknowledge the need to strengthen the use of M&#257;ori language and perspectives in programme planning.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-kindercare-learning-centres-16-preschool" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Kindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool.</p><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centre 16 Preschool, in Orewa, Auckland, provides very good quality care and education for up to 50 children between three and five years of age. It is one of two licensed centres that operate on the same site, catering for children of different ages. The centre operates under the national umbrella of the Kindercare organisation.</p><p align="left">The 2008 ERO report acknowledged the centre&rsquo;s inclusive and welcoming environment and the very good learning opportunities provided for children. These good practices continue to characterise the centre. ERO recommended that staff be supported to further develop programme planning and assessment practices for an emergent curriculum. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres 16 Preschool is a well managed centre. Expectations of staff and children are clear. The centre director has developed an environment of trust. Staff contribute to decisions made in the centre and work together as a team to support the individual needs of children. Positive partnerships between the centre and parents and wh&#257;nau are evident.</p><p align="left">Teachers focus on being responsive to children. They respond in genuine ways to child-initiated conversations, affirm children&rsquo;s efforts, and encourage their involvement in a variety of learning experiences. High numbers of qualified staff contribute to positive interactions between adults and children and help to ensure that children&rsquo;s individual learning needs are met. Children are well socialised, and are developing good self-managing skills.</p><p align="left">The Kindercare organisation has established a framework of administrative, personnel and support systems to underpin centre operations. The centre director and supervisor offer strong professional leadership. Self-review systems are in place to help the centre to continue to develop in positive ways. ERO and centre managers agree that teachers should continue to integrate identified foundation skills for learning into planning and assessment practices to support positive outcomes for children.</p></html>
