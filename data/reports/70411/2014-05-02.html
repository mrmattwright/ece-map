</table><p>Managers have systems and practices in place for the operation of the centre. These need to be more robust to ensure good quality education and care for all children. While management is introducing a new appraisal system, at the time of this review, the process for providing staff with robust feedback on their teaching practice was not in place. Teachers need significant support to review how planned programmes for children‚Äôs learning reflect the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New¬†Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. ERO has concerns about the level of education and care in the nursery where routines are not always responsive to the needs of infants and toddlers.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Minnies Pre-School is one of four privately owned early childhood centres owned and administered by Canterbury Early Learning Centres Limited. The centre has a nursery for infants and toddlers under two years of age and a preschool for those from two to school age. The centre is preparing to meet the <em>2008 Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres.</em></p><p>While the centre had a significant drop in roll following the Christchurch earthquakes, it is now operating at near full capacity. A new management structure has recently been established. This includes the appointment of a business manager to support the managers and teachers across all four centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Managers and teachers have put considerable thought into carefully planned learning environments. Activities are attractively presented and invite children to engage in productive play. Clearly defined spaces support individual and small group play.</p><p>Teachers notice children‚Äôs interest well. They use this information to provide a range of suitable resources to extend their ideas in the nursery and preschool. This suitable range of resources enables children to have good opportunities for choice and selection. Teachers also make good use of the wider community to build on children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>Teachers have good relationships with children in the preschool. They effectively foster friendships between children. Conversations are relaxed and relate well to children‚Äôs interests and home life.</p><p>During times of unstructured learning in the preschool, teachers actively encouraged children to make choices by asking good questions and offering suggestions. Teachers offered children other related opportunities and useful resources to increase their focus and participation. Where children were making their own choices, there was a depth of learning and good cooperation as they shared ideas and explored.</p><p>Children with special needs are well supported. Teachers use an inclusive approach and work collaboratively to meet identified needs. These children benefit from well-planned individual learning programmes that involve teachers, parents and appropriate outside agencies.</p><p>There are good examples of assessment in children‚Äôs learning stories. These show:</p><ul>
<li>effective linking between stories and the development and learning of children over time</li>
<li>annual summaries that provide parents with a useful overview of their child‚Äôs progress</li>
<li>parent feedback that is used to inform next learning stories</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô understanding of the learning that is occurring for the child.</li>
</ul><p>Children have many opportunities to enjoy stories in the preschool and nursery. Teachers use a range of effective approaches to make stories interesting and meaningful to children. Te reo MƒÅori is consistently used during group times.</p><p>Managers value the views and opinions of teachers and parents in the development of a well formatted strategic plan. This, along with the annually updated philosophy, outlines the centre's aspirations and future direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers recognise the need to evaluate more thoroughly the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children. In order to achieve this, the key next steps are to make better use of the centre‚Äôs philosophy, strategic planning and self review. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring strong links between strategic planning, annual plans, professional development and appraisal</li>
</ul><p>increasing the use of self review to measure and recognise the steps taken towards meeting strategic goals</p><p>strengthening teachers' understanding and use of the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, (empowering children, holistic development, family and community and responsive and reciprocal relationships) in the teaching and learning programmes</p><ul>
<li>further improving programme planning and assessment.</li>
</ul><p>There is variation in the quality of interactions and care for children under two. Urgent review is needed to ensure the centre philosophy and the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are actioned in the nursery.</p><p>Centre leaders recognise that MƒÅori culture and cultural diversity need strengthening.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Minnies Pre-School completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>management and educators should use policies, objectives and practices which reflect the service‚Äôs philosophy, quality curriculum, current theories of learning and development, the requirements of the DOPs and legislation</li>
<li>management should use personnel policies which promote quality practices including staff appraisal and professional development for both management and educators.</li>
</ul><p><em>Revised Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices (DOPs) for Chartered Early Childhood Services 10(a), 11(a)</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Minnies Pre-School will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>2 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
