</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Tuingapapai o Uesile in Mangere is a well established early childhood centre under the umbrella of the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga (New Zealand). The centre operates two licences on the one site. Since the 2011 ERO review, extensions to the building have resulted in there being two licensed spaces. This part of the centre is licensed to provide care and education for 50 children from two years up to school age. In 2014 a review of the governance structure was completed. A Trust Board which includes parent representatives governs the two centres.</p><p>Since the time of the 2011 ERO review, a new centre manager has been appointed to oversee the operational aspects of the centre. The over two‚Äôs supervisor oversees the day to day operations of the two licences and works collaboratively with the infants and toddlers supervisor and centre manager. The centre is undergoing some further changes and is being renamed as Matavai Sila‚Äôi.</p><p>The majority of the teachers are registered and some are working towards full registration. All the leaders in the centre are new to their roles but not to the centre.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is to nurture the seed of ‚Äúloving to learn‚Äù in children and to grow their competence. The visual image for this philosophy is of a garland, threaded in the seven papai. The centre philosophy is evident in the curriculum. Children‚Äôs language and their physical, social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and cultural development are being promoted.</p><p>The programme is Christian based and guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The 2011 ERO report highlighted that the centre‚Äôs programme promotes Christian values and maintains the Tongan language and cultural identity of children. This continues to be the case. Tongan values, language and culture are embedded in the curriculum. Children are comfortable and strong in their identity.</p><p>Children are happy and settled. They are confident and comfortable in the centre. Children explore the environment and engage with the activities teachers provide. They know that they can set up their own play and activities and that teachers are close by to support them. Older children take care of and are gentle with younger children. They are also respectful towards each other and with adults. Children respond well to teachers‚Äô using te reo MƒÅori. They are familiar with waiata, and karakia.</p><p>The physical environment is well defined. New developments in the outdoor area have made it more accessible for children, especially in the winter months. Developments include ground matting and shade sails.</p><p>The programme is focused on children‚Äôs interests. Teachers include wider community events in their planning. Teachers have developed portfolios for children that capture the learning and activities children are involved in during their time at the centre. Teachers could now look at ways to encourage parents and whƒÅnau to regularly contribute to the record of learning in children‚Äôs portfolios.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô relationships with children and their families are positive and respectful. They know families well. Regular informal talks when parents are dropping off and picking up children, together with regular parent - teacher association (PTA) meetings, have strengthened relationships between the centre and families.</p><p>The centre manager is establishing effective management practices. He is strengthening systems and processes to encourage transparency and collaboration among staff. A newly appointed supervisor and regular team meetings are contributing to the growth and sharing of leadership within the service. Centre staff are focused on continuous improvement. Leaders agree that providing focussed external professional development should strengthen teaching and learning in the centre and help build leadership capacity.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to strengthen management, leadership and teaching practices in the centre, the Board of Trustees, centre leaders and ERO agree that together they should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the documentation of programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>develop more systematic self-review processes</li>
<li>review the effectiveness of the centre‚Äôs ‚Äútransition to school‚Äù programme</li>
<li>develop a strategic and annual plan to guide ongoing centre development</li>
<li>review documented policy and procedures to ensure they are current and up to date</li>
<li>review performance management systems to ensure they meet Practicing Teachers‚Äô Certificate requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Tuingapapai o Uesile completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO recommends that the Board of Trustees seek an ECE external advisor to work with management to review centre policies and procedures to ensure that they are current and provide better guidance for staff. For example, it is necessary for the centre to develop a protected disclosure policy and have a privacy officer.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Tuingapapai o Uesile will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
