<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Tutū home-based care service is located in Tauranga and is a community based early childhood service. It operates under the governance and management of Te Matahauariki o Tauranga Moana. Management’s objectives are to promote the rights of Māori people and communities within Tauranga, to participate confidently, and achieve in education and employment. Whānau benefit from being able to access additional social services within the Te Matahauariki o Tauranga Moana.</p><p>Tutū home-based care provides tamariki from birth to school age and their whānau with early childhood education and care in educarers homes. The service currently has one home-based network that covers a large demographic area within the Eastern and Western Bay of Plenty. The network is overseen by two qualified and registered teachers who oversee the quality of education and care. They provide support for educarers/whānau in their delivery of education and care. This is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The majority of tamariki are of Māori descent and whakapapa back to a number of iwi. Most tamariki receive home-based care from an adult within their own whānau. Te Ao Māori permeates the service. The values of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga and manaakitanga are embedded in all aspects of the service and home environments. Educarers and tamariki have close, trusting and loving relationships, which creates a positive atmosphere for learning. Tamariki experience a range of rich learning experiences, in a whānau-orientated environment. A feature of the learning programme is the real-life and meaningful experiences tamariki gain from visiting the local and wider community environments.</p><p>Coordinators support educarers in their roles and responsibilities through regular visits to the home. Educarers are well informed about Tutū home-based standards and have clear guidelines that outline expectations for practice, the delivery of quality of education and care, and meeting legislative requirements. They organise playgroups and outings that provide opportunities for tamariki and educarers to socialise. Coordinators are experienced teachers who model effective learning interactions with tamariki. They provide advice and additional resources through the services toy library to further support learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>This is the second review for Tutū. Since the last ERO review in 2010 the roll has increased. A new coordinator (programme manager) has been appointed and the other coordinator (early childhood manager), has been with the service since it opened. Both coordinators are responsible for visiting the tamariki and overseeing the quality of the network and report to the management and governance of Te Matahauariki o Tauranga Moana Māori Education Organisation. The organisation has objectives that include:</p><ul>
<li>promoting and maintaining the right of Māori people in Tauranga Moana to achieve high goals in education through the implementation of the Tauranga Moana Māori Education plan</li>
<li>encouraging and assisting Māori learners to be fluent and literate in te reo Māori and English</li>
<li>assisting and enhancing opportunities for Māori people to gain and continue in employment.</li>
</ul><p>Te Matahauariki O Tauranga Moana values are transferred into Tutū home-based care. Management are strong advocates for tamariki and whānau. They demonstrate through a range of practices and initiatives a commitment to removing barriers that may limit tamariki rights to participate in contextually meaningful early childhood education.</p><p>During this review, ERO visited five educarers’ homes and attended a play group session. Educarers and whānau had the opportunity to contribute their views about the quality of the service through a self-reporting questionnaire.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Educarers and tamariki have close and trusting relationships, which creates a positive atmosphere for learning across the network. The majority of tamariki receive home-based care from an adult within their own whānau. Te Ao Māori permeates the service. The values of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga and manakitanga are embedded in all aspects of the service and home environments. Many educarers are highly skilled and experienced in speaking te reo Māori. Tamariki holistic development is supported and they demonstrate confidence to participate in both NZ Pākehā and Māori contexts. The wairua and self esteem of all tamariki is nurtured, and their cultural identity is valued and affirmed.</p><p>Educarers are well informed about the service’s expectations for education and care. These guidelines clearly outline educarer’s practice, the delivery of quality education and care, and meeting early childhood regulation requirements.</p><p>The educational programme is inclusive of all tamariki and whānau. Tamariki experience a range of stimulating learning experiences within a whānau orientated environment. ERO observed some high-quality home environments where tamariki were encouraged to actively explore and extend their learning through having their interests and strengths recognised. Literacy and mathematical experiences are well supported and additional resources are provided by coordinators. A feature of the learning programme is the real life and meaningful experiences children gain from accessing the local and wider community environments. Many educarers are in close proximity to the beach, bush, rivers and lakes and make good use of these environments to enrich learning for tamariki.</p><p>The principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum are strongly reflected in educarer’s homes, and promoted by coordinators during play groups and home visits. Individual child portfolios provide a valuable record of tamariki participation and learning. Open and transparent communication among educarers, whānau and coordinators ensures tamariki holistic development is supported.</p><p>The trust board and experienced general manager of Te Matahauariki o Tauranga Moana provide effective support for coordinators in their management and leadership roles. Coordinators support educarers through regular visits to each home. During these visits coordinators discuss children’s interests with the educarer and use information from these discussions to provide additional resources from the service’s toy library to further extend play. Coordinators organise playgroups and outings that enable tamariki, whānau and educarers to socialise and network with one another. They model high-quality learning interactions with tamariki, and have established positive and respectful relationships with educarers, tamariki and whānau. Coordinators have access to external professional development and keep up to date with current theory and practice within early childhood education.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Coordinators have developed effective self-review practices. However, both ERO and the service agree there is a need to further strengthen the services self-review practices. This is necessary to enable coordinators and management to more effectively monitor and evaluate the quality of education and care Tutū provides. More effective and regular self review is necessary to provide a more consistent approach to monitoring the implementation of the organisations objectives and the services strategic and annual plans.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Tutū completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO found an area of non-compliance that was also identified in the October 2010 review: Management must:</p><ul>
<li>develop and implement policy and guidelines for appraising coordinators annually. <em>[Education (ECE) Regulations 2008 clause 47 (1) (a and e)</em></li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the service provider agree that:</p><ul>
<li>the programme manager and early childhood manager access relevant professional development in self review.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>3 February 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
