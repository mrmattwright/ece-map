</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Koraunui kindergarten is located in Stokes Valley and provides education and care for children aged from two to five years. Six-hour daily sessions are offered four days a week and one morning session is offered on a Friday. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further assisted by support staff. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The September 2012 ERO report identified areas requiring further development these included: assessment; planning and evaluation; the bicultural curriculum; self review including of mat time routine; and adding complexity to childrens&rsquo; learning. Teachers have engaged in professional learning and development and appropriate changes have been made to teaching practice.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in sustained play and learning in a child-led programme. Those with additional learning needs are well supported and monitored and where appropriate teachers liaise with external agencies. Teachers work alongside children to support and extend their learning. Relationships are warm and responsive.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy has recently been reviewed in consultation with the community. This provides a shared direction for the teaching programme. Developing clear indicators of good practice should further support the effective implementation.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are promoted in the curriculum. Teachers should give greater consideration to the wider range of literacies and how these can be integrated into the play-based philosophy. Teachers have developed a number of strategies to support childrens&rsquo; transition to school. A next step is for teachers to formalise a shared understanding of successful transition processes and to reflect these in the teaching practice and kindergarten&rsquo;s procedures.</p><p>Teachers have engaged in professional learning and development, with a focus on building their bicultural practice. This has strengthened their use of te reo M&#257;ori me ng&#257; tikanga. Consultation has occurred with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. This feedback has resulted in greater emphasis on each child&rsquo;s culture, language and identity. Teachers have indentified they should regularly consult with the wh&#257;nau to better respond to their aspirations. ERO's evaluation affirms this planned development.</p><p>Promoting success for Pacific children is developing. Teachers have drawn on the strengths of the kindergarten&rsquo;s community to support their developing understanding of how to better reflect and celebrate Pacific cultures in the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have identified that assessment, planning and evaluation is an area for development. With support from the association, teachers should reflect on the purpose of assessment to inform their teaching practice. Planning is child centred and responds to childrens&rsquo; emerging interests. Clearly stating the learning goal and the teaching strategies should better inform the ongoing assessment and evaluation of the programme.</p><p>Self review is in the early stage of development. Teachers should use the self-review framework provided by the association. In addition, they should build their capacity to evaluate their practice. The head teacher has a clear vision for the kindergarten that provides direction for staff. A consultative approach has been used to guide the kindergarten programmes and initiatives.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. Leaders should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to provide more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to M&#257;ori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The PPMs provide half-yearly written reports. These provide information about how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements, and at times, make recommendations. These reports should be strengthened by providing critical feedback on the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations, that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
</ul><p>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>At the time of this review, the association was involved in a process of a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt Kindergartens. ERO identified that, within the current operating model, the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO indentified priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing clear indicators of good practice based on the kindergarten&rsquo;s teaching philosophy</li>
<li>increasing the range of literacies in the kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum</li>
<li>developing a shared understanding of the purpose and use of assessment</li>
<li>using the association&rsquo;s self-review framework and building teachers&rsquo; evaluative capacity.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level, identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to M&#257;ori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Koraunui Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Koraunui Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
