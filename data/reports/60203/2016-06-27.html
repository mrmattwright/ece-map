</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pauatahanui Preschool is a community‚Äìbased centre situated in the grounds of Pauatahanui School and serves the wider Pauatahanui and Whitby communities. It is licensed for 23 children from two years of age and operates for school hours Monday to Thursday, with a morning session on Friday. There are four MƒÅori children, one Pacific child and four children with additional learning needs enrolled.</p><p>The Head Teacher is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre. A parent management committee provides governance. The preschool employs a team of four qualified teachers. Two new teachers were appointed in January 2016.</p><p>The July 2013 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included educational success for MƒÅori, gathering parent aspirations, appraisal, self review and assessment, planning and evaluation. Progress in these areas is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are actively engaged in a play-based curriculum. They are supported to lead their own learning. Mathematics and literacy are effectively included through interactions and the programme. Some extension of children's thinking is evident. Teachers are warm, respectful and responsive in their interactions with children and parents and know them well.</p><p>Teachers are committed to inclusive practices. Diverse learners with additional learning needs are well supported and partnerships with their parents are strong. Relevant liaison with external agencies occurs.</p><p>Te reo MƒÅori is regularly used at routine times and aspects of tikanga MƒÅori are included throughout the curriculum. Leaders and teachers have identified that a next step is to more purposefully integrate te reo MƒÅori throughout the curriculum. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>Professional learning and development supports teachers to develop their bicultural competency and to incorporate local MƒÅori history and knowledge into the programme in a meaningful and respectful manner. This should also enhance teachers' understanding of how to promote educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>An appropriate process guides planning. It reflects children‚Äôs interests and is clearly underpinned by the preschool's teaching philosophy. A next step as a new team, is to more clearly identify intended outcomes for children and develop shared understandings of how these are supported by teaching practice. In addition, evaluation should be strengthened to determine how effectively teachers' strategies and the planned programme promote children's learning.</p><p>Portfolios are attractively presented, include parent aspirations and provide a record of children‚Äôs interests and engagement in the programme. A key next step is for leaders and teachers to develop a shared understanding of assessment for learning. As a result, documentation should better describe the complexity of children‚Äôs learning and more consistently show children‚Äôs progress over time.</p><p>A comprehensive appraisal system informed by the Practising Teacher Criteria and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> is being implemented. The process includes teacher inquiry and reflection, and observations of teachers' practice. Regular feedback is provided and informs ongoing development. A supportive induction process for new teachers is in place.</p><p>Self review is improvement-focused and drives changes in practice. A key next step is for leaders and teachers to further develop their understanding of how the components of this process contribute to effective internal evaluation.</p><p>The head teacher provides effective leadership with a strong commitment to teaching and learning that contributes to equitable outcomes for all children. This leadership successfully fosters collaborative ways of working with teachers, parents and whƒÅnau, and the parent management committee.</p><p>The committee demonstrates a sound understanding of their governance roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and Leaders agree that key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' understanding of assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integration of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori throughout the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pauatahanui Preschool Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pauatahanui Preschool Inc. will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
