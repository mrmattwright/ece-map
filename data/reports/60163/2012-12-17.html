<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Barnardos KidStart Wainuiomata provides home-based care and learning for children from birth to five years, in a KidStart educator&rsquo;s home. The network operates under the umbrella of Barnardos New Zealand, and is managed through the KidStart Lower Hutt office. Management set high expectations for service delivery and provide a comprehensive range of policies and procedures to guide professional practice at all levels. Local leadership and management practices foster good quality care and education and help to support ongoing improvements.</p><p>Relationships between adults and children are cooperative, friendly and trusting. Educators interact responsively with children, allowing them to make choices and play freely. Children&rsquo;s sense of belonging is nurtured and their learning promoted in happy environments. Educators choose activities that reflect children&rsquo;s interests. These opportunities are further supplemented through additional resources provided by KidStart. Children in home-based care arrangements experience the wider community through outings to the parks, library and places of interest in the local community. Additional opportunities to socialise with other children through attending a regular playgroup are offered through the network. Children enjoy friendships with their peers and play is cooperative.</p><p>A visiting teacher, who is the qualified early childhood teacher, regularly visits educators and children in the educator&rsquo;s home. This teacher is responsible for providing support and guidance for the educators and making sure the homes meet health and safety standards. Educators are well supported in their roles by KidStart staff and children receive the care and education they need. All educators have initial and ongoing professional learning opportunities and receive a practice certificate from Barnardos that is renewed every two years.</p><p>This ERO review evaluates the quality of education and care provided by a sample group of educators, and the quality of support provided by Barnardos KidStart management.</p><p>ERO and managers have agreed that the next steps for development include self review, programme evaluation, educators&rsquo; assessment documentation and exploring ways to promote success for M&#257;ori.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the service&rsquo;s 2009 ERO review Barnardos KidStart services have been restructured. Longserving staff continue to manage the Wainuiomata network and promote ongoing improvements to the quality of education and care practices for children.</p><p>Educators agree to participate in a range of professional learning opportunities which Barnardos KidStart appropriately facilitates over the course of the year. There is an expectation that educators will support the learning and development of each child through the provision of programmes aligned to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and regularly document children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Children spend the majority of their time in child-centred play. They play amicably with and alongside educators and peers. Their curiosity and interests are stimulated by appropriately presented activities in family homes. ERO observed educators interacting warmly and positively with children. They are encouraged to listen, take turns, share ideas and communicate with others. Educators are welcoming and respond promptly to children&rsquo;s requests and physical and emotional needs. The children&rsquo;s records of learning (toku pukapuka) prepared by the educators, highlight children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme and developing relationships.</p><p>Environments in homes are well equipped with a variety of appropriate resources which are further supplemented by KidStart. Children have access to spacious outdoor learning environments. Educators make thoughtful use of facilities in their area to extend the learning experiences. These include visits to playgroup, library and a variety of other events in the community. Educators are committed to the recent focus on biculturalism and are ably supported by the visiting teacher who effectively models the use of te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p>The visiting teacher and team leader have an overview of the quality of education and care provided and are highly aware of children&rsquo;s wellbeing and learning. The caring and professional relationship, that the visiting teacher maintains with educators, supports and extends their practice in early childhood education. Clear records of their visits to each child and educator are kept and are guidance for educators&rsquo; use of narrative assessment. KidStart provides educators with a wide range of appropriate resources to support them in their work with children. In addition, the playgroup is well used to further develop educators&rsquo; learning in different areas, most recently on te reo M&#257;ori. Educators stated they appreciate the level and timeliness of the support they receive.</p><p>Managers have recently reviewed and modified performance appraisal processes. The new model for visiting teachers and team leaders is appropriately reflective and likely to support professional growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Barnardos KidStart continues to provide clear and appropriate guidelines to support children&rsquo;s health and wellbeing. Expectations of educators are well communicated. Roles and responsibilities of managers, team leaders and visiting teachers have been established. The service uses equity funding to benefit children. It frequently reports to parents how this funding is used.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Evidence-based self review is developing. The process should continue to be refined to enable managers to make judgements about the quality and impact of the programme for children and their families. Consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>clarifying the difference between review and development</li>
<li>framing reviews around an evaluative question</li>
<li>gathering more comprehensive and well analysed data to provide recommendations for continuous improvement.</li>
</ul><p>When a rigorous system is in place, priorities for review should include the quality of the literacy and numeracy programme offered to children by the educators.</p><p>Assessment practices have been identified by managers and teachers as requiring further development. Leaders should support the visiting teacher to develop a clear understanding of planning and documenting assessment for learning in this context. This shared understanding should better support educators to meet the expectations of Barnardos. In addition, educators should enact the planned next steps for children&rsquo;s learning to help show continuity of learning opportunities and progress over time.</p><p>Planning for the playgroup is based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, is responsive and reflects the holistic way children learn. This should be strengthened through regularly evaluating the quality of the programme to identify outcomes for children.</p><p>Managers in partnership with teachers, educators, wh&#257;nau and the local community should consider investigating further what success for M&#257;ori children might look like in this home-based context.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Barnardos Kidstart Wainuiomata completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice Barnardos KidStart should also state in the annual report that is presented at the annual general meeting how they have spent their Equity Funding. The report must include:</p><ul>
<li>an outline of the amount received under each of the Equity Funding components</li>
<li>a brief description of the purpose to which the funding was applied</li>
<li>a brief outline of the reasons for spending the funding in that way.</li>
