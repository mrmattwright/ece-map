</table><p>Fendalton Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fendalton Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. It is licensed for 25 children, including 10 aged under two. The playcentre is open four mornings a week and holds one afternoon Babies Can Play session.</p><p>The playcentre employs a coordinator. Parents are rostered to help at each session. The Upper South Island Region employs a centre support person and an administrator who regularly visit the playcentre to support the parents and coordinator.</p><p>The playcentre's philosophy emphasises the importance of parents and children learning together through play. Enabling children to choose and follow their interests is a key focus. Fostering a learning community where adults and children play, work and learn together is valued.</p><p>Parents have made good progress towards meeting the recommendations of the 2014 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight Playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and fully engaged in their learning. They have access to a rich curriculum which is based on their interests and links to home and centre learning. The playcentre is well resourced and organised. Parents' expertise is drawn on for designing an interesting curriculum and extending options for children's learning. Children work, play and learn comfortably alongside other children of all ages and adults. Younger children are supported by adults and older children in a safe and responsive environment. Children easily access and select resources and activities that interest them.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of identity and belonging. Their cultures are recognised, valued and included in the programme. Children with additional needs, and those from diverse cultures benefit from caring relationships between parents and children. The high ratio of adults to children helps to ensure children's learning and wellbeing are well provided for. The centre is caring, welcoming and inclusive. Children are happy and settled.</p><p>Young children's transition into and within the centre is effectively managed. Many parents participate in 'babies can play' as a transition into the playcentre sessions. They bring the wide range of skills they have learnt in this programme to daily sessions. Parents need to continue to develop the transition to school programme for older children.</p><p>Parents work effectively as a cooperative in building each other's capacity and in accessing support from the Upper South Island Region. They collaboratively work together in sharing the responsibilities involved in operating the centre, including developing the curriculum. The centre builds the capacity of new parents well, so they can engage in centre processes.</p><p>There is a useful process in place for assessment and planning. Parents have an in-depth understanding of the process and capture learning well because of support from the coordinator and more experienced parents, as well as parent education training. The centre now needs to identify and document clearer links between parents' aspirations for children's learning, learning that takes place and subsequent outcomes. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and Pacific language and culture also need to be made more visible.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used well to identify and improve what is important for children's learning. The centre is effective in including parent and children's voice in internal evaluation. It is continuing to build wider parent involvement in the internal evaluation process. The centre is also making good use of strategic planning. Adults now need to extend strategic planning by monitoring progress towards goals and documenting the impact of change made, including outcomes for children.</p><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Upper South Island Region, the playcentre and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen strategic planning by monitoring progress towards goals and documenting the impact of change, including outcomes for children</li>
<li>improve assessment and planning by documenting clearer links between parent aspirations, learning that takes place and subsequent outcomes</li>
<li>make te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and Pacific language and culture more visible in assessment and planning</li>
<li>continue to develop its programme for supporting older children's transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fendalton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>16 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
