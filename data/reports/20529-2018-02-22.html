</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>West Harbour Whizz Kidz is licensed to provide all day care and education for up to 66 children including 20 aged under two years. Children aged under three have their own separate indoor and outdoor play spaces. Children come from an increasingly diverse range of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre owner manages the centre. She leads a team of four other qualified teachers, one teacher in training and one unqualified teacher.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is strongly based on children learning through play, and recognises each child as unique. Teachers acknowledge their responsibility towards honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and ensuring that the culture, language and identity of Māori are protected and enhanced. The development of positive, respectful relationships with children and their whānau is important to the teaching team.</p><p>Key next steps from the 2014 ERO report included the development of strategic planning, strengthening parent contributions, and a review of teacher led aspects of the programme. There has been good progress in these areas. Centre leaders and teachers continue to work with an external professional development provider to establish a robust internal evaluation process.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display a sense of belonging in the centre environment. Centre routines allow for long periods of uninterrupted play. This allows older children to engage in imaginative and dramatic play where they set the scene, negotiate roles and learn to play co-operatively together. Strong friendships among the children are evident.</p><p>Children under three are well supported by teachers to make decisions about their play, and to be independent and responsible. Children are well respected. The relaxed pace of the programme allows all children to take their time, and to initiate and make decisions about their play.</p><p>Te ao Māori perspectives are becoming more widely included in programme planning as teachers' bicultural knowledge and confidence grows. Some teachers are skilled in their knowledge of te reo Māori, and include words and phrases in children's portfolios. Teachers could consider how they might use te reo more in their daily interactions with children and each other.</p><p>Teachers have established positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. They genuinely listen to them, encouraging and respecting their verbal language and conversations. Teachers recognise and support children's interests in literacy and mathematics at an individual level. They make links across time and activities to revisit children's ideas and interests.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO acknowledged the positive relationships established with centre staff, and the regular information they received about their child's learning. Parent aspirations for their children's learning are visible in programme planning processes.</p><p>Children's portfolios are individual to each child. They show continuity of learning, and are easily accessible to children and whānau. Teachers analyse learning stories well to identify individual learning, and to plan possible learning pathways that support more complex thinking. Curriculum planning and evaluation processes continue to evolve as the team undertakes ongoing professional development in this area.</p><p>Teachers are committed to teaching and learning that creates positive outcomes for children. The teaching team is becoming collaborative, and teachers are encouraged to contribute to an organisational culture of continual improvement. The manager provides good opportunities for teachers to develop professionally.</p><p>The manager has established annual and strategic plans, in consultation with teachers that will guide centre direction. The vision and mission statements are evident in teachers' and manager's practice. Managers should continue developing systems for ongoing review, and policies and procedures that meet current legislative requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have discussed with ERO key next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>developing alignment between annual and strategic plans, internal evaluation and teacher appraisal</li>
<li>ensuring children's portfolios include links to their languages, and cultures</li>
<li>continuing to develop programme planning processes that are context specific</li>
<li>reviewing centre resources to include more natural materials, and ensure all play areas inspire children's critical thought, wondering and creativity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of West Harbour Whizz Kidz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>A systematic and prioritised review plan needs to be established to ensure centre policies and procedures continue to meet current legislation.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of West Harbour Whizz Kidz will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>22 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
