</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centre - Albany¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre - Albany is owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Limited. All centres operate under the Kindercare vision, values, philosophy and strategic goals. Together these form the philosophy on which each centre and the organisation base their practices.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age in three separate rooms. The youngest children have their own outdoor play space. Children and their families come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Many families speak more than one language.</p><p>A centre director leads a team of eight qualified teachers, one of whom leads curriculum planning. A number of the teachers have been with Kindercare for many years.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted the positive and warm relationships between teachers, children and whƒÅnau. Children's easy access to resources for learning in a homely environment supported their sense of belonging and developing confidence. These aspects of quality practice have been maintained. Areas for further development were programme planning, partnerships with parents and the bicultural focus of self review. There has been good progress in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight Kindercare Learning Centre reviews in the Auckland area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are generally well settled and engaged and make choices about their play. Environments are calm and peaceful. Effective teaching practices include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>nurturing care that supports children's wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attractively presented, very well resourced learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>purposeful modelling of oral language through naturally occurring conversations with children that contribute to building deeper relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good support for children to develop social competence and the skills to initiate and maintain friendships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep respect for children's work and creativity, which supports children's developing confidence and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The small group size for infants and toddlers supports quality care and education. Teachers respond positively to children's individual routines and rhythms. Daily journals for younger children share important information between home and centre, supporting teachers' partnerships with parents.</p><p>Through regular surveys, parents share how much they value the positive, respectful relationships teachers have established with their children. Leaders and teachers are responsive to suggestions and parents' ideas about changes to systems and routines. They are considering ways to increase parents' knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers and leaders focus on promoting a sense of wellbeing and belonging for tamariki MƒÅori. Connections to te ao MƒÅori can be seen through sensitive additions to resources. Cultural diversity is also visible in centre resources.</p><p>Programme planning is based on teachers' observations of children's interests and learning dispositions. Teachers thoughtfully prepare environments that encourage children to think, explore and discover. They could now consider providing opportunities for children to independently revisit their learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work well together as a team. The centre is managed effectively. An internal evaluation process encourages teachers to reflect on and modify their practice. Through this process centre strategic goals have surfaced. The development of an improvement focused annual plan could support the attainment of these goals.</p><p>The Kindercare organisation provides a broad range of support for centres and families. Comprehensive management and accountability systems across the company include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support for centre directors through regular visits by area managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal, mentoring and well targeted professional development that supports teachers to build their capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that their key next steps include continuing to develop teachers' knowledge and use of the revised early childhood curriculum in order to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to support the development of a rich learning programme for each child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a meaningful curriculum in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build partnerships with whƒÅnau that are based on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next Steps for the Organisation</h3><p>Key next steps for the Kindercare organisation include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>make progress with ensuring the company's vision, values, philosophy, systems and practices reflect and enact the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate how consistently leaders, including area managers and centre directors, build teachers‚Äô capability and improve practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed practices that support leaders' ongoing commitment to strengthening, and reporting about the outcomes of, strategic planning and internal evaluation across the organisation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre - Albany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centre - Albany will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>29 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
