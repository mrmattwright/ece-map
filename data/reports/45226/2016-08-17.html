</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Giggles Learning Centre is near Kensington in Whangarei. It provides for up to 30 children, with infants and toddlers in the Teina room in their own outdoor space, and older children in the Tuakana areas.</p><p>The centre's owner manages the centre and employs six other registered teachers. She demonstrates a high level of commitment to providing a bicultural service that foregrounds Te Tiriti o Waitangi and enacts <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It is strongly influenced by <em>Te Whatu Pōkeka</em>, a kaupapa Māori framework for assessing children's learning. All aspects of centre operations are underpinned by the concepts of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga, whakamana and kaitiakitanga.</p><p>ERO's 2013 review recognised whānau relationships, the support that teachers provide for whānau, cultural inclusion and the integration of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori as strengths. It identified effective management and well considered planning. ERO suggested improvements in strategic planning, self review and the provision of more consistent support for child-led learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are comfortable and have a sense of belonging in this centre. Teachers have a purposeful approach to fostering children's social competence and promoting positive interactions. They have an intentional focus on supporting children's belief in their own capability, their developing sense of mana and pride in their identity as Māori. Teachers maintain a calm tone, sit alongside children to support play and model appropriate interactions. Whānau and staff appreciate the aroha that underpins relationships at Giggles.</p><p>The owner and teachers recognise the specialised nature of providing infant and toddler programmes. The Teina room is attractively presented and the small outdoor play area is also inviting and appropriately resourced. Teachers provide nurturing care and thoughtful support for learning that is responsive to individual children's preferences, interests and needs. A centre-wide whānau approach ensures that transitions from Teina to Tuakana are flexible and children move easily between the two areas. </p><p>Older children are confident to initiate conversations with adults and there are high levels of cooperative interaction amongst children as they play. They are able to choose from the selection of activities and resources available and find creative ways to use equipment. Children are physically active and often sustain imaginative play for long periods. They have opportunities to experiment with drawing and writing, and to include mathematical concepts in their play. Children's individual assessment portfolios are a valued record of children's engagement in the programme and reflect the Giggles kaupapa.</p><p>The owner and teachers have engaged in a variety of opportunities to extend their understanding about kaupapa Māori approaches to early childhood education. Teachers incorporate te reo me ngā tikanga Maori during the programme in a variety of ways. They are proactive in building their knowledge and confidence to help them to enact their vision of providing a bilingual programme for children.</p><p>Teachers use their professional learning and research to reflect on and improve their practices. This reflection has led to the development of new approaches to planning and assessment. It has helped them to more closely identify and respond to individual children's strengths and interests and to better reflect <em>Te Whatu Pōkeka</em>. They continue to explore ways for whānau to engage in the assessment and planning processes. They are working towards making their partnerships with whānau more visible in centre documentation. The increasing use of online communications should support this development.</p><p>There is very good alignment between teachers' philosophical beliefs and centre practices, including a collaborative leadership model. Together, the owner and teachers plan for centre development under the headings of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga, whakamana and kaitiakitanga. The goals identified in this planning inform specific annual plans.</p><p><em>Te Whatu Pōk</em>eka has also influenced the development of an aromatawai framework for internal evaluation. This framework supports systematic and cyclical, as well as spontaneous, evaluation for improvement. A very good process of appraisal and mentoring is a critical factor in affirming and encouraging teachers' ongoing professional growth.</p><p>The owner and teachers have established a strong foundation for continuing the journey towards their vision of an authentically bicultural service for tamariki and their whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As several recent developments in the centre have required significant shifts in thinking, the owner and teachers are focused on refining and consolidating new practices in a measured approach to strategic development. As part of this ongoing process, it is timely for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>develop ways to plan for more complex, extended learning over time</li>
<li>examine the presentation and ease of independent access for children to a wide variety of resources, to better reflect a view of children as competent, capable self-directed learners</li>
<li>deepen their reflection and analysis, and improve their documentation of the aromatawai process</li>
<li>refine their aromatawai by using evaluative questions and having a clearer focus on learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Giggles Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Giggles Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 August 2016<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
