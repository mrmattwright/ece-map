</table><p>Abacus Montessori Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Since the previous ERO review in April 2012, Abacus Montessori Preschool has undergone some significant changes, including new ownership. The two new owners are also the centre managers. There have been some staffing changes although the head teachers in each area have been retained. The name of the centre has remained the same.</p><p>The curriculum is based on a blend of the Montessori philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New¬†Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. One of the new owners has recently achieved a diploma in Montessori Early Childhood Education. Other staff at the centre are actively encouraged to do this specialised training, in addition to a range of other professional development opportunities.</p><p>The vision for the centre is that children learn together in a fun, safe, environment. There are four specific learning spaces to cater for children aged three months to five years old. The learning environment has been enhanced. This includes both the inside and outside play spaces.</p><p>The leadership team is involved in a community education cluster that includes local schools and other early childhood centres.</p><p>The owner/managers, with the support of an external advisor, have addressed all of the recommendations from the 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers foster a strong sense of belonging for children. They work closely with parents to ensure a positive transition into the nursery and the preschool area. Teachers take time to talk with parents about their children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities to help them support children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Children‚Äôs independent and social skills are actively encouraged. Teachers provide nurturing and caring interactions that promote respectful relationships and care for one another.</p><p>Children have access to a wide range of good quality Montessori learning resources and creative activities. Literacy, numeracy, and music are a focus of the learning programme. Purposeful links to the community, and trips within the local area, enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>The curriculum reflects aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. This includes use of natural materials and care for the environment. Teachers are currently being supported by a staff member, who has strengths in te ao MƒÅori, to further develop their understandings and confidence.</p><p>Teachers benefit from professional development to support programme planning and assessment practice. This includes the use of a range of effective teaching strategies to engage children in learning, and plan for and document progress of learning over time. They are excited about, and responsive to new learning.</p><p>The wellbeing of infants and toddlers in the nursery area is well supported through positive and sensitive interactions. Teachers actively involve children in predictable care routines to support children‚Äôs sense of security and a positive sense of self. They are responsive to the individual needs and preferences of children. Children are given time and space to explore, play and have fun.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs learning and involvement in the programme through attractive wall displays, informative individual profile books and regular meetings.</p><p>The owner/managers make good use of external professional development to build governance and management systems and practices. They work collaboratively with staff. They value and make good use of teacher‚Äôs strengths. These approaches are strengthening leadership and teaching practices.</p><p>There is a strong focus on developing self-review capacity across the team. A systematic approach to self review is resulting in positive outcomes for teaching and learning.</p><p>Long and short-term planning clearly identifies the service‚Äôs priorities and associated goals towards achieving its vision. The centre owners/managers promote a strong focus on ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further refine and embed recent developments in self review, appraisal, programme planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build te ao MƒÅori understandings and bicultural practices; and reflect this in guiding documents.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that the leadership team should review how the learning spaces can be used more effectively to benefit all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abacus Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Abacus Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
