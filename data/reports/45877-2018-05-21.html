</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Flatbush offers all-day and sessional early childhood education and care. The centre has a maximum of 100 children including 25 up to the age of two years. Children from three months to five years are catered for in four age-related learning areas.</p><p>Children enrolled are from many different backgrounds, and diversity is celebrated and embraced. A commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand underpins the centre's vision and practice.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes a strong sense of belonging founded on respectful and meaningful relationships between children, teachers and parents. It emphasises the need for a caring and holistic environment that challenges and stimulates children to explore and create. Individualised learning is at the heart of the centre's curriculum.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review noted some areas of good practice including effective learning environments and programmes that focused on children's interests. The use of home languages to support children's learning was a strength of the centre. This review confirms that the centre has sustained and built on those areas of good practice. Since 2014 there have been several new personnel appointments.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven education and care service reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's whƒÅnau-centred philosophy is evident in the centre's systems and operations and in the value placed on families' cultural identities and languages. Inclusive practices affirm and empathise with families who come to the centre from the neighbourhood, from other localities or from other countries.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are building positive learning partnerships with parents, and are committed to finding ways for families to contribute to their children's learning programmes. Children are supported to transition into and through the centre and on to primary school. There are good integration processes for children with additional needs and they are supported to enjoy and learn within the centre programmes.</p><p>Infants and toddlers form attachments to teachers quickly and settle well. The teachers use specific care approaches and warm and nurturing experiences that enable infants and toddlers to develop positively. Children benefit from highly personalised routines that align with families' home routines.</p><p>The centre has an authentic approach to bicultural practices. Te reo and tikanga Ma≈çri are visible and audible in the centre. Capability in this area is a strength of the current centre manager. Centre leaders now plan to develop stronger connections with community marae and iwi.</p><p>The centre has a well evaluated curriculum and well resourced learning areas. Older children are able to voice their own decision-making about their learning through play. They have good access to a range of resources, equipment and materials. Children benefit from periods where mixed-age groups can learn together in the outside environment. Centre leaders and teachers are developing ways to use children's contributions in programme planning.</p><p>There has been in-depth professional learning around children's development of dispositions for learning. This knowledge, developed alongside the family, is evident in children's portfolios and is a strong feature of current assessment practices in the centre.</p><p>Newly revised procedures for teacher appraisal have recently been introduced. Centre leaders and teachers make very good use of ongoing professional development programmes and this is now more evident in teachers' practice. Teachers are becoming increasingly reflective about improvements in their work in relation to best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>BestStart has recently developed a strategic plan to guide the organisation's future direction. Managers are working to increase coherence and alignment between organisational and individual centres' annual and strategic planning. The teacher appraisal process has been redeveloped with a focus on lifting teacher practice through individual inquiry. Managers will continue to provide targeted support to ensure these documents become familiar to teachers, and contribute to improved consistency in the quality of programmes across centres.</p><p>To support the provision of a broader curriculum in the outdoors, it would be worthwhile for BestStart managers and teachers to review and improve the design and layout of these learning environments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening 'teaching as inquiry' approaches as part of the appraisal system</li>
<li>incorporating family aspirations and feedback in the curriculum to reflect learning partnerships with parents.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Flatbush completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Flatbush will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>21 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
