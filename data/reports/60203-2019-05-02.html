</table><p>Pauatahanui Preschool Inc. is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pauatahanui Preschool is a community‚Äìbased centre in the grounds of Pauatahanui School. The¬†centre is licensed for 23 children from two years of age. There are four MƒÅori children enrolled.</p><p>The head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre. A parent management committee provides governance. The preschool employs a team of five qualified teachers. Since the June 2016 ERO review there have been some changes in staffing.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified areas requiring further development. These included assessment, planning and evaluation, integration of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and internal evaluation. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The centre is a member of the Porirua North KƒÅhui Ako|Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a playbased, language rich environment. They are empowered to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves and others. Regular routines provide a framework for the day. This supports children‚Äôs sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers know children and whƒÅnau well, and positive relationships are evident. They work alongside children, using a range of effective teaching strategies to support and extend their learning.</p><p>Children's contribution is encouraged and respected in curriculum design. Teachers provide opportunities for children to lead in a formal context and facilitate meaningful experiences to promote children's literacy skills.</p><p>The philosophy, in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau, should be reviewed to clearly identify what learning is valued at the preschool. Once completed, the next step will be to develop indicators of high quality practice that guide the implementation of the philosophy in action. These indictors can then be used to measure the effectiveness of the curriculum in action, through internal evaluation.</p><p>An increased focus by teachers on the integration of te reo MƒÅori throughout the curriculum is evident. Children understand the language used and respond appropriately. Aspects of tikanga MƒÅori are practiced and the MƒÅori values of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, kaitiakitanga are well integrated into the programme.</p><p>The preschool is beginning to develop a localised curriculum. Regular visits are to places of interest and significance to MƒÅori in the local community occur. This extends the programme provided. Leaders and teachers have initiated a relationship with the local iwi who have provided guidance in developing the teachers' understanding of working with MƒÅori in this area.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have identified that continuing to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of working with Pacific learners in a culturally responsive way is a next step. ERO¬†agrees with this direction.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and well supported in an inclusive environment. The preschool works closely with parents and external agencies to access the support required for these learners.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have strengthened their understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation practices. Recent developments in group planning have enhanced teachers' practice and documentation. Clearly identifying the learning outcomes at the beginning of the process should assist teachers to specifically identify strategies to support learners. Once enacted, teachers should evaluate the effectiveness of the plan and learning for children.</p><p>Regular entries in children‚Äôs portfolios show children‚Äôs engagement in the curriculum, their developing relationships and affirming parent comments. Continuing to build teachers' knowledge of assessment for learning should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more strongly reflecting the enactment of parents' aspirations for their child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning which shows how teachers will add depth and complexity to children's learning, which should assist in highlighting progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maximising opportunities to celebrate children‚Äôs culture, language and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Transitions into the preschool and onto school are thoughtfully planned and well managed. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively with the new entrant teachers from local schools to enable children to experience a positive transition into the school setting.</p><p>Annual appraisals support teachers' growth and development. This process should continue to be strengthened to include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clear and measurable goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a minimum of two targeted observations of teacher practice linked to teacher goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the appraisal policy and process should be updated to reflect all aspects of Teaching Council requirements.</p><p>Self review is regularly undertaken and leads to improved practice. A useful framework has been introduced to guide the process. Ongoing development is required to deepen teachers' understanding of using internal evaluation processes to judge the effectiveness of changes made on improving outcomes for children. Next steps to achieve this include teachers taking a more purposeful approach to identifying the evidence required to assist in answering the evaluative question posed.</p><p>The committee demonstrates a sound understanding of their governance roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Effective leadership shows a strong commitment to the ongoing improvement of teaching and learning that contributes to equitable outcomes for all children. The leader strongly advocates for parents and whƒÅnau, and their children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the centre philosophy, with parents and whƒÅnau, and develop success indicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop their understanding of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pauatahanui Preschool Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>2 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
