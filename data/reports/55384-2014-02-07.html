</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childspace Ltd-Northland is located in a residential area in a two-storey villa. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including 12 children aged up to two. The centre is designed for the different ages with the Tuakana group being located on the first floor and the Teina group on the second floor. It operates from 7.30am to 6.00pm, five days per week and has teacher-to-child ratios which exceed the minimum regulated requirements. The centre is influenced by a variety of philosophies and research, and relevant ideas and theories are reflected in practice and the environment.</p><p>Significant developments have occurred since the August 2010 ERO report. There have been changes to the teaching team, including a new centre manager. Ongoing developments have been made to the outside environment and gardens, with a newly build outdoor classroom.</p><p>This service is governed by the Childspace Institute (the Institute). This organisation offers the wider early childhood sector professional development, resources and equipment. The centre is serviced by the Childspace Workshop. It has a high commitment to maintaining 80% to 100% of qualified teachers and ongoing teacher education and professional development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews of Childspace Early Learning Centres under the Childspace Institute.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have positive, responsive and sensitive relationships with children. A key teacher approach is used to establish relationships with families. Teachers work well to identify children’s interests and ideas and use these to guide how they plan the programme. The use of the tuakana teina model to promote learning through peer interactions is valued by teachers and evident in practice, particularly with sibling relationships. There is a high level of trust in children and they are viewed as leaders. This promotes empowerment for children in their learning and environment.</p><p>The physical and natural environment is homely and allows ample opportunities for children to explore, wonder, create, investigate and problem-solve. Teachers encourage and support children to do this well by using a range of teaching strategies. Rituals and rhythms are integral to the programme and promote all children’s independence, sense of belonging and self regulation. Teachers respond to children's care needs in a respectful and gentle way. Care moments are highly valued by teachers.</p><p>Informal and formal opportunities for children to participate in literacy and numeracy experiences are evident. Leadership opportunities for children are fostered. Teachers interact and converse well with children using these times to prompt children to think and explore deeper understandings. Group times for children and a mentoring programme for older children provide experiences for them to support their transitions to school. Teachers have identified the need for continuous reflection on ways they can strengthen relationships with schools.</p><p>Settling-in processes for infants and toddlers are highly valued, well considered and responsive to the needs and routines of the child and their family. Teachers recognise the importance of consistency and continuity to support transitions into and throughout the centre. They maintain a calm, slow pace with infants and toddlers. Children are given space and time to lead their learning. Teachers offer infants and toddlers choices, respecting their competency to participate and contribute.</p><p>Kaupapa Māori concepts of manaakitanga and kotahitanga are highly evident in the centre. In-depth work has helped teachers to gain an understanding of these ideas and how they are reflected in practice. Teachers have identified that they would like to continue to develop their understandings and use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. EROs evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>The assessment process builds children’s identities as successful learners. This is used well to capture learning over time, show development and progress, and to plan. Opportunities for children to revisit their learning are provided. Formal six-monthly meetings with parents provide the opportunity to discuss children’s overall development. Including parents' aspirations discussed at the meetings in the child's portfolio would further show how parent input informs planning. Parents have regular opportunities to respond to children’s assessment and they contribute to these by adding comments and stories through an online assessment tool.</p><p>Leadership within the centre is promoted and encouraged, with many opportunities for all teachers to lead areas of the curriculum and centre operations.</p><p>Centre self-review processes are well developed and focused on quality improvement. Reviews provide opportunities for teachers to reflect on what they are doing. As a result, what is offered to children and families is improved and extended. Teachers are now ready to shift the focus of reviews from what they are doing to how well they are doing it. This shift should strengthen their reviews and better align with the intent of the Institute's process.</p><p>The principal, based at the Institute, is involved with the aspirations, learning programmes and developments within the centre and provides ongoing support to the teaching team. Leadership is a strength and well promoted. The appraisal system provides a clear process for staff. This is currently under review. There is a good quality of feedback from appraisers to promote growth in professional practices.</p><p>The Institute provides a high level of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust policies and procedures developed in consultation with teachers and parents</li>
<li>well-considered assessment and planning frameworks</li>
<li>clear processes and expectations for continuous review</li>
<li>professional learning and leadership opportunities for staff.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management plans clearly link to the Institute’s strategic plan. There is a focus on improvement through reflection, review and professional development. Many opportunities for teachers to further their education are provided.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and the principal have outlined in an action plan the priority areas for further development. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>shift the focus of self review from what teachers are doing, to how well they are doing it</li>
<li>continue to strengthen transition-to-school processes with a particular focus on strengthening relationships with schools</li>
<li>develop shared understandings with Māori whānau for success for Maori children as Māori, so teachers can measure the effectiveness of their practice.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation affirms these priorities to further enhance teaching practice and outcomes for children and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childspace Ltd-Northland completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childspace Ltd-Northland will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>7 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
