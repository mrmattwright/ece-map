</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oratia Kindergarten, in Oratia, provides early childhood education for up to 40 children from two years old to school age. The kindergarten has very recently changed to the kindergarten day model (KDM), which enables children to attend sessions that match school hours.</p><p>The long-serving teaching team consists of four fully qualified teachers. The head teacher manages the daily operations of the centre and confidently leads the team to provide a quality programme for children.</p><p>The kindergarten is situated within the Oratia Primary school grounds and has strong links with the school community. There is a strong focus on fostering long-term relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. The centre philosophy promotes a bicultural curriculum and reciprocal and respectful relationships. The strands and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, underpin the programme provided for children.</p><p>Oratia Kindergarten is well established and has a history of positive ERO reporting. There has been a good response to the recommendations in ERO‚Äôs 2011 report and improvements continue to be a focus. The programme provides opportunities for children to inquire and explore. Varied literacy, numeracy, science and art activities are also provided for children to experience. The outdoor environment reflects the centre‚Äôs commitment to promoting a sustainable and natural environment.</p><p>Oratia Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have fun and are enthusiastic about their experiences in the kindergarten. They are settled, confident and friendly and interact well with their peers and teachers. They are curious and enjoy exploring the different learning environments, making choices and engaging in a range of activities.</p><p>Teachers promote children‚Äôs dispositions to strengthen learning. They are trialling different ways to plan programmes to better respond to and cater for children‚Äôs interests. Teachers are strengthening their reflections and use of parent and community feedback to provide a more inclusive programme.</p><p>Teachers are confident and work collaboratively to respond to children‚Äôs interest and curiosity. They provide good opportunities for children to explore. They use open ended questions to promote conversations with children and to deepen their thinking. Teachers are increasing their knowledge of Te Ao MƒÅori and are focused on promoting partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The kindergarten has a well developed transition to school programme and has established strong links with Oratia Primary School. Kindergarten staff take advantage of the many opportunities for children to be involved in school events, which contributes to children‚Äôs confidence and readiness for a successful start to compulsory schooling.</p><p>Teachers have good knowledge of children‚Äôs learning progress. They are currently trialling new ways to record individual children‚Äôs interests and use observations to plan learning programmes. These records include information about parent and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children. Teachers are now consolidating programme planning practices that are proving effective. They are also embedding professional learning to further promote children‚Äôs language, culture and identity within the programme. Work in this area continues to be an ongoing focus for teachers.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association has good systems for self review and accountability to guide kindergarten management, and it continues to provide effective governance for kindergartens. The AKA has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to implementing strategies that support kindergartens in promoting positive outcomes for all children. The association is currently reviewing the appraisal process used in all its kindergartens.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that key next steps for the kindergarten should include:</p><ul>
<li>promoting MƒÅori knowledge, language and cultural values in the programme</li>
<li>developing meaningful and relevant learning partnerships between parents/whƒÅnau and teachers</li>
<li>strengthening the use of assessment and evaluation in curriculum planning</li>
<li>formalising a robust and well documented self-review process that includes parents and whƒÅnau contribution.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oratia Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Oratia Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
