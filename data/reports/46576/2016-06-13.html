</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Millie's House is an early childhood service in Central Lower Hutt licensed for 100 children, including 24 up to the age of two. At the time of this review there were 86 children on the roll and 12 are MƒÅori. The centre opened in November 2014. The service is continuing to grow in size.</p><p>A new centre manager, who started in January 2016, has been instrumental in restructuring the centre. Since her arrival team leaders have been designated for each of the five classrooms. Of the twenty teachers employed, six are provisionally registered.</p><p>An external facilitator is providing a range of staff professional development including team building, and planning and assessment.</p><p>This is the service's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teaching practices are nurturing and provide children with a sense of belonging. Children are confident with routines and actively engage with activities. Teachers offer choices and support children to develop their self-help skills and to be independent. Positive interactions are evident in extending some children's learning.</p><p>The new centre manager has appropriately identified key priorities for centre development and is sequentially addressing these. Many of the services systems and processes are newly established and recently implemented. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a new centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a consistent centre approach to curriculum planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a process for teacher appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beginning to renew centre resources and equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional development focusing on building a cohesive team and supporting teachers' confidence and consistency in practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating new employment agreements and job descriptions, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic plan, annual plan and action plan to address priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre management is aware of the need for ongoing improvement to provide children with high quality early childhood learning.</p><p>Strengthening curriculum opportunities for children is a key next step. This development includes: reflecting the philosophy in action; clarifying expectations for teaching; responding to parent aspirations; and enhancing culturally responsive learning. Staff should begin to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting positive learning outcomes for children through this development.</p><p>Inclusive practices are at early stages of development. Children with additional needs have recently been identified. Creating individual development plans, in conjunction with families and appropriate support personnel, is a next step.</p><p>Appropriate centre guidelines are in place to support the newly developed assessment, planning and evaluation systems. Profile books show children's exploration and involvement in activities. Some learning stories indicate how teachers plan to extend children's learning. To further enhance planning and add complexity to learning, greater consistency is needed in assessment practice. Ongoing teacher development should assist with monitoring, so that assessment, planning and professional evaluation practices continue to improve.</p><p>Appraisal systems require further development. These should include: centre leadership; observations; teaching as inquiry; feedback for improvement; and greater alignment with the Practising Teacher Criteria. Establishing an appropriate induction and mentoring programme for provisionally certified teachers is a high priority.</p><p>As the service continues to grow in size, managers should ensure that there is appropriate provision of suitable resources in relation to children's interests and age-specific needs. They plan to do an audit of resources to identify budget priorities.</p><p>Some teachers deliberately use te reo MƒÅori. However, bicultural practices require improvement. Staff undertaking internal evaluation of practice in the preschool rooms are considering how kaupapa MƒÅori is integrated in the programme. Understandings of biculturalism and how to support MƒÅori children achieve success needs development. Using <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> should assist teachers to continue to grow in this area.</p><p>Systems and processes require improvement to guide centre development at all levels and to ensure high quality, consistent and sustainable operation and practices. There is a need to review policies and procedures to align with current legislation. During the on-site phase of ERO's education review, the necessary child protection policy and attendant procedures were developed.</p><p>Internal evaluation is in the early stages of development. Understandings and practices need to improve so that staff can evaluate the effectiveness of centre curriculum, systems and processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly establish curriculum priorities linked to the philosophy of Millie's House</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue professional development in planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance and fully implement appraisal to build teacher capability and effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop clear systems and processes at all levels to ensure high quality, consistent and sustainable operation and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop shared understandings and use of internal evaluation for ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Millie's House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the early childhood service management should ensure that there is a clear cycle of police vetting.<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Millie's House will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
