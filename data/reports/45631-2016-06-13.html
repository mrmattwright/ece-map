</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunshine Childcare on Vickery is an all-day education and care centre located in the Hamilton suburb of Te Rapa. It is one of two centres that are privately owned by the same service providers. It operates two age-group areas to cater for the diverse needs of infants, toddlers and young children up to school age. The centre is licensed for a maximum of 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Currently there are 50 children enrolled of whom 15 are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The owners retain responsibility for governance matters including strategic planning, as well as property, finance, and employment management. One of the owners, who is a qualified teacher, works with the centre manager to provide professional leadership. A recently appointed team leader supports the centre manager in overseeing daily operations. The centre retains a high proportion of qualified staff.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is to empower children as life-long learners, with a sense of belonging and the ability to explore the world around them. Children are to be supported to lead their own learning. The mission statement is 'real wonder, real adventure and real engagement'.</p><p>Centre leadership responded positively to recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. Self-review and appraisal processes have been strengthen and extended. Professional development and leadership opportunities for staff have been increased.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are warmly welcomed into the centre, where they experience close, trusting and respectful relationships with teachers. Parents are supported to be partners in their child's learning journey and encouraged to share home experiences, family histories and cultural backgrounds. This partnership helps children to settle quickly into the centre's homely environment, where they develop a strong sense of belonging. Teachers are responsive to children's social, emotional and physical needs. Centre staff are successful in supporting children with additional learning or developmental requirements.</p><p>Bicultural practices are naturally integrated into centre operations. MƒÅori teachers are an effective resource to support the increasing confidence and competence of all staff in the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Whanaungatanga values underpin the centre culture, which also recognises and values each child's whakapapa and whƒÅnau. Close links between the age-group areas promotes tuakana-teina relationships where children have a role in supporting the learning and wellbeing of others.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from personalised routines where home experiences are shared by parents to support teachers in responding to their child's individual care needs. They have close attachments to teachers who skilfully tune into their ways of communicating. A particular strength of the programme is the rich experiences infants and toddlers have that supports their language development and communication skills.</p><p>Teachers are knowledgeable about <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They use observations and shared knowledge to notice and recognise individual children's interests and strengths. They plan to respond to these interests and support learning through play experiences. Teachers engage children in conversations and encourage oral language skills. Familiar routines support children's social and self-help skills.</p><p>Children benefit from extended periods of uninterrupted play. The outside play areas provide many opportunities for physical challenge, exploration and interaction with the natural world. While the centre is well resourced, centre leaders recognise the need to increase children's ability to access resources and equipment, especially in the over-two area.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are sensitively managed by teachers who take into account the child's emotional wellbeing and parent aspirations. A recent development has been the use of separate illustrated record of transitions to record and share the process with families/whƒÅnau. Centre staff are currently reviewing the philosophy and operation of the 'transformer' programme, which is intended to prepare children for transition to school.</p><p>Child assessment portfolios celebrate children's successes in their learning. These documents capture the child's personality and ways they approach learning. Portfolios are shared with families who feel well informed about their child's time at the centre. Parents are invited to contribute and share the aspirations they have for their child's learning.</p><p>The centre owner and management demonstrate a commitment to equitable learning opportunities, where children and their families are at the forefront of decision making. Centre leadership is generous and pro-active in addressing any possible barriers to children's participation at the centre. The centre manager provides effective leadership and is working closely with the owners to build a collaborative team culture among staff. She provides teachers with regular feedback and professional guidance. Teachers respond positively to the high expectations set, regularly reflect on their practice and contribute to effective self-review processes in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The service providers and staff recognise that the review and development of the learning environments in the over-two play areas is a strategic priority. Increasing the ongoing access for children to a full range of equipment is likely to support the centre's philosophy to encourage them to lead their own learning through play.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunshine Childcare on Vickery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunshine Childcare on Vickery will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>13 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
