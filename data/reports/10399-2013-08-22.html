<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Tausa'afia Trust governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the June 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and programme implementation, including the quality of extending children&rsquo;s learning, the integration of literacy, numeracy and bicultural learning</li>
<li>management expectations, operation and administration, good employment and some health and safety procedures</li>
<li>self-review practices</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the governance, management and operation of the centre that arise during the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The Tausa&rsquo;afia Trust aoga amata was established in 2008 under the auspices of the Fa&rsquo;ata&rsquo;ita&rsquo;i Samoa Pacific Island Church Mangere. The Tausa&rsquo;afia Trust philosophy is based on Christian principles and Samoan language and culture. Located on the church grounds, the centre is part of a large complex that also accommodates separate facilities for Niue and Cook Island preschools. Each centre contributes to the overall maintenance of the shared building. In 2011 the Trust board appointed a new centre manager and a new supervisor joined the staff in 2013. These changes have contributed to improved centre operations.</p><p>Tausa&rsquo;afia Trust has made significant progress over the past 12 months. Staff have created a family atmosphere that warmly welcomes children and parents. They work collaboratively to promote children&rsquo;s well being and social development. Areas for review and development identified in the June 2012 ERO report have been prioritised by the board and centre manager in strategic planning and self review.</p><p>Staff are participating in professional development focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning. The centre manager and supervisor are building staff capacity to reflect on their own practices and to share teaching strategies that promote children&rsquo;s learning effectively. An external training provider and the trust board are providing support for this work.</p><p>Children are exposed to a language rich environment that promotes their understanding and use of the Samoan language throughout all aspects of the learning programme. Children are confident. They enjoy the variety of activities available to them and are well supported by staff. Children are acknowledged for their efforts and ideas and interact well with each other and adults.</p><p>The recent appointment of a supervisor and external adviser is helping new and longstanding staff to refocus the centre&rsquo;s direction so that they can work towards providing high quality education in a professional, collaborative working environment.</p><h3>Assessment, planning and programme implementation</h3><p>Areas of progress</p><p>The centre has made positive progress in curriculum management. This is helping to provide an overview of the quality of teaching and learning. Improvement has been made possible by:</p><ul>
<li>the recent appointment of a supervisor which has resulted in clearer lines of accountability between the staff, centre manager and the board</li>
<li>increasing staff understanding about expectations for programme planning, assessment and evaluation and about their roles and responsibilities in the aoga</li>
<li>the re-establishment of positive relationships and a professional culture amongst staff</li>
<li>regular staff discussions focused on improving teaching practices and the learning programme for children</li>
<li>increased integration of literacy and numeracy learning experiences in children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>increased integration of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>These improvements are having a positive impact on children. ERO&rsquo;s findings show that children are interested and engaged in centre activities. They are developing good social skills and are well supported by teachers. Children benefit from increasingly positive learning experiences, with managers and teachers acknowledging the need for continuing development of their assessment, planning and programme implementation practices.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>Assessment, planning and programme implementation could now be improved further by:</p><ul>
<li>a continued focus on staff extending children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>staff engaging in ongoing individual and whole group evaluations of the programme</li>
<li>the board providing additional non-contact time for staff to accelerate improved practice</li>
<li>the centre manager, supervisor and staff continuing to explore ways to increase children&rsquo;s bicultural experiences.</li>
</ul><h3>Management expectations, operation and administration, good employment, health and safety procedures</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The centre has made progress in all areas of management identified as needing further development in the June 2012 ERO report. Practices that have supported this improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>the implementation of improved management systems, including those for record keeping and policy review</li>
<li>discussions about and documentation of staff performance appraisal, and opportunities for staff to set individual goals</li>
<li>the appointment of an external advisor to assist the board and staff and to support the centre&rsquo;s strategic direction.</li>
</ul><p>All health and safety issues identified in the ERO June 2012 report have been addressed. The centre environment promotes children&rsquo;s learning and staff are more aware of policies and practice requirements.</p><p>Since the June 2012 report the board and manager have improved self-review processes by:</p><ul>
<li>linking self review to long-term strategic planning and increasing understandings about what self review means for the centre</li>
<li>increasing discussions and processes for gathering information about ways to improve the centre from the board, staff and parents</li>
<li>clarifying and improving reporting lines between the board, manager, supervisor, staff and parents so that the centre&rsquo;s community is well informed about, and able to contribute to, ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><p>Evidence of improved practice can also be seen in work done to document progress against ERO recommendations and the centre&rsquo;s strategic goals.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>The centre manager and supervisor agree with ERO that they could further improve self review and that this should be a priority in all centres' planning. Staff appraisals could also be enhanced by providing clear explanations about how staff can further improve their practice.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tausa'afia Trust will be in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>22 August 2013</p><a id="3-information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Information about the Service</h2><table>
