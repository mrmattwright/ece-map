</table><p>Newlands Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Newlands Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 41 children. Of the 56 children enrolled, six identify as MƒÅori and seven as having Pacific heritage. Daily sessions are for mixed ages from two to school age.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of providing an inspiring, fun and creative setting, <span lang="mi">manaakitanga</span>, celebrating diversity, valuing whƒÅnau contributions and upholding <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></p><p>Since the June 2015 ERO report, a new head teacher has been appointed who is responsible for managing the day-to-day operation of the kindergarten. All teachers are fully qualified. Developments of the indoor and the outdoor learning areas have also been undertaken.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed and managed by <span lang="mi">He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua</span> Kindergarten Association (the association). A team of senior teachers oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The association governs 102 kindergartens which includes three Pacific kindergartens and a Pacific home-based service with two networks.</p><p>ERO's June 2015 report identified areas requiring further development. These included: strengthening assessment and programme planning processes; supporting children with additional learning needs; integrating success for MƒÅori and reflecting children's ethnicities in the curriculum; strengthening leadership; and developing teachers understanding and use of self review. Good progress has been made to address these areas.</p><p>Progress has been made by the association to improve the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p><p>This review was one of eight in <span lang="mi">He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua</span> Kindergarten Association, Wellington region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play freely in a calm and well-paced play-based programme. Learning spaces are organised to encourage investigation and creativity. The outdoor environment includes a wide range of physical resources that invite exploration and challenge. Teachers effectively use a range of intentional strategies to support children‚Äôs learning. Consistently implemented routine times gives children a sense of security.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and effectively planned for in the programme. Teachers work collaboratively with whƒÅnau and external agencies to identify and reduce barriers to learning.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy was developed collaboratively by leaders, teachers, parents and whƒÅnau. It reflects a commitment to celebrating diversity and the bicultural heritage of <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span>. It also defines what educational success means for the kindergarten and its community. This detail will be useful for teachers to evaluate how well practices support the service to meet these values, beliefs and aspirations.</p><p>Teachers continue to increase their knowledge, understanding and implementation of <span lang="mi">te ao MƒÅori</span> perspectives. <span lang="mi">Kaupapa MƒÅori</span> values guide the bicultural programme. <span lang="mi">Te reo and waiata MƒÅori</span> are used in meaningful ways to enrich children‚Äôs learning. Leaders and teachers are continuing to investigate how they can weave places of significant value to MƒÅori and their community into the curriculum as a next step.</p><p>The languages and symbols of children's backgrounds including Pacific artefacts, are highly evident in the learning environment. Celebrating annual cultural events further extends the programme for these children.</p><p>Teachers use an effective planning for learning framework to guide practice. Group and individual children‚Äôs emerging interests and whƒÅnau aspirations inform the programme. Teachers seek to recognise what is important by providing purposeful experiences. Children‚Äôs profile books record their individual learning, developing friendships and participation in the programme. Assessing how teachers add complexity to children's learning and capturing this in documentation continues to be a focus for the teaching team.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective and improvement focused. They continue to build knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation so they can measure the impact of their practice on outcomes for children. Systems and processes have been well developed to guide teacher‚Äôs capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>A well-considered appraisal process has recently been enhanced to grow and develop teacher practice. Teachers are expected to inquire into the effectiveness of their teaching. Purposeful appraisal goals focus on improving aspects of leadership and practice to support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Senior leaders work effectively together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. They successfully foster collective sense of responsibility to implement the vision, values and mission of the association. Well-considered resource allocation supports and enhances children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The association provides good support, professional learning and development to build the leadership capabilities of the head teacher and the teaching team. They have established a culture in which children and their whƒÅnau are valued and celebrated for who they are.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>integrate places of significant value to MƒÅori and their community into the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance assessment for learning documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build the teaching teams internal evaluation capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and senior leaders agree that the association's next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to follow the strategic direction set through <span lang="mi">T≈´manako, Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> based Strategic Priority Framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Newlands Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>10 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
