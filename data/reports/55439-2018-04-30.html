</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childspace Ngaio is an all-day education and care service, comprised of two side-by-side villas. It is licensed for 61 children, including up to 25 aged up to two years. The service is one of four in the area that are governed by a board of directors with considerable knowledge and expertise in early childhood education and environment design.</p><p>Staff (kaiako), learning spaces and resources are divided into four flexible, age-related groups. Children of different ages often spend time together. A centre manager oversees the curriculum, staff and day-to-day operation. The governance group employs a principal to offer further professional and operational support. They also provide professional development and resources to others in the early childhood sector. A kai creator is employed to provide nutritious meals for the children. Childspace is committed to gender balance in its staffing, and employs a number of male kaiako.</p><p>Relationships are core to the service philosophy. Group projects and investigations are central to the group programme for older children. Kaiako focus on resourcing the environment, with particular attention paid to natural materials, rituals and real-life experiences. Teaching practices are underpinned by the Pikler approach and Resources of Infant Educarers (RIE) philosophy, emphasising respectful practice and close attachments with key kaiako.</p><p>Next steps identified in the service‚Äôs February 2014 ERO report have been progressed. This includes collaboration between the two villas and transition to school processes and relationships. However, cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori remains an area requiring development.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of four reviews of the Childspace Early Learning Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm and respectful interactions. They freely access a good range of open-ended and sensory-rich learning materials linked to their own interests, for the majority of the day, and confidently participate in rituals.</p><p>The daily programme reflects ngƒÅ kaiako commitment to their philosophical values. They work alongside children at their level and support their oral language through attentive conversations. Kaiako are skilful in their use of the environment as a learning tool. Spaces and resources are thoughtfully arranged to offer children opportunities for inspiration, exploration, contemplation, challenge and discovery. Children have many opportunities to engage in tuakana-teina interactions with their older and younger peers.</p><p>Group projects and investigations are supportive of children‚Äôs interests and offer valuable new experiences. A strength of the programme is the emphasis on sustainability and the natural world.</p><p>Kaiako liaise with parents and outside agencies, as appropriate, to support the learning and wellbeing of children with diverse learning needs.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are respected as competent individuals. They benefit from closely attuned relationships with kaiako. Families are welcomed and consulted to develop individualised care programmes. Care rituals are maximised as valuable relationship-building opportunities. Interactions are warm, calm and peaceful. Kaiako are responsive to children‚Äôs personal rhythms and cues. Indoor and outdoor learning areas are spacious, and have been purposefully designed to support free movement and self-determined active exploration.</p><p>Positive relationships with parents are prioritised. Kaiako provide a range of opportunities for families to engage in their child‚Äôs learning programme, including regular workshops and parent-teacher discussion evenings where families' aspirations are shared. An online assessment tool is used to invite parent comments and strengthen connections between home and centre.</p><p>As a next step, kaiako should clearly demonstrate in documentation how their close relationships with families enrich their planning and assessment documentation. This would mean stronger acknowledgement of parent aspirations as well as children‚Äôs culture, language and identity.</p><p>Teachers are sensitive observers. They document useful information about children‚Äôs individual interests, skills and development, as well as their engagement in the rich group curriculum. Portfolios show that teachers know children well. They thoughtfully relate observations to a range of theoretical lenses. Documentation shows clear links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017,</em> the early childhood education curriculum.</p><p>However, the impact of targeted teaching on individual children‚Äôs learning outcomes is not clear in documentation. Assessment and planning requires strengthening, to better show and build children‚Äôs identities as successful, continual learners.</p><p>Transitions into, through and out of the two villas are very well considered. A focus on continuity of care, where key teachers move through transitions alongside children, promotes children‚Äôs sense of security, confidence and wellbeing. Management provides an additional kaiako across the Childspace services to assist during transition periods. The centre has developed effective relationships with local schools.</p><p>Kaiako have been building their knowledge of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. The centre‚Äôs sustainability focus, excursions into the surrounding community, and explorations into native bush, are usefully linked to bicultural perspectives. Teachers demonstrate authenticity in their commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The programme affirms all children‚Äôs identities as bicultural citizens of Aotearoa.</p><p>Leaders agree their next step is to build on this knowledge to explore and implement specific strategies for promoting the educational success of MƒÅori learners. This is indicated in future plans.</p><p>Teaching teams collaborate on useful investigations to inform change and improve the programme. They consult with relevant stakeholders and research. A next step is to build review practices which are strongly evaluative. Leaders should support kaiako to use systematic, robust evidence-gathering to inform refinement of practices. Internal evaluations should clearly measure and monitor the impact of practices against intended outcomes for children.</p><p>Systematic processes for biannual appraisal are in place. Kaiako are highly reflective. Observations of teaching practice are part of this process. To support an improved approach these observations and other evidence should consistently inform more robust feedback and feed forward, strongly focused on children‚Äôs learning outcomes and alignment with centre goals.</p><p>Strategic planning identifies useful goals that are likely to positively affect children‚Äôs outcomes. To strengthen long-term planning, clear indicators of success should be developed, linked to each goal, to enable ongoing measurement of progress and inform actions. Since the onsite stage of ERO's evaluation, clear indicators of success have been developed that should support an improved process.</p><p>Childspace kaiako are well supported by management. A range of useful documents and resources are in place to support shared understandings. The Institute offers many opportunities for kaiako to network and take on leadership roles, in the centre as well as in the wider sector. Leaders purposefully and consistently promote team cohesion and a positive culture.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The intended goals, strategies and outcomes identified in the revised and updated 2018-2023 Childspace Strategic Plan outline the service's intended next steps in relation to the need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the focus on measurement and monitoring of the impact of practices on children's outcomes through internal evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individualised assessment and planning processes, particularly in relation to building children's identities as ongoing learners, and responding to children's cultural contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all teachers' understanding and implementation of targeted strategies for the promotion of educational success for MƒÅori learners.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childspace Ngaio completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, management should strengthen its monitoring of quality assurance processes to ensure the service consistently meets the requirements of <em>Licensing Criteria for Education and Care Services 2008</em> and the <em>Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.</em>Since the onsite phase of the review management has taken steps to address this.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childspace Ngaio will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>30 April 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
