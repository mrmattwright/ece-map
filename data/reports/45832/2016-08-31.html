</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Small Pukeko‚Äôs Early Learning Centre is a privately owned centre formerly known as Small Poppies Kaiwaka. The service provides full day education and care for up to 53 children including up to 17 under two years old. Both age groups have separate play areas but mobile toddlers often join the older children in the larger play areas. Most children on the roll are PƒÅkehƒÅ or European. There is also a small group of MƒÅori children who are well supported to be proud of their cultural identity.</p><p>The centre came under new ownership in July 2015, but teaching staff remained unchanged. The owners delegate the daily management of the centre to the supervisor and a head teacher. The owners visit frequently to foster improvements in the quality of teaching and learning, help with administration and monitor centre operations. They are committed to the ongoing professional development of staff and supporting them to provide effective learning experiences for children. Both owners and four staff are registered teachers.</p><p>In 2013 ERO identified several positive features of the service. Respectful teaching practices enabled children to feel confident in a caring environment and the outdoor area supported children's physical play well. These remain strengths of the centre. Teachers continue to work on programme planning and evaluation, and self-review processes which ERO identified as areas for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships and a strong sense of family underpin the welcoming centre environment. Children arrive eager to greet teachers and connect with their friends. They are confident, self-directed learners who respond well to teachers who skilfully support their interests. Children work effectively in small groups, often solving problems, persisting with difficult tasks or creating imaginative scenarios together. They contribute well in conversations about their learning and often use early maths, science and literacy skills in meaningful contexts. They are also familiar with karakia and waiata and are supported, particularly by a teacher fluent in te reo MƒÅori, to have a growing vocabulary in MƒÅori.</p><p>The small group of children under two-years old enjoy a spacious environment with easy access to resources that support their learning and development. They are confident and playful in the care of calm and responsive teachers. Toddlers also benefit from a newly upgraded outdoor area that supports their physical play.</p><p>Teachers actively encourage children to extend their learning. They ask open-ended questions that prompt children to negotiate and explore new ideas for play. Teachers expect children to work cooperatively, sustain meaningful play and show respect for each other. They provide a specific school readiness programme for four-year olds that children enjoy. While play is a feature of this programme, teachers should ensure that the more formal aspects are meaningful for children and link to the overall programme. Teachers have established an inviting environment that provides many interesting play areas and opportunities for physical play outdoors.</p><p>Programmes are based on projects that reflect children's interests. Teachers are successfully deepening their knowledge of children through these ongoing topics and helping them to explore complex ideas. Project books that result from activities support children to revisit their learning and inform families about the programme. Teachers record children's learning well, but have identified the need to improve consistency in the assessment portfolios. They also recognise that it would be worthwhile to formally document their planning so that they can evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.</p><p>Parents are valued partners in the centre. They are kept well informed about their child‚Äôs learning, are consulted through surveys and are invited to share children's home experiences. Parents make good use of a digital portal to access their child‚Äôs learning stories and some are now providing feedback for teachers. Many also participate in cultural celebrations and centre events. Parents who were interviewed by ERO appreciate the relationships their children share with teachers and the daily update of information on a closed social media site. Centre leaders are committed to providing well for families and maintaining strong links with their community.</p><p>The owners lead the centre well. While they still have several management and personnel systems to refine, they are conscientiously working to streamline the centre‚Äôs operation. They have clearly defined management and leadership roles and responsibilities and include staff in decision making. They have begun to establish a culture of internal evaluation but recognise this as an area for further development. The owners strongly support the ongoing professional development of staff and provide leadership opportunities to support their professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>redeveloping the long-term strategic plan and annual planning processes to ensure these align and provide guidance for achieving strategic goals</li>
<li>refining and implementing the new staff appraisal process</li>
<li>documenting programme planning to clarify intended learning outcomes and to provide the basis for programme evaluations.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the owners should check with Education New Zealand to ensure that the upstairs room used for the four-year olds‚Äô programme is licensed for children's use.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Small Pukeko's Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Small Pukeko's Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>31 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
