</table><p>With Gisborne Kindergarten Association support, and the development of an action plan, this kindergarten is well placed to bring about necessary improvements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangapapa Kindergarten is adjacent to Mangapapa School in Gisborne. It opens from 8:30am to 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 8:30am to 12:45pm on Friday. The service is licensed for up to 40 children aged from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review, 17 children identify as Māori.</p><p>A head teacher oversees the day to day operation of the centre. All teachers are fully qualified and are supported by a teacher aide. There have been some changes in the teaching team including a new head teacher since the August 2014 ERO review.</p><p>Over the past three years staff have participated in professional development provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) which has included learning about te ao Māori, working with younger children, and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Mangapapa Kindergarten is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the association. Two senior teachers provide professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed-term contract to guide kindergartens implementation of tikanga and kaupapa Māori practices.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development at kindergarten level, including: philosophy, assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning, bicultural programme and internal evaluation. Some progress has been made in addressing these areas for improvement. At the association level, it was identified that they should undertake strategic self review. Progress is ongoing.<strong></strong></p><p>This review is part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The recently reviewed centre philosophy underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, has resulted in a more child-centred focus. Teachers have begun to explore what this looks like for children.</p><p>Children are able to lead their own learning. They confidently engage in the programme. A range of learning experiences and resources is provided by teachers, who work alongside children to support their independence, exploration and social competencies. Teachers need to more consistently interact with children in ways that add challenge and complexity to their learning.</p><p>Teachers engage with families and external agencies to support children who require additional learning support. Learning spaces are carefully designed to minimise potential barriers to learning.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning requires strengthening. Profile book information shows children's participation and engagement in the programme. Teachers need to develop a shared understanding of expectations of what effective assessment looks like to show:</p><ul>
<li>planning and intentional teaching for individuals</li>
<li>how learning is progressed over time</li>
<li>connections to children's culture, language and identity</li>
<li>responsiveness to parent aspirations and perspectives.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team is committed to the development of the bicultural programme. They are beginning to consider how the curriculum can reflect a Māori world view. Leaders and teachers should continue to use te reo Māori with children and be proactive in their approach to integrating te ao Māori throughout the curriculum and supporting documentation.</p><p>The service engages in meaningful relationships with many of the families. Leaders and teachers recognise the importance of strong relationships for the development of successful learning partnerships with Māori families to promote Māori children's success.</p><p>Regular reviews are undertaken to support decision making. Understanding of internal evaluation is not yet evident. Leaders and ERO agree that developing collaborative understanding and use of evaluation is needed to help determine what the centre priorities are for taking action to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Leadership is focussed on building teacher capability and collaborative ways of working. There is a clear commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system should strengthen teachers' inquiries into their own practice.<b></b></p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty-based partnerships and acknowledging Māori as tangata whenua. The association has identified that developing shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen teacher understanding and implementation of high quality practice which responds to children's needs and interests</li>
<li>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning to inform and enhance the programme</li>
<li>strengthen educational success for Māori children.<strong></strong></li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>fully implement the new appraisal system</li>
<li>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels of the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Mangapapa Kindergarten will develop an action plan that details how they plan to address these priorities. Progress against this plan will be monitored by ERO.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangapapa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b> </b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mangapapa Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>11 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
