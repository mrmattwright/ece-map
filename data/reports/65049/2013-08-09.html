</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scenicland Limited administers four early childhood centres on the West Coast. Three centres are in Greymouth and the fourth centre is in Hokitika. Scenicland Pre School and Nursery in Cobden caters for children in three separate groups. The nursery, toddler and preschool areas each have their own separate, well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>The manager is highly committed to employing qualified early childhood teachers and supporting staff members to gain an early childhood teacher qualification. The centre meets the minimum requirements for qualified early childhood teachers. A major contributing factor in attracting and keeping qualified staff is the centre‚Äôs location on the West Coast.</p><p>The manager, head teacher and staff have made significant progress in improving the quality of education since the 2010 ERO review. Self review is now well established and used to improve learning and teaching. An improved management system and practices are being put in place. Good use is made of professional development to support improvements to governance, management, and teaching and learning. A high level of health and safety is maintained for children, staff and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a caring and responsive environment. They have positive relationships with their teachers and each other. Teachers use a range of appropriate ways to help children develop good social skills and to respect and include others.</p><p>Infants in the nursery benefit from positive, sensitive and responsive interactions with their teachers. Teachers are consistent in their approaches while remaining flexible and responsive to the infants and toddlers. Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace that enables infants and toddlers to be active explorers and confident in the nursery. Profile books keep parents well informed about their infant‚Äôs development at the centre. The stories capture special moments and provide parents with a detailed record of their child settling, gaining confidence and trying new things.</p><p>Teachers show a high level of commitment to te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and continue to develop their skills and knowledge. Self review, professional development and discussion at staff meetings are well used to support staff in using te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. The opinions of parents of MƒÅori children are sought. Teachers continually reflect on how they can strengthen partnerships with MƒÅori families to recognise their culture and identify.</p><p>Some teachers use a good range of practices to support children and their learning. They listen carefully, ask questions, provide explanations and encourage children to think about a range of possibilities. Children are provided with good feedback on their learning that acknowledges their effort and success.</p><p>The separate learning environments for infants, toddlers and preschoolers are spacious and well resourced. A feature of these areas is the wide range of equipment to encourage the development of physical skills and confidence.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers are developing a good format for assessment and planning. Child assessments provide some good examples of children‚Äôs learning, including ways teachers support this learning. Teachers sometimes identify possible next steps for learning and recognise the culture and identity of MƒÅori children.</p><p>The four-year-old programme is carefully focused on the needs of individual children in their preparation for school. The teacher responsible takes particular care to make sure the programme builds on children‚Äôs interests and confidence, and that the children are active thinkers and participants.</p><p>Self review is well established and useful. Teachers have a good understanding of review and value their involvement in the process. Investigative questions are well defined. Teachers gather information from a range of sources and analyse it well. Action plans give clear direction for making improvement to the quality of learning for children. The plans are regularly monitored to ensure the expected improvements occur.</p><p>The manager, head teacher and teachers work well together. The manager and head teacher value and support ongoing professional development for themselves and the teachers. The head teacher knows the strengths of individual teachers and makes use of these strengths to benefit the team and improve learning and teaching.</p><p>The manager and head teachers from the four centres, with support of advisors, have put together a strategic plan that provides direction for the future development of the centre and improving teaching and learning. The plan has clear objectives that cover learning and teaching and building capability and capacity within the organisation and staff. The plan makes particular reference to increasing the focus on New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage so that all children gain appropriate knowledge and experience success in this area.</p><p>The manager is committed to growing the leadership capabilities of her head teachers and staff. She is investing significantly in their ongoing professional development and involving them in major decisions for the organisation. The head teachers from the four centres told ERO that they value the opportunity to share experiences and expertise with each other and the manager on a regular basis.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and head teacher have identified and ERO agrees that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>extending self review to evaluate how well the goals of the long-term plans for the organisation and individual centres are being met</li>
<li>continuing to use and refine the new approach to programme planning</li>
<li>continuing to develop and review the effectiveness of the newly developed appraisal system</li>
<li>Investigating further ways to build learning partnerships with parents, particularly families of MƒÅori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scenicland Pre School and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scenicland Pre School and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>9 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
