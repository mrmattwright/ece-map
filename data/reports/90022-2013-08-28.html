</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Toi Tois Playcentre is one of 19 centres governed by the Southland Playcentre Association (SPA.) It is located in the small, rural settlement of Tokanui and is the only early childhood service in the area. It provides two morning sessions for up to 25 children aged from birth to six years. Currently about 16 children attend. There are close links with the local school which help children make smooth transitions when they start school.</p><p>Many families travel some distance to attend and stay for the duration of the session with their children. Some of the parents have several years of association with the centre. Good numbers of parents are working through the playcentre training. A dedicated, long-serving educator takes responsibility for the overall running of the sessions.</p><p>The centre parents have responded positively to the recommendations from the last ERO review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 17 reviews in the SPA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from very secure relationships with the adults in the playcentre. They confidently interact with all the adults in the session. They know each other well and are developing their friendships. A priority in the centre is for the adults to support children to learn positive social skills, such as sharing and taking turns.</p><p>ERO observed the educator and parents supporting children and extending their language. They follow the child’s lead. They support children to follow their interests by providing appropriate resources. Parents help their child to focus on and complete the tasks they have set themselves. Children benefit from and make good use of the well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas that provide variety and challenge.</p><p>Early literacy and mathematics are included in the programme. The children enjoy singing waiata and hearing some te reo Māori throughout the session. They participated in a wide range of learning activities during ERO’s visit. An initial mat time has been introduced to welcome new parents and children, and for children to share matters of importance to them and to gain confidence to speak in front of others.</p><p>The group planning in 2013 has a strong focus on helping children to learn about their local community and develop a sense of belonging within it. For example, children have had outings to the beach and the former railway tunnel.</p><p>There is a useful system of planning for each individual child. The adults focus their attention on certain children in each session. The parents and educator discuss the developing needs and interests of these children and how they can support them in the session.</p><p>There are helpful guidelines for parents to learn their roles and responsibilities. The parents are committed to retaining the centre as a vibrant asset to the community. The centre is attractive and well cared for. The community helps to raise funds to ensure the centre’s ongoing viability.</p><p>The SPA provides strong support to the playcentre through:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing adult education</li>
<li>twice-termly visits from the playcentre liaison officer</li>
<li>property and maintenance advice</li>
<li>additional funding as required</li>
<li>help to meet relicensing requirements</li>
<li>a policy and strategic planning framework</li>
<li>sound governance practices.</li>
</ul><p>The SPA provides strong leadership to guide the future direction and ongoing improvement of all its centres. This includes the way association team members foster emergent leadership. Currently there are high numbers of people participating in playcentre training. The association has identified, and ERO agrees, that its next step is to improve its knowledge and understanding of self review. It then needs to support playcentres to implement effective self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The educator and parents should continue to develop how they plan for individual children to better show what strategies they will use and experiences they will provide to help children learn.</p><p>The educator and parents need to develop their knowledge, understanding and use of self review to monitor the centre’s effectiveness in an ongoing way.</p><p>The strategic plan would be a more useful document if it contained detail about how the goals might be met and indicators of what good practice would look like. It should also have a greater focus on improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Toi Tois Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO found that risks for excursions beyond the playcentre need to be better identified and managed. The risk analysis and management system needs to be improved to show more clearly how the identified hazards will be eliminated, isolated or minimised.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Toi Tois Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>28 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
