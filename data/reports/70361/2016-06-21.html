</table><p>Forfar Nursery and Preschool is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Forfar Nursery and Preschool is located in a large renovated house which is divided into two areas to accommodate a nursery and a preschool. The centre is operated by a community-based service and is managed by a centre manager and two head teachers. Almost all the teachers are ECE qualified, with one teacher currently in training.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states in part, that children should be able to create, explore, make friends and have fun in a home-like environment.</p><p>The centre has met all the 2013 ERO review recommendations. The philosophy clearly supports <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre's procedures and practices link closely to the values and vision.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children happily play together and are highly engaged in their activities. They have a good range of learning experiences in their natural outdoor environment including caring for their vegetable gardens. Teachers intentionally promote and encourage healthy eating and physical activity with the children.</p><p>Teachers readily respond to children's interests and needs. They plan collaboratively and openly share effective practice and ideas. They know the children well and provide a range of stimulating and challenging resources to effectively extend their thinking. Well planned, flexible transitions support children's smooth movement through the centre and on to school.</p><p>Children have meaningful experiences of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori through waiata and karakia. The staff and children are very welcoming and supportive of each other. Bicultural practices are fully included in the programme and in the environment.</p><p>Teachers and parents work in partnership to meet the needs of the children. Teachers are nurturing and caring. Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a calm and friendly environment. Teachers provide a range of resources and opportunities to support younger children to develop their social confidence and physical skills. Children with specific learning needs are catered for in a sensitive and caring manner.</p><p>Parents' views are strongly valued. Their ideas are regularly sought and used in the planning and assessment of children's learning. Teachers value this partnership and arrange different events to consolidate this positive and purposeful connection with families.</p><p>The centre is very well governed and managed. The centre leaders have developed good systems and guidelines to ensure the sustainability of effective practices. Both centre leaders and teachers have high expectations for learning and teaching. The appraisal process includes a strong emphasis on teachers' self reflection and research-based professional knowledge. The self-review process is well focused on identifying strengths and ensuring ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees that the next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>link the centre's values to bicultural values in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further embed and strengthen the appraisal process by linking teachers' goals to the centre's strategic plan and include a formal observation with written feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the evaluative aspects of the centre's self-review process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Forfar Nursery and Preschoolwill be in four years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>21 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
