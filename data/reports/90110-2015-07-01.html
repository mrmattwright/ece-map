</table><p>This centre has made limited progress against the recommendations in the two 2008 and 2012 ERO reports.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikiwi Childcare &amp; Preschool is a small independent centre for children aged 0 ‚Äì 5 years. Infants and toddlers are cared for and play in their own attractive, well-resourced area for most of the day. At other times they are with other children in a mixed-age setting. Each infant and toddler has a teacher assigned to them so that they can build a close bond.</p><p>The owner is also the manager and works part time as a teacher. She is assisted by a head teacher who works primarily with the infants and toddlers. All the teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. Most have worked at the centre for over four years.</p><p>The centre is in a large converted house and has a homely feel. Children make good use of the extensive outdoor area.</p><p>There has been some recent progress against the recommendations in ERO‚Äôs 2012 report. However, most areas require further work.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><h4>Curriculum, teaching and learning</h4><p>Children have trusting relationships with their teachers and play well alongside, and with each other. Many children have developed special friendships.</p><p>The children know the centre routines and expectations. They enthusiastically help clean up before mat times, know what to expect and when. They eagerly participate in activities at mat time, such as music and movement.</p><p>Teachers intentionally support the development of children‚Äôs social skills. They show children ways to interact with their peers in positive ways. They also encourage older children to care about, notice and involve the younger children. Relationships with siblings are encouraged and children often pop into the infant/toddler area to visit and play.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profiles are an attractive record of children‚Äôs learning experiences in the centre. They often include reflections about what learning is taking place. They also include frequent references to children‚Äôs interests and learning dispositions.</p><p>Other special features of this centre are:</p><ul>
<li>a programme (with a strong literacy and social skills focus) designed to help children be ready for, and make a smooth transition to school</li>
<li>regular outings into local community, such as visits to a local rest home</li>
<li>an increased focus on extending children‚Äôs early mathematics learning</li>
<li>efforts made by teachers to support children new to New Zealand</li>
<li>the increased visibility of MƒÅori language in centre displays.</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a quiet and calm area. In this area, teachers have identified appropriate learning goals. ERO observed gentle and nurturing relationships between teachers and these children. Infants also benefit from well-chosen sensory resources that encourage them to explore their environment and their own capability.</p><h4>Next steps</h4><p>Centre leaders need to ensure that planning and assessment for individual children have a stronger focus on learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>better gathering and use of parents‚Äô wishes for their children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>setting more useful learning goals, that incorporate parents‚Äô wishes</li>
<li>being clear about the strategies they will use to support the learning goals</li>
<li>ensuring that they reflect on the effectiveness of strategies they use to promote children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers need to unpack the centre‚Äôs philosophy as to what it should look like in practice. In particular, they need to think deeply about the strategies they will use to promote the stated learning priorities.</p><p>Teachers should increase their use of te reo MƒÅori and MƒÅori perspectives in the programme.</p><h4>Governance and management</h4><p>The manager and head teacher work closely together. They demonstrate a desire to improve how the centre provides for children. To help them achieve this they are building links with other early childhood centres and specialists. ERO sees this as a constructive way to keep up to date with changes and improvements in the early childhood sector.</p><p>Teachers in their feedback to ERO said that there is a positive staff culture. The leaders have been encouraging teachers to collaborate more and participate in conversations about children‚Äôs learning and decision making. Teachers take on special responsibilities. For example, one teacher is responsible for the transition to school programme.</p><p>Staff and children have benefitted from teachers‚Äô recent participation in professional development about mathematics for young children and self review. Both have led to changes in practice and an increased understanding of the importance of self review. The manager has recently reviewed the appraisal system so that it better aligns with the registered teacher criteria.</p><h4>Next steps</h4><p>Centre leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>identify the centre‚Äôs priorities for future development and ensure that these are reflected in the centre‚Äôs long term (strategic) and short term planning</li>
<li>ensure alignment between long and short terms plans, professional development, self review and appraisal</li>
<li>continue to extend and embed recent improvements to self review</li>
<li>ensure that self review includes the review of important aspects of teaching and learning</li>
<li>ensure that staff and the manager benefit from a thorough appraisal process each year.</li>
</ul><p>When reviewing policies and procedures, centre leaders need to ensure that these reflect best practice and current legal requirements.</p><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikiwi Childcare &amp; Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h4>Actions for compliance</h4><p>ERO identified two areas of non-compliance. Appraisals had not been completed for all staff and the manager since the 2012 ERO review. There were inadequate risk-management plans and record keeping for excursions. To meet legal requirements, the manager needs to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that the manager and all staff are appropriately appraised each year [GMA7 <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></li>
<li>ensure excursion planning and records meet legal requirements [HS17 <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008].</em></li>
</ul><p>ERO discussed several other areas where practices could be improved. These related to more careful record keeping for medications, food preparation and emergency drills, and more rigour in safety checks.</p><h4>Development Plan Recommendation</h4><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h4>Next ERO Review</h4><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Waikiwi Childcare &amp; Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
