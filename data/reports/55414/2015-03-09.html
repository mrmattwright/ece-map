</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PORSE Takanini is a network operating under notional early childhood education provider PORSE In-Home Childcare. With a strong focus on education and training, PORSE supports individuals, families and communities by using the latest scientific research in early brain development and attachment theory to inform programme delivery and address education needs.</p>
<p>The Vision, 'expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home' is anchored with a Mission 'to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care'. There are two models that PORSE offers as a part of in-home childcare delivery — the Home Educator model, where an educator works from their own home and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works from the family's home. Of the 100 children enrolled in the network at the time of this ERO review, 10 identify as Māori.</p>
<p>Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators to provide ongoing support with learning programmes to enhance learning and development opportunities for children. PORSE also supports families and educators with contract set-up, administration and payroll services. Community coaches in Auckland support programme tutors working alongside national coaches to support national consistency and quality outcomes for children.</p>
<p>This review was a part of a cluster of five home-based network reviews for PORSE In-Home Childcare.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children benefit from a variety of meaningful learning experiences within the home and local community. Children’s sense of belonging is promoted within the home through the small group size, and high adult-to-child ratios. The small group size particularly supports the wellbeing of infants and toddlers. Programme tutors encourage educators to access a variety of playgroups, including a nature playschool where children can actively explore and learn about the natural world. Attendance at playgroups and outings in the local community provide valuable opportunities for children and educators to socialise with one another.</p>
<p>Programme tutors provide professional guidance and support to extend educators' individual knowledge about quality education and care. They work alongside educators to help them understand and implement <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and record children's experiences in learning journals. These documents are shared with families who are also invited to outline aspirations for their child's learning. Resources and readings are made accessible to educators to promote literacy and mathematical learning through children's play and in daily home experiences. A greater emphasis on documenting children's learning would enhance these records.</p>
<p>Considerable thought is given to matching educators and families, and an emphasis is placed on ensuring positive relationships underpin all aspects of the child’s experiences. Programme tutors effectively support educators to provide appropriate education and care. They regularly visit children and educators. During these visits they provide advice and guidance, resources and monitor the health and safety of the environment.</p>
<p>Professional development undertaken by programme tutors over two years, has resulted in improvement and increased the participation of Māori children in home-based education and care in Takanini. Family educators contribute to providing contextually relevant experiences for Māori children. Some programme tutors have particular skills and expertise in te ao Māori and share these strengths with other programme tutors and educators.</p>
<p>The views of families are welcomed by the organisation to enhance positive outcomes for children. Families are consulted and invited to share their views and have input into their child’s education and care. A collaborative team culture and professional approach is evident within PORSE management and leadership.</p>
<p>Management is improvement focused and has some well established systems and processes for monitoring practices. Self-review practice is developing. Using a more evaluative approach to review, that focuses on the quality and effectiveness of practice and the impact on outcomes for children, should strengthen current practice.</p>
<p>PORSE operational and administration systems effectively support educators, programme tutors and coaches in their roles. Career pathways are well designed. Rewards for study and achievement of particular milestones are available for educators and programme tutors. Emphasis is placed on ensuring that all reasonable steps are taken to meet health and safety requirements in the home. Clear documentation outlines useful induction procedures for educators and programme tutors.</p>
<p>A good range of professional learning and development is available nationally and locally. Training opportunities and readings on the PORSE website enable educators and programme tutors to keep up-to-date with current early childhood practice. The appraisal process is currently being reviewed to align with the Registered Teacher Criteria. Clear reporting processes to the senior leadership team keep them informed of initiatives and systems being reviewed. Programme tutors regularly meet to reflect on daily practices and how they can be further improved.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and PORSE management agree areas for ongoing development include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>embedding a more evaluative self-review process into practice and more clearly documenting the impact of self review in relation to positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the performance management process for teaching staff to further embed the links to the professional teaching requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing documentation of programme tutors' guidance and coaching in educators' in-visit notes, and the recording of children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Takanini Q1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of PORSE Takanini Q1 will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
