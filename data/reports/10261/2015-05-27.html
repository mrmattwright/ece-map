</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre Ltd is located in Glen Eden, Auckland. In January 2015, the centre had a change of licence, bringing together both the Kidd Inn and Just Kidd Inn services. It is now licensed to provide education and care for 85 children, including 24 up to the age of two years. The centre has been re-developed with new purpose-built facilities that are divided into three age-related areas. This review is of Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre, with a specific focus on provisions for children aged three to five years. An earlier ERO review of the former Just Kidd Inn centre in 2014 focused on the younger children, and findings of this review are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy has an emphasis on children&rsquo;s wellbeing and belonging. It includes using the environment to promote learning, with the outdoor area and natural world in particular serving as a teacher. The three main principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi: partnership through strong communication with parents and wh&#257;nau; protection of the M&#257;ori language; and participation in learning opportunities for children are also included in the centre philosophy.</p><p>Two team leaders manage the centre. The teaching team includes fully and provisionally registered teachers, teachers in training and unqualified staff.</p><p>Many of the positive features identified in the 2012 ERO report continue to be evident in the centre. That report recommended that learning conversations with children and programme planning, assessment and evaluation be further developed to support ongoing improvements in children&rsquo;s learning. Progress is evident in some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They interact in a relaxed and friendly manner and they make choices about their play. Children are encouraged to develop self-managing and independent skills.</p><p>Teachers are caring and responsive as they work alongside children. Programmes for children up to two years of age reflect good practice. A feature of the centre is the focus placed on care-giving to foster children's emotional wellbeing. Inclusive practices are evident and there is regular communication between parents and primary caregivers of children with special needs. Important features of the centre are the strong relationships formed with parents and the commitment of staff to providing a successful early childhood education service for children and families.</p><p>Teachers carefully plan the environment. Children are provided with an attractive, very well resourced and spacious indoor area. The renovated outdoor area provides natural spaces for them to explore and investigate.</p><p>Teachers use positive and affirming language to encourage and support children. It would be worthwhile to further develop teachers&rsquo; questioning skills. This could assist teachers to help children share their thinking and to promote children's interest in the programme enriching the learning experiences provided.</p><p>Teachers show some knowledge of te reo M&#257;ori and use individual words and short phrases. Centre managers are planning to further build teacher capacity in this area. A teacher, who has good knowledge of te reo is able to support the learning of other staff. These initiatives and the use of relevant Ministry of Education resources, could help increase teacher confidence and knowledge of te ao M&#257;ori, and increase the integration of tikanga M&#257;ori into the centre programme.</p><p>Curriculum planning is based on noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s individual and group interests. Teachers make good use of electronic resources to keep parents informed and involved in their child&rsquo;s learning. Parents and wh&#257;nau often comment on these stories, giving feedback on their child&rsquo;s progress and development. To extend the centre programme it would be useful for teachers to further involve children in the programme planning process.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s governance and management systems are effective and efficient. Policies and procedures are regularly audited. Self review is used as a tool to identify good practices and areas to improve. The centre provides teachers with professional learning opportunities to develop their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that centre review and development could focus on continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>make bicultural practice a priority in the centre</li>
<li>develop ways in which the centre&rsquo;s philosophy is made visible in daily teaching programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
