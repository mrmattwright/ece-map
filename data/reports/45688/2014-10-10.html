</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the first ERO review of Funshine Early Learning Centre. The service has been open since 2011 and is overseen by a trust. It is located in Riversdale, a rural community close to Gore, Southland.</p><p>Funshine provides education and care for children over two years of age until they start school. The small centre is open from 9am until 3pm each weekday.</p><p>A new head teacher had been in the position for 10 months at the time of this review. She is new to the role of head teacher and is currently upgrading her early childhood qualifications. The mostly qualified staff, work to a philosophy that aligns with Christian beliefs, <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum and values New Zealand’s bicultural heritage.</p><p>The centre’s outdoor environment is currently being developed. A large covered outdoor deck has been completed and provides easy access from inside to a spacious play area outside.</p><p>Trustees and teachers desire to form strong links with families and the wider community. They value respectful, supportive relationships with children, families and each other.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><h4>Governance and leadership</h4><p>Trustees, whānau and the teaching team have established a service that is welcoming and inclusive.</p><p>The centre is well supported by the community and trustees. The head teacher and president of the trust have worked hard to establish useful systems to manage the service. Policies and procedures are in place to guide practice, and strategic and annual plans provide a basis to support the ongoing development of the service.</p><h4>Curriculum, teaching and learning</h4><p>ERO observed a strong sense of pride and ownership of the centre. Children enjoy being in a place that is inclusive of diversity and where they feel cared for. Teachers know the children and their families well and have positive, supportive relationships with the children and their families.</p><p>Children work well alongside the teachers, alone or together in small groups. They engage for sustained periods in imaginative and creative play. Teachers are supportive and affirming when working with children and frequently make links between the centre and the children’s home life.</p><p>Teachers incidentally integrate mathematics concepts and early-literacy learning as they work with the children. Some teachers are highly skilled at encouraging children to explore ideas and discover new things as they work and play with the centre resources.</p><p>Other positive features of the centre that support children include:</p><ul>
<li>a range of resources that provide opportunities for construction and dramatic play</li>
<li>how the teaching team work together to establish centre routines and expectations</li>
<li>children being able to access attractive profile books that contain photos and stories showing their involvement in the programme and describing what they can do.</li>
</ul><p>A key feature of the centre is the opportunity for children to learn te reo Māori and to become familiar with New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. This is due to the appointment of a teacher who models the integration of te reo Māori in a way that is meaningful and empowering.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the president of the governing trust and the head teacher who identified the following next steps.</p><h4>Governance and leadership</h4><p>The board and head teacher need to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify the roles and responsibilities of governance and management</li>
<li>develop processes for how resources are allocated throughout the service</li>
<li>develop the centre’s strategic and annual plans so that they align with the centre philosophy and provide a way forward for key aspects of the service over time.</li>
</ul><h4>Curriculum, teaching and learning</h4><p>The head teacher and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>review the centre philosophy to ensure that there is a shared understanding as to what it should look like in practice across the service</li>
<li>implement effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes to support learning for individuals and groups of children</li>
<li> include parents’ aspirations when planning for children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Funshine Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Funshine Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Southern Region</p><p>10 October 2014 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
