</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>My Tree Hut is located in Taupō township and it is a full day child care licensed for 40 children over two years of age. Currently there are 57 toddlers and young children on the roll. The centre was opened in October 2011 and is privately owned and operated.</p><p>The owner licensee has a clear vision to provide positive outcomes for all children in a safe environment. The service philosophy aims to maintain high-quality relationships and provide a stimulating learning programme for young children and toddlers. Features in the programme include a wide range of resources and equipment and a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability. These features provide many opportunities to for children to play and explore their interests.</p><p>The newly appointed head teacher and owner work collaboratively with all staff to maintain professional relationships with one another and positive relationships with parents. Staff have a shared understanding about teaching practice and how children learn. There is a high number of qualified teachers and three trainee teachers. All staff work to provide purposeful and meaningful learning experiences for children.</p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>My Tree Hut is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Children enthusiastically participate in a programme that is focused on how they can contribute to the concept of sustainability. This holistic approach involves children in a wide range of stimulating experiences. These include:</p><ul>
<li>environmental activities, which promote awareness and knowledge of what sustainable behaviours look like</li>
<li>positive social relationships among children and teachers which engage children in cooperative play</li>
<li>cultural competencies, particularly in te reo and tikanga Māori, which extend their perspective of New Zealand society and promote biculturalism.</li>
</ul><p>Children have many opportunities to make choices. They freely express their opinions and play with one another and in groups of their own choosing. Children work together and with teachers to explore and learn through play for extended periods of time.</p><p>Teachers effectively document children’s emerging interests in learning stories. They notice, recognise and respond to children’s interests to guide their teaching. There is a strong focus on building children’s early literacy and mathematic concepts. This includes using books for research and providing opportunities for children to enjoy learning in a sustainable environment.</p><p>Parents are well informed through regular formal and informal conversations with teachers about their child’s care, learning and development. Teachers are very responsive and work hard to ensure parents have a good understanding about their child’s progress. Teachers share the learning programme for individual children and work with parents to ensure that each child’s transition into the centre and to school is a positive experience.</p><p>An effective approach to transitioning children who are approaching school age has been established. Each teacher has responsibility for an identified school and they are responsible for the establishment of good relationships with their local school. Teachers support families of children with identified special needs and they sensitively practice care and education for these children. Ongoing positive relationships are valued by parents and contribute to children’s wellbeing.</p><p>Māori children benefit from a programme that is consistent and increasingly bicultural. In 2012 teachers decided to participate in the Tūwharetoa festival. This required teachers to prepare themselves and children with an integrated te reo and tikanga Māori programme. This proactive approach has assisted teachers to establish close and ongoing relationships with parents, whānau, hapū and iwi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Self review of the strategic plan needs to be further developed to include:</p><ul>
<li>goals that are focused on teaching and learning</li>
<li>the alignment of strategic goals with teacher appraisal and professional development</li>
<li>programme review and development</li>
<li>the purpose of Discovery folders and how children learning is documented.</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these aspects will more effectively build teacher capability and promote reflective practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of My Treehut completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of My Treehut will be in three years. </p><p>Dale Bailey<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Northern Region</p><p>7 November 2013 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
