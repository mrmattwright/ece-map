</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Minds Childcare is a privately owned service that provides education and care for up to 26 children with up to 16 under two years of age. Children attending the centre come from diverse cultures and several speak languages other than English. Some of the staff reflect the diverse backgrounds of children and families, and can communicate with them in their home languages.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review staffing at the centre has remained stable and this has helped to establish positive relationships between centre staff and families. The centre‚Äôs philosophy promotes learning in a caring and family-like environment. The centre caters for children in a mixed age setting. Managers and staff value working with parents to promote their children‚Äôs learning and development. They have a good knowledge of families and the local community.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted an increased emphasis on child-focused programmes and an improvement in teachers‚Äô planning for children‚Äôs learning. The report recommended that further work was needed to extend children‚Äôs ongoing learning, teachers‚Äô appraisals and self review. Centre managers and staff have responded positively to these recommendations and have worked with external advisers to develop good quality teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is very evident in teaching practice and children‚Äôs play. There is a calm, settled tone in the centre and children enjoy inclusive relationships with adults and each other. Children benefit from staff who care about their wellbeing and encourage them to become socially confident. Children with special education needs are nurtured by responsive relationships with adults. Teachers provide individualised care for infants and toddlers and build trusting relationships with them.</p><p>Teachers foster children‚Äôs language, culture and identity in the centre. Children hear multiple languages and are accepting of and learn about other cultures. Teachers continue to develop bicultural aspects in the curriculum to support children to develop an awareness of Aotearoa New Zealand's bicultural heritage.</p><p>Teachers plan and provide a curriculum programme that has been increasingly responsive to children‚Äôs interests and strengths. Children experience opportunities for long periods of uninterrupted play. They regularly visit the local library where they enjoy books and can learn about their interests and other cultures. Children‚Äôs readiness for school is supported through their development of self management skills and meaningful integration of literacy and mathematics knowledge in the context of their play.</p><p>Teachers have responded well to professional learning to guide their programme planning and evaluation. Planning is now well documented and evaluated and is displayed for children and parents. Assessment portfolios include observations of children‚Äôs participation and learning in their preferred activities and interests.</p><p>The licensee and manager have worked collaboratively with staff to review the centre‚Äôs philosophy and build a shared understanding about expectations for their professional practice. They are growing staff leadership capacity by delegating responsibilities in curriculum and self review. Teachers‚Äô appraisals are appropriately linked to the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Planned and spontaneous self review is positively influencing teaching practices and children‚Äôs learning. Teachers have benefitted from professional learning, with external advisers, focused on self review. They are also learning together as they reflect on the effectiveness of their programmes and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers have identified relevant priorities for development that include:</p><ul>
<li>further involving children, parents and families in programme planning</li>
<li>continuing to develop self review processes, and strengthen teachers‚Äô reflection on the impact of their practices on children's engagement and learning</li>
<li>developing teachers‚Äô knowledge of different languages to enhance communication and relationships with children and their families.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers acknowledge that next steps could also include:</p><ul>
<li>developing and aligning longer term planning with annual plans to consolidate the good progress made in teaching practices</li>
<li>further including children‚Äôs home languages and parent perspectives in children's portfolios</li>
<li>updating the teacher appraisal policy to reflect current centre practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Minds Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice managers should attend to the following health and safety matters in the outdoor environment:</p><ul>
<li>aerating and topping up barked areas for better safe-fall protection</li>
<li>repairing the subsiding back fence.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Minds Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>11 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
