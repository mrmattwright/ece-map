</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kauwhata Childcare and Early Learning Centre Over Threes is one of two centres in Te Kauwhata that are owned and operated by Glenda Rankin Ltd. Together these centres provide full-day education and care services for children from birth to school age. The centre being reviewed caters for children over three years of age. At the time of the ERO review visit, the roll of 33 included three children of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre director has responsibility for employment and financial matters. She delegates aspects of professional leadership, including programme planning, to the team coordinator and head teacher. The teaching team of five includes the three managers, who are qualified early childhood teachers, and two unqualified teachers.</p><p>In consultation with staff and parents, centre leaders have recently reviewed the centre‚Äôs philosophy. This statement reflects the importance placed on developing a sense of wellbeing and belonging for children and their families, and providing a balanced curriculum in which children learn through play and reciprocal and responsive relationships.</p><p>Centre leaders responded positively to areas for development in the 2011 ERO report. Eating routines now place an increased emphasis on developing children's social skills and healthy nutrition. Staff also have participated in professional development to increase their use of te reo MƒÅori with the children, and to support consultation with tangata whenua about the history and cultural significance of local areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play well with and alongside peers, and learn to respect the needs of others. Daily routines are well designed to foster development of self management and communication skills. Children enjoy ready access to spacious and attractive outdoor environments which invite exploration and provide a variety of physical challenges. Play areas are well resourced, and teachers make effective use of natural and real life materials to extend children‚Äôs play. Centre leaders recognise that increasing children‚Äôs independent access to equipment and resources should increase the level and complexity of children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô interactions and relationships with children are responsive, respectful and affirming. They skilfully foster the development of communication and social skills. Teachers know children and their families well. They encourage children to express their ideas and feelings and to talk about their lives outside of the centre. Teachers use questions to extend children‚Äôs thinking and to stimulate children‚Äôs curiosity and creativity. They also encourage children to identify and solve problems, and to use computer technologies to research areas of interest.</p><p>Teachers provide a child-centred programme. They are very responsive to children‚Äôs questions, ideas and interests that emerge through play. Teachers also provide planned activities with a strong emphasis on developing early literacy and mathematical concepts, and fine motor skills. They make good use of the local community to enrich and extend learning experiences for children. Teachers are increasingly including aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and local MƒÅori history in the programme. Centre leaders and teachers work closely with school personnel and families/whƒÅnau to support older children to transition to the nearby primary school.</p><p>The centre continues to maintain positive and respectful relationships with parents/whƒÅnau. Parents feel valued and included and find staff to be very approachable. Teachers keep families well informed about their children‚Äôs learning and the programme through informal discussions, children‚Äôs portfolios and displays. They regularly give parents written summaries about their children‚Äôs learning and progress, and work in partnership with them to develop individual learning plans for their children. Centre leaders agree that portfolios could more consistently reflect children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds, document language development and possible ways to extend emerging interests and learning.</p><p>The centre director values the diverse strengths of centre leaders and teaching staff, and encourages them to work collaboratively in the best interests of children. This is most evident in the programme planning process. Self review has also resulted in improvements to curriculum areas and centre displays.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and the director agrees, that there is an urgent need to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify the professional leadership roles and responsibilities of the director, team coordinator and head teacher</li>
<li>establish job descriptions that document the responsibilities for each position</li>
<li>develop a robust system for appraising the implementation of these additional responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>In additional, centre leaders should work with external support to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>aspects of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kauwhata Childcare &amp; Learning Centre Over Threes completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kauwhata Childcare &amp; Learning Centre Over Threes will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>28 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
