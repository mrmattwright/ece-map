</table><p>The centre is well placed to provide education and care for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Poppies Preschool St Martins is one of four centres administered by Peppertree Preschool Ltd. This centre provides education and care for babies, toddlers and preschool children in three separate areas.</p><p>Nearly all staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Since the 2015 ERO report a new supervisor and a number of new staff have been appointed.</p><p>The management structure and many of the systems are shared across the four centres. A curriculum leader has responsibility for the curriculum across the centres.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have made good progress towards meeting the recommendations in the 2015 ERO report. They have made good progress in improving the assessment of children's learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two early childhood centres operating under Peppertree Preschool Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in welcoming, settled environments. Teachers demonstrate caring relationships and respectful interactions with the infants, toddlers and children.</p><p>Teachers provide well-managed programmes that recognise children's interests. They ensure that learning opportunities are meaningful and enjoyable for children. Activities and resources provide children with choices and challenge.</p><p>Teachers effectively use children's strengths, interests and needs in planning. They increasingly identify teaching strategies in planning and assessments that impact positively on children's learning.</p><p>Teachers in the nursery provide responsive caregiving and are nurturing in their approach to meeting the needs of infants and toddlers. They carefully connect their care provisions with home routines to provide consistency and continuity. Teachers are sensitive to non-verbal cues and engage in positive one-to-one interactions to promote the wellbeing of those in their care.</p><p>Children's readiness for school is well recognised and supported. Teachers promote positive dispositions for learning and integrate literacy and mathematics into children's play.</p><p>Internal evaluation, while at the early stages, has led to specific improvements. This is particularly evident in the changes to assessment practice that now clearly show children's progress.</p><p>Leaders, in consultation with parents and teachers, have developed a strategic plan that clearly identifies the service's priorities. Implementation of the plans is regularly monitored. The plans are clearly linked to teacher appraisal goals.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to regularly reflect and improve their practice. Leaders provide useful feedback about the progress that teachers are making towards meeting the expectations for effective teaching.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the service provider and leaders agree the next steps for Peppertree Preschool Ltd include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further building and supporting professional capability and practice across the centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing better ways to involve Māori and Pacific families in decision-making and their children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for Poppies Preschool St Martins include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving the physical environment for infants and toddlers under two years of age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of structured interruptions to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending the consistency of specific goal setting in planning for individuals and groups, and including parents' aspirations and children's views more intentionally in this process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Poppies Preschool St Martins completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Poppies Preschool St Martins will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>28 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
