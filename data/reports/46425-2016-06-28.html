</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childtime Learning EC Home-Based Service provides for children up to six years of age from across Auckland. The philosophy of the service is to &lsquo;support Russian children and families to maintain a connection with their language and culture&rsquo;. All of the children enrolled have Russian heritage.</p><p>Educators in this service work in homes to provide education and care for up to four children at any one time. A coordinator who is a qualified, certified early childhood teacher visits homes and supports educators to plan and provide educational programmes for children based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The coordinator leads a fortnightly playgroup to model new ideas and ways to extend children&rsquo;s learning. The owner is responsible for the overall governance of the service.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Childtime Learning EC Home-Based Service which was established in 2014.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from caring, respectful relationships with an educator who knows them well. They maintain strong connections with their Russian language and culture and also learn to speak English. Each home has established routines within which educators provide a range of learning opportunities for children. Environments are well resourced to cater for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Educators provide programmes that are based on children&rsquo;s interests. Learning records show that through everyday activities children are very well supported to develop their creativity, early literacy and mathematics and science knowledge. Children are encouraged to explore and ask questions. A focus on physical skills provides children with many opportunities to practice their coordination and balance. Through music and community experiences children develop an understanding of Aotearoa New Zealand's bicultural heritage.</p><p>In-depth learning records show how children&rsquo;s progress and learning is extended and becomes more complex over time. The coordinator works with educators skilfully to help them recognise learning and plan next steps to challenge children. She has regular discussions with educators and writes effective guidance and feedback to help build their teaching practice. The coordinator communicates with families well and is responsive to their wishes for their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Regular playgroups and excursions foster children's social development, independence and sense of their Russian heritage. Playgroups are planned and learning outcomes are clearly identified by the coordinator. Children's strengths and interests could now be used as a basis for playgroup planning.</p><p>Information that parents provided shows they are very satisfied with the service. They particularly appreciate the variety of activities provided in homes and the local community. Opportunities for children to learn about their Russian language and culture and have a traditional menu, are valued. Parents commented on the friendly, open relationships they have with the owner, coordinator and educators.</p><p>The coordinator's curriculum, management and appraisal records show a high level of leadership and professional practice. Evaluation processes are robust and used to measure changes that result in improved outcomes for children and families.</p><p>The owner and coordinator work well together and are committed to improvement. A clear philosophy is embedded across all aspects of the service. Relevant short term goals inform current priorities for development. Useful policies and procedures guide operational requirements. Appropriate systems are in place to monitor health and safety requirements in educators&rsquo; homes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and coordinator agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing long-term goals to inform ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the extent to which curriculum documentation shows parents' contributions to their child's learning</p>
</li>
</ul><p>documenting the improvements in educator practice that result from the coordinator's mentoring and guidance.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childtime Learning EC Home Based Service completed an ERO <em>Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull; curriculum</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull; premises and facilities</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull; health and safety practices</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull; governance, management and administration.</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childtime Learning EC Home Based Service will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
