</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sparkles Home-based Childcare and Education operates across Auckland with office premises based in New Lynn. This report summarises EROs findings for the first of the two Sparkles services, which opened in 2015. This is the first ERO review for this licence.</p><p>The service provides education and care for 80 children that can include 60 children up to the age of two years. All of the children enrolled in the service have Chinese family heritage and all staff employed are Chinese. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. They are regularly visited by a team of coordinators who support educators to plan for children's learning. Coordinators also monitor health and safety systems in the homes.</p><p>The service owner/manager is supported well by a team leader. Both are qualified, registered early childhood teachers with several years of experience in early childhood education. They work closely with coordinators to ensure administration systems, learning processes and health and safety measures are in place.</p><p>There are six coordinators who work in the Sparkles services and they are all registered and qualified early childhood teachers. Three of them have been recently appointed to the coordinator role.</p><p>Programmes of learning for children are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and blended with a strong commitment to the languages, culture and identity of Chinese children and their families. The service philosophy supports the individual learning of each child and acknowledges how children learn in different ways according to their interests, strengths and needs.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Learning records show that children's wellbeing is being fostered in educators' homes. There is good evidence that educators understand the learning characteristics of infants and toddlers. Educators design children's learning based on everyday activities and experiences. Children are benefitting from learning that is supported through their home languages.</p><p>Coordinators capably analyse the learning recorded in children's portfolios and sometimes identify possible next steps. Coordinators now need to document how educators will follow up on suggested next steps in learning and extend their planning to encourage children's progress over time. Written portfolios and other useful digital platforms encourage families to share information with educators and become involved in their child's learning.</p><p>Coordinators as a group are forming shared understandings about their role. They are helping to build educators' confidence and capability. Developing formal induction processes for coordinators would support their understanding of both curriculum management and their role in monitoring the implementation of up-to-date health and safety requirements.</p><p>The service has appropriately focused on setting up systems and operations to establish home-based care and learning during the first two years. While strategic and annual plans are in place to guide this development there could now be more explicit expectations about the key priorities to drive the service's next phase of growth. An example could be a more planned approach to the development of bicultural practice in the curriculum.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has been recently reviewed and priorities have emerged from this evaluation process. Changes have been made to the centre philosophy that are guiding service improvement.</p><p>Useful systems were put in place to ensure the health and safety of children but they now need to be more regularly updated to meet new legislative changes. The owner plans to improve the monitoring of health and safety through management assurance visits to educator homes.</p><p>An appraisal system for managers and coordinators has been developed. This needs further review to improve the quality of evidence being collected. A focus for professional development could be to promote and develop the leadership capability of coordinators as leaders of learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and ERO agree that next key steps to develop practice should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening systems to monitor health and safety in educators' homes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving curriculum systems to better plan for and evaluate individual children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how well the philosophy is evident in teaching practice and the service's documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a curriculum that acknowledges the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service should access professional development from external providers to assist with this learning for coordinators.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sparkles Home-Based Childcare and Education completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to be compliant the service must meet the licensing requirements for:</p><ul>
<li>a written supervision plan that ensures the health and safety of children enrolled in the service is maintained at all times.<br><em>Education [Early Childhood Services] Regulations 2008; Licensing criteria for home-based ECE Services (HS 34).</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sparkles Home-Based Childcare and Education will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
