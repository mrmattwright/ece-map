</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Newstead Country Preschool is a privately owned, purpose-built early childhood centre located in a spacious and attractively-presented farm setting near Hamilton City.</p><p>The centre is licensed to care for 37 children including 15 children under two years of age in three adjacent, age-based areas. At the time of this ERO review there were 50 children enrolled, including 7 identified as MƒÅori. The management team remains committed to employing qualified early childhood teachers and maintaining adult-to-child ratios that are above licensing requirements.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2012 the centre has come under new ownership. The new owner has a long-standing and close relationship with the centre and staff. This has contributed to a smooth transition and continuity for children and their families. The centre manager has been in her position for many years and works in a positive partnership with the new owner. Teaching staff is largely the same since 2012, with a number of student teachers spending time in the centre as part of their pre-service training.</p><p>Good progress has been made with the areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO report related to improving strategic and annual planning, self review and programme planning. While some positive changes to the appraisal system have been made, there continues to be a need to strengthen performance management systems and processes. Teachers participated in ongoing professional development in 2014 to build their understanding of self review, assessment, planning and evaluation. There have been a number of improvements and upgrades to buildings and grounds that have enhanced teaching and learning outcomes for children and adults.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to <em>‚Äòoffer quality experiences that foster children‚Äôs learning and help them develop into confident and competent akonga.‚Äô</em></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Newstead Country Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children and their families and whƒÅnau. Children are confident and active explorers from an early age. They enjoy an outstanding natural environment for regular walks to bush, farmland, gardens and places of local interest. Teachers are calm and unhurried as they foster children‚Äôs curiosity in discovering the natural world around them.</p><p>Children demonstrate courage and resilience as they learn to manage challenges in the environment. They are imaginative in their play and encouraged to take on dramatic roles during daily walks to places of their choice. Boys and active learners are highly engaged as they adventure in wide open spaces. Many pets and farm animals present children with opportunities to learn about caring for animals, animal husbandry and life cycles in meaningful contexts. Planting and harvesting fresh food from the centre gardens is an important part of the centre programme. Children express themselves creatively through the arts and have acquired many skills in drawing, painting, pottery and dramatic play. Adults are respectful and appreciative of children‚Äôs artworks as they build children‚Äôs knowledge and skills in using a variety of media competently.</p><p>There is an appropriate emphasis on literacy learning and number knowledge. Children and teachers read together, take time to share songs and finger plays, both spontaneously and during set mat times. Older children are encouraged to write stories, design and build projects, and participate in improving the environment with ideas and constructions of their own. They are respectful of younger children and show leadership and responsibility in their interactions with them. Children are developing high levels of social, physical and intellectual skills as they near school age.</p><p>Children have well-presented, individual learning portfolios that record aspects of their participation in the programme. These portfolios enable children to revisit their learning and share it with teachers, friends and family. In addition, teachers have recently introduced e-portfolios to share children‚Äôs learning with parents and extended families. Parents expressed appreciation for the ease with which they can share in their children‚Äôs learning journey, and contribute their ideas and perspectives using technology in this way. There would be benefit in reviewing children‚Äôs portfolios. This review should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing and documenting shared and agreed expectations for high quality learning portfolios</li>
<li>clearly identifying the language, culture and identity of each child in the context of their family</li>
<li>annotating samples of children‚Äôs artwork to show their relevance to the child‚Äôs learning and development.</li>
</ul><p>Children under two years and toddlers benefit from the nurturing and responsive practice of their teachers. They demonstrate high levels of wellbeing as they learn and play in a settled, calm and interesting environment. Children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing is enhanced through well-planned transitions undertaken at children‚Äôs own pace. Daily communication between parents and teachers maintains familiar routines for children. Centre leaders place priority on regularly surveying and responding to parent‚Äôs ideas and aspirations for their children.</p><p>MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau are affirmed in their culture. They benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>a strong sense of whanaungatanga, established and maintained over many years</li>
<li>close contact with Papat≈´ƒÅnuku and the natural world</li>
<li>te reo MƒÅori used in meaningful contexts</li>
<li>sharing waiata together</li>
<li>respect for tikanga MƒÅori practices</li>
<li>regular celebrations such as Matariki and kapahaka.</li>
</ul><p>Consideration should now be given to the ways the centre will further implement the principles of <em>Ka Hikitia</em>. Strengthening the performance management system by including aspects of <em>TƒÅtaiako</em> is likely to continue to build teachers‚Äô and leaders‚Äô understanding about culturally responsive practices. Consultation with knowledgeable whƒÅnau is now important for continued development of a programme that promotes success for MƒÅori as Maori.</p><p>The multi-cultural teaching team is well qualified and professional. Teachers use their different languages and knowledge to enrich the programme and respond to the needs of children and families. Over a number of years they have established strong and meaningful partnerships with families and each other. They consistently model positive and collegial interactions, share humour and express genuine enjoyment of working together.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to plan the programme and reflect on their practice. They are enthusiastic about participating in regular and relevant professional learning opportunities, both as individuals and as a team. Teachers expressed appreciation for the opportunities they have to share in leadership and decision-making in centre operations.</p><p>A next step in building reflective practice would be for teachers to document the outcomes of planning for individuals and groups of children. This should enable them to measure the effectiveness of their practice.</p><p>The experienced centre manager maintains consistency of leadership for the centre. She models good practice and provides teachers with regular and meaningful feedback about their practice. The appraisal system needs to be strengthened by linking shared and agreed criteria for best practice to better inform targeted feedback for teachers.</p><p>The new centre owner works in a professional and positive partnership with the centre manager. Together they model the commitment and enjoyment they share in providing good quality outcomes for children, their families and whƒÅnau. The centre owner is proactive in seeking external advice as she develops her knowledge of governance in the early childhood sector. A good understanding of self review has resulted in useful frameworks to guide ongoing centre development and improvement. Ongoing professional development will support her to continue to build her understanding of governance roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Newstead Country Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Newstead Country Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
