<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 2.30pm. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere was extensively damaged in the February earthquake resulting in teachers and some of the children being relocated to another Kidsfirst Kindergarten in a neighbouring suburb until the middle of term two. Challenges faced due to this included in changes to operating hours, group size, and teaching team and interruption of programme development.</p><p align="left">Teachers place a strong focus on building and maintaining positive relationships with children and families. They work with children in caring and respectful ways. Families are involved in the kindergarten and make a valued contribution.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on literacy, science and creative play</li>
<li>the spacious, natural outdoor areas that encourage children to explore and be involved in physical play</li>
<li>teachers respecting children as capable and confident learners and communicators.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development. The recently appointed education service manager gives a good level of support to the kindergarten. This is having a positive impact on teaching practices and documentation.</p><p align="left">The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to support ongoing improvement are to build on recent developments in assessment, planning, self review and bicultural practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten vision states that children are confident to make their own choices as they actively explore the well established and creative learning areas. Children will have independent access to a wide variety of resources. Teachers will actively support children in their learning to build on their social skills.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Teachers place a strong focus on building positive relationships with children and families. They know children and families well. Teachers interact with children in caring and respectful ways. They are responsive to the individual needs and interests of children. Regular opportunities for parents and teachers to share information help to support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. ERO observed families who were comfortable to spend time and be involved in the kindergarten.</p><h4>Socially competent and confident children</h4><p align="left">Children respond well to the teachers&rsquo; view of them as capable and confident learners. They play well with and alongside others for sustained lengths of time. Children cooperate well, share ideas and are well involved in imaginary and creative play. Teachers promote children&rsquo;s independence and group play. Children have a good sense of belonging and are confident to approach others and communicate their preferences and needs.</p><h4>Teaching strategies</h4><p align="left">Teachers use a range of effective and inclusive teaching strategies that build on children&rsquo;s learning. They notice and respond well to children&rsquo;s individual preferences and interests. Teachers make good use of learning conversations to extend on children&rsquo;s thinking and social skills. They make good links to children&rsquo;s home and use these to build on children&rsquo;s experiences. Children are well supported to enter groups and to become familiar with the kindergarten routines. Teachers actively take part in children&rsquo;s play. They work well together and communicate effectively.</p><h4>Learning environment</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from a wide range of activities that capture their interest and extend them. The planned programme provides for periods of uninterrupted time. Teachers foster children&rsquo;s interest in science and literacy. Children have easy access to resources that extend on their play ideas. Attractive and informative wall displays show children&rsquo;s participation in the programme. Children are actively involved in a spacious, natural outdoor area. This provides physical challenges and many opportunities to learn about the natural world, animals and sustainable practices.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h4>Assessment, planning, self review and bicultural practices</h4><p align="left">The teachers are at the early stages of developing a shared understanding and consistent approach to assessment, programme planning and self review. They now need to build on and embed the progress made and improve their documentation by more clearly:</p><ul>
<li>showing children&rsquo;s learning progress over time</li>
<li>showing linking in individual children&rsquo;s assessment information and how this is used to plan the programme.</li>
<li>describing the teaching practices they will use to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
<li>showing the impact of the planned programme on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">They also need to:</p><ul>
<li>identify the practices they will use to build on individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>consolidate new initiatives in self review so that they show the impact of review on improving teaching and learning outcomes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have made some good progress in the use of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme. The teachers and education service manager have identified, and ERO agrees, they need to continue to further integrate te reo M&#257;ori and tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The kindergarten currently has some children enrolled who have been identified as having moderate to severe special needs. The kindergarten operates as part of the association and has support through the association&rsquo;s policies and guidelines on inclusion.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s procedures guide teachers to effectively support children with moderate to severe special needs and their families. This includes a flexible approach to transitioning into the kindergarten and a range of ways teachers encourage and develop relationships with families.</p><p align="left">The teachers have well developed links with local schools that assist children and families during the transition to school process. The kindergarten has well established links with specialist support agencies that help them to meet the needs of children with moderate to severe special needs and their families.</p><p align="left">The teaching team is experienced in working with children with special education needs. They provide a welcoming and inclusive culture for all families and are strongly focussed on building positive relationships and effective communication.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-cashmere" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 2.30pm. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cashmere was extensively damaged in the February earthquake resulting in teachers and some of the children being relocated to another Kidsfirst Kindergarten in a neighbouring suburb until the middle of term two. Challenges faced due to this included in changes to operating hours, group size, and teaching team and interruption of programme development.</p><p align="left">Teachers place a strong focus on building and maintaining positive relationships with children and families. They work with children in caring and respectful ways. Families are involved in the kindergarten and make a valued contribution.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on literacy, science and creative play</li>
<li>the spacious, natural outdoor areas that encourage children to explore and be involved in physical play</li>
<li>teachers respecting children as capable and confident learners and communicators.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development. The recently appointed education service manager gives a good level of support to the kindergarten. This is having a positive impact on teaching practices and documentation.</p><p align="left">The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to support ongoing improvement are to build on recent developments in assessment, planning, self review and bicultural practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
