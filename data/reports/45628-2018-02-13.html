</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Springbank Headstart near Kerikeri, provides education and care for up to 20 children from four-and-a-half to six years of age. The centre has daily sessions from 8.30am to 3pm and operates in a converted bungalow. It shares a large rural site with, and is governed by the same board as, Springbank School and Springbank Pre School.</p><p>The school principal oversees the management of the centre. Day-to-day operations are led by the head teacher, who works collaboratively with one other teacher to deliver the curriculum. A recent change in staffing has meant that the centre is in a transitional phase.</p><p>The service's philosophy encourages children to work at their own pace, build their knowledge and develop their personal skills. A priority is for children to develop a love of learning and a strong academic foundation.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report was highly affirming of children's learning, as well as centre governance and bicultural practices. Some of these strengths continue to be evident. This review finds that more work is needed to improve the programme, curriculum management and internal evaluation so that provision and outcomes for children better reflect the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to be good readers and writers, and to develop sound understandings about mathematics. Children‚Äôs science learning is promoted well through interesting excursions and regular explorations of the large school site and local community. Children enjoy respectful relationships with their teachers and peers. Good promotion of tuakana/teina relationships is evident and supports children to develop a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children work together capably in small groups, communicate well with each other, and make suggestions about problems they are trying to solve. Most willingly participate in the daily structured group times, but are not always engaged in learning through these activities. Teachers should reflect on the extent to which this long structured session interrupts children's independent investigations, and whether the principles of the early childhood curriculum are sufficiently reflected in the programme.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children and support them to find solutions as part of their play. Children respond well to this attention and want adults to be part of their play. Teachers converse enthusiastically with children and use questions well to encourage their ideas and help them to solve problems. Teachers could now think about the impact of the frequent use of worksheets on children's creativity, and the extent to which the structured programme supports children to lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers' planning, assessment and evaluation lack coherence. Planning for the structured part of the day is detailed, with very little opportunity for children's spontaneous learning through play. Learning stories do not provide parents with information about the strengths and interests of the individual child, but focus more on group experiences. Evaluation is mostly informal and not well documented.</p><p>Using <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> teachers could evaluate current programme planning and assessment practices, which should contribute to greater cohesion in curriculum management. Some development is evident in implementing teaching practices that promote bicultural understandings and a greater familiarity with the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. These good teaching practices should continue to be strenghtened.</p><p>The head teacher provides sound leadership on a day-to-day basis. An evaluation of this position should include consideration of the role of the head teacher in curriculum management. Managers could use appropriately qualified early childhood practitioners to appraise personnel in this role and further grow professional learning. These actions are likely to bring about sustained improvement in the programme and in the quality of the service this centre provides.</p><p>Centre staff have strong relationships with parents and whƒÅnau, and acknowledge their role as primary caregivers and partners in children's learning. There are many ways for parents to be part of their children's learning including sharing their expertise and interests. Managers regularly seek feedback from parents.</p><p>Strengthening internal evaluation would enable the board to gain a wider perspective and ensure that policy review reflects changes in legal requirements. The board should develop a strategic plan to guide and help them to monitor centre development and effectiveness. Evaluating the service's current philosophy would help the board to gauge the extent to which it is enacted in practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing leadership by supporting the head teacher role through professional mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by widening its scope and documenting the evaluation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic plan that reflects the board's focus on ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Springbank Headstart completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the centre's curriculum. To meet requirements teachers must plan, implement and evaluate programmes based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, which:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>respond to the learning interests, strengths and capabilities of enrolled children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflect an understanding of learning and development that is consistent with current research, theory, and practices in early childhood education.</p>
</li>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
