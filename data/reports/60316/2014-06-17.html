</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years Wainui Road is an early childhood service owned and managed by Kidicorp Limited. A¬†Wellington-based management team, including business manager and a professional services manager, oversee operations.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher are based on site and attend to day-to-day organisation. The service is licensed for 41 children, including 11 children aged up to two. The centre philosophy expresses educators‚Äô desire to provide high quality early childhood education for the children in their care.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers‚Äô inclusive practice supports families with diverse needs to settle into the life of the centre. Children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities are acknowledged in the programme. An ongoing focus on building understanding of bicultural values and practices is in place. Teachers have accessed up-to-date Ministry of Education resources to assist them. Children‚Äôs iwi affiliations are known and valued.</p><p>Teachers are kind and caring towards children. A range of resources is able to be freely accessed by children for much of the day. Activities are organised to promote their interest and participation. Teachers take part in children‚Äôs play and support their emerging ideas and interests. At times, timetabled routines can interrupt children‚Äôs sustained play and teachers‚Äô engagement with individuals. Teachers should increase opportunities to engage meaningfully with children.</p><p>Provision for infants and toddlers is well supported by an appropriate range of learning materials within a well-organised environment. While close relationships are developed with particular staff, further consideration should be given to increasing opportunities for children to work consistently with familiar staff. Focused professional development around best practice provision for this age group should support an enhanced approach.</p><p>The Kidicorp ‚ÄòBe School Ready‚Äô is designed to support children prepare for school. The centre has taken steps to improve its transition-to-school processes and recognises that further development is required.</p><p>Since the August 2011 ERO report teachers have worked collaboratively to develop their assessment and programme planning processes to promote consistency and improve learning outcomes for children. They reflectively trial different planning approaches that take into consideration the variety of needs of infants and toddlers, and the differing requirements of older children.</p><p>Teachers are supported by ongoing professional development. The current focus is on developing teachers' understanding of how best to notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs learning. Continuing to deepen teachers‚Äô understandings of how to nurture and grow children‚Äôs learning is recognised as an ongoing next step. Further clarifying these understandings should support improved practice and positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Attractively presented portfolios outline children‚Äôs participation in centre activities and reflect their developing personalities, interests and preferred ways of learning. Teachers endeavour to identify each child‚Äôs strengths, interests and emerging ideas. Identifying appropriate strategies to extend children‚Äôs learning is a useful next step, in the ongoing development of these records.</p><p>Staff formally and informally seek parents‚Äô ideas and input to discover what is of importance to them in relation to their children‚Äôs learning. Continuing to actively develop authentic partnerships with whƒÅnau should support staff to meet Kidicorp‚Äôs vision of working together to enable children to reach their learning potential.</p><p>Self review is valued as a means of promoting improvement. The development of a vision and a strategic plan for the centre should help teachers to better target ongoing priority areas. A key next step is to align formal review with agreed priorities. This is likely to clarify decision making about aspects of practice requiring improvement. It is timely for staff to undertake their planned review of the philosophy statement and to consider how effectively they are meeting their ideals.</p><p>Centre appraisal involves teachers in self reflection and provides affirming feedback about development goals. Managers plan to have more frequent individual meetings with teachers. These should focus on strengthening teacher effectiveness through raising the quality of feedback they receive.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers, staff and ERO agree on the following next steps, to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to deepen partnerships with whƒÅnau</li>
<li>continue professional development in planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>develop a centre strategic plan</li>
<li>further developing understanding of self review practices and review the centre philosophy</li>
<li>implement plans to strengthen appraisal</li>
<li>explore best practice provision for infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Wainui Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years Wainui Road will be in three years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="">Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>17 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
