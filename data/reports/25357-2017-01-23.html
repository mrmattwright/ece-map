</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Millennium, in Ellerslie, is licensed to provide education and care for 85 children, including up to 25 children aged under two years. Infants and toddlers each have their own play space. The two preschool rooms share their outdoor play area. Parents have the option of enrolling their children for sessional hours or full days.</p><p>The service operates in an office complex. Some children enrolled live in the residential community but most have parents who work in the complex or neighbouring businesses. The multicultural nature of the community is reflected in the teaching team.</p><p>The Evolve Education Group took ownership of the service in December 2014. The change of ownership did not negatively impact the teaching team, which has remained stable. The current centre director was appointed to a full time position in August of this year. She is supported by a team of four head teachers, and five other qualified teachers.</p><p>The philosophy of the service focuses on inclusion and respect for diversity. Respectful relationships with children and their whānau are recognised as the foundation on which to build an environment that supports children's learning. The layout and resourcing of the physical environment provide children with space to explore at their own pace and lead their own learning.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified busy, articulate, confident, and socially competent children, who were well supported by their teachers to become creative thinkers and independent learners. The environment and the development of early literacy skills were acknowledged as strengths, and children's interests were well used in programme planning. These positive aspects have been maintained. ERO suggested strengthening self review, policies and processes for transitioning children, the alignment of strategic planning with the philosophy, and the inclusion of parent contributions in the programme. There has been good progress in these areas. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy is very evident in the programme. Children freely explore the environment, investigating ideas and resources. Older children share their developing knowledge of the world with each other and teachers. Children are confident, articulate and have fun.</p><p>Teachers know and respect children's preferences and personalities. They support them to be self-managing, independent and to make decisions. Home languages are used with children and their whānau, supporting a sense of belonging at the centre and affirming children's identity, language and culture.</p><p>Teachers support children to be socially competent, respectful of the environment and of each other. The programme for infants and toddlers moves at a gentle pace in peaceful environments. Children's decisions about their individual routines and their daily programme are invited and respected.</p><p>Teachers genuinely listen to children, and use what they have learnt to build positive, sensitive and respectful relationships. They respond to children's interests in a variety of ways and encourage complexity in their learning through skilful questioning. Teamwork is evident throughout the centre.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO expressed their appreciation of the teachers and the individualised programme provided for their children. They particularly enjoyed how teachers communicated with them, sharing the learning and development of each child.</p><p>An effective process of recording and responding to children's interests and strengths is highly visible and drives the programme. Evaluation of the programme shows teacher reflection and growth. <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is well embedded. Literacy and numeracy concepts are woven throughout centre programmes in meaningful ways.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are visible in the centre and teaching practice. Teachers use te reo in conversation with children, and use karakia and waiata appropriately and respectfully. The teaching team are now considering ways to extend and develop their knowledge of te ao Māori perspectives and how these can be more evident in their programmes.</p><p>The recent appointment of the centre director has been successful in lifting teaching practice and building a cohesive team. Strong leadership is driving a clear vision and inspiring team leaders. The current leadership structure is building capable leaders in internal evaluation and effective mentoring. An effective process of internal evaluation is in place and well supported by research. Relevant topics are chosen and the perspectives of children, whānau and teachers are invited and included.</p><p>Evolve provides up to date policies and procedures that guide practice. They also provide support personnel in the areas of business and curriculum. Individual centres are expected to develop strategic and annual plans to support the achievement of strategic goals. There are good links between this centre's strategic plan, internal evaluation and teacher appraisal. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the establishment of quality indicators around strategic goals and a system to monitor progress towards the achievement of these goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop ways to help children to understand the diverse cultures of Aotearoa and to experience success in their own language, culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Millennium completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Millennium will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 January 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
