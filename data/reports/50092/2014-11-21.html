</table><p>Bubbles New Plymouth Junior Centre requires further development in teaching practices, leadership and management and systems to be well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bubbles New Plymouth Junior is a privately owned full day education and care service in central New Plymouth. It is one of three centres on the central city site that come under the Bubbles umbrella.</p><p>Centre owners are responsible for governance and management of the centre. A programme manager (PM) is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the preschool with support from an operations manager. Teachers are qualified in early childhood education and most have been at the centre for some time.</p><p>The centre philosophy has a focus on children’s holistic development in an environment that promotes fun, children's self-help skills and independence. Teachers seek to work in partnership with parents and families.</p><p>ERO's 2011 report identified a number of areas for development and review. Many continue to require improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven education and care service reviews in the Bubbles organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have an appropriate focus on establishing relationships with children and families. Transition processes assist children and families new to the centre and those moving to the preschool. Information is shared with families.</p><p>The environment has a range of resources available for promoting children's literacy and numeracy learning. An increasing emphasis on the use of te reo Māori and experiences that reflect te ao Māori results in opportunities for children to learn about Aotearoa/New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. A next step is to make use <em>of Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success</em> and <em>Tātaiako, Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori learners</em> to be more responsive to Māori children’s cultural, language and identity.</p><p>Children are confident to approach adults. They are familiar with centre routines and expectations. Children take turns and share ideas with each other. Teachers make some links to home in their conversations with children. Some children are involved in play for sustained periods. Improving the consistency and use of strategies to support and extend children’s learning, language and sustained play are key next steps.</p><p>The curriculum requires further development. A review of the centre philosophy is ongoing and is timely. Teachers and managers are inquiring into how well the philosophy is reflected in experiences for children. The review should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing shared understanding of high quality interactions that build on and extend children’s language and thinking</li>
<li>centre routines that reflect current and best practice in early childhood education.</li>
</ul><p>There have been some developments to centre processes and policies. Some of these require strengthening, including assessment, programme planning and annual planning. The strategic vision is yet to sufficiently focus on priorities for improving teaching and learning.</p><p>Governance and management processes to support and build teaching capability need to be improved. A priority is to fully address the areas for review and development identified in ERO's 2011 report. Appraisal needs to align with the Registered Teacher Criteria. Opportunities for centre leaders to inquire into and improve their leadership are an important next step to strengthen outcomes for children.</p><p>Self review continues to be an area for development. The owners, managers and teachers need to distinguish between reviewing for accountability and evaluating for improvement. Developing robust ways of knowing the impact of teaching practices and policies on children’s learning and development should lead to improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The Bubbles 2014-to-2015 management plan requires strengthening. The focus of the plan is on centre operations and a broad teaching and learning objective for the seven centres. Consideration should be given to developing a plan collaboratively with teachers and parents that identifies priorities and associated goals to strengthen individual centre operations. This should include governors and managers developing a better understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has yet to fully address the areas for development identified in the 2011 ERO report. Owners, managers, and teachers should improve and develop their understanding and practices in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>self review to more clearly show the impact of teachers’ practices and learning on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment and programme planning, including how this information is used to plan for and extend individual children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual and strategic planning to better inform centre priorities for teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a shared understanding of high quality interactions that build on and extend children’s language and thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening appraisal processes, including a focus on appropriate leadership goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bubbles New Plymouth Junior Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and the provision of an effective early childhood education for children. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, in particular review practices, appraisal, strategic and annual planning.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the practices of adults providing education and care demonstrate an understanding of children’s development and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Service 2008, C4]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, centre management should make sure that all non-registered personnel, including managers and volunteers, are police vetted every three years.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bubbles New Plymouth Junior Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>21 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
