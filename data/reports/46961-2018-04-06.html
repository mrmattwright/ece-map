</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Paraparaumu is a newly established, purpose-built centre, operated by Evolve Education Group Ltd (Evolve). It was purchased from its previous owner in 2017. The service is licensed for a maximum of 94 children, including 24 aged up to two years. At the time of this review there were 101 children enrolled from a diverse range of ethnic groups, 21 are Māori, and nine of Pacific heritage.</p><p>Governance and management are provided by Evolve. An area manager guides professional practice and centre development.</p><p>The centre manager began in this position in March 2017. Newly created head teacher and curriculum facilitator roles have been established in response to roll growth.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy reflects the unique culture, teaching team beliefs and centre values.</p><p>There are four age related learning spaces comprising infants (Kiwi), toddlers (Fantail), preschool 1 (Tui) and preschool 2 (Kea).<em></em></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong teacher practice clearly enacts the centre philosophy. Teachers work collaboratively and are highly responsive to children's strengths, interests and needs. They skilfully support children's growing social and emotional competence and development.</p><p>Children are engaged, confident learners. Teachers purposefully build positive learning relationships with parents and whānau, supporting a sense of belonging and wellbeing for children and their families. Teachers are positive, warm and respectful in their interactions with children. They maintain high levels of awareness of each child's participation.</p><p>The centre is a well-resourced, high quality learning environment with an emphasis on environmental sustainability. Children are well supported to initiate their own learning. Events and local excursions are used well to extend learning.</p><p>Care routines are flexible to infants' and toddlers' preferences and needs. An emphasis on nature-based learning, physical challenge and sensory play is evident. Children freely access learning resources.</p><p>A well-considered review of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle is being developed. Relevant research and professional learning informs planning improvements that are focused to better promote learning partnerships with whānau and children. </p><p>Implementation of a bicultural curriculum is in the beginning stages. The centre uses the expertise of teachers through waiata, action songs, pepeha and karakia to support children's language and identity. Priority should be given to continuing to support development and implementation of teaching practices and strategies that promote and support Māori children to achieve success as Māori.</p><p>Some home languages are supported through effective strategies that enable parents and children to engage with the learning community. Leaders have identified and ERO's evaluation supports, the need to build teacher capability and understanding of culturally responsive practice to respond more effectively to children from Pacific and other cultures.   </p><p>Teachers use research to carefully consider transitions into and through the centre that support children and whānau. Some useful practices promote continuity of learning. Networking with local school staff supports transition.</p><p>A useful approach to meaningful internal evaluation effectively informs teacher practice and leads to centre wide improvements. This is a centre strength.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are well supported through a sound appraisal process that supports them to grow their capability. External and internal professional learning and development effectively informs teacher practice. Leaders have identified the need to strengthen teachers' understanding and implementation of inquiry, to support them to reflect on their effectiveness and promote positive learning outcomes for targeted children. ERO's external evaluation confirms this as a next step.</p><p>Evolve managers are highly supportive of centre developments. The recently established leadership team is highly very effectively in promoting a positive teaching and learning environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that priority should be given to continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a more responsive curriculum that promotes educational success for Māori, Pacific and other learners</li>
<li>develop and implement an agreed system to document assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen teacher inquiry into the effectiveness of practice on outcomes for children.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Paraparaumu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Paraparaumu will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>6 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
