<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The parent group at Hororata Playcentre focuses on providing a friendly and welcoming environment for children and families. They are well placed, with the support and expertise of the local playcentre association, to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Hororata Playcentre is one of 46 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The association&rsquo;s education and centre support teams provide effective support to the centre. The parent cooperative is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the playcentre. A coordinator is employed to oversee and enhance the curriculum that parents provide. The playcentre is an established part of the rural community and is open for two mornings each week. Older children and younger children, including siblings, have many opportunities to play and learn together. Parents remain on session with their children and build community support networks and friendships with one another. The playcentre philosophy is strongly reflected in the operation of the centre.</p><p>The parent group told ERO that playcentre has provided a safe and supportive place for families during the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children benefit from positive relationships with adults and each other. Adults are responsive to children&rsquo;s individual needs and interests. They are actively involved in children&rsquo;s play and encourage children&rsquo;s independence and self-help skills. Adults engage children in conversations and activities that support the development of oral language and social skills. Children play well with and alongside others for long periods of time. ERO observed children and adults having fun together.</p><p>The child-focused programme promotes children&rsquo;s confidence and sense of belonging. Children enjoy extended periods of uninterrupted time to freely explore and develop their own ideas within a well resourced programme. Adults provide well organised and purposeful learning spaces that reflect children&rsquo;s current interests and encourage their curiosity and investigation. Children have many opportunities to be involved in a wide range of physical challenges in a spacious, natural outdoor area. Trips into the wider community enhance the programme offered to children.</p><p>The parent group is actively engaged in the life of the playcentre. Parents use a range of effective strategies to communicate clearly with one another about the centre expectations and events. Attractive and purposeful wall displays provide useful information to guide parents in writing stories for children. Well-presented profile books contain regular contributions from parents and other adults about children&rsquo;s interests and participation in a wide range of learning experiences.</p><p>The wellbeing of infants and toddlers has been carefully considered by the parent group when they upgraded the under-two area recently.</p><p>The parent group has strong links with the community including local schools and other early childhood centres. A good relationship between the closest school and the playcentre has resulted in a positive transition-to-school process for children and families.</p><p>The centre support person and coordinator provide good support and leadership for the parent group. The parent group makes good use of the valued strengths and skills that individual parents bring to the playcentre.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The parent group has made some recent progress since the 2009 ERO review. Some new systems have been introduced to guide the recording of assessment, programme planning and evaluation and self review. In order to improve learning outcomes for children, the parent group has identified, and ERO agrees, that it should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>what children&rsquo;s individual learning priorities are</li>
<li>the next steps adults will take to extend on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>how children&rsquo;s progress is evaluated over time</li>
<li>the understanding and use of self review by all parents.</li>
</ul><p>The parent group also agrees that it should continue to increase the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the centre practices and in documentation.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Hororata Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>31 October 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
