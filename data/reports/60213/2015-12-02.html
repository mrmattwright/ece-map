</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ngaio Childcare Centre Inc is a community based early childhood service, governed by a committee made up of parents whose children attend the centre. The centre caters for up to 16 children at any one time and five may be aged up to two years.</p><p>The philosophy guiding teaching and learning emphasises the importance of positive, responsive relationships supporting children to learn through their play, in a small group setting.</p><p>The leadership structure of the service has recently changed from two co-leaders to a head teacher having overall responsibility.</p><p>The service has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming. They know the children and their families well. They actively promote children‚Äôs social and emotional competence through working alongside them, engaging in conversations and offering choices. A sense of belonging is effectively promoted. Relationships with children and their families are respectful and responsive.</p><p>The programme effectively follows children‚Äôs acknowledged interests. Their developing language is well supported by teachers who skilfully extend conversations and consciously model and build vocabulary. Children learn through their self selected play in a calm environment.</p><p>Group planning seeks to support the broad ranging interests of children. The teachers‚Äô approach requires further development. The identification of clearly stated learning intentions should assist with clarity. Regular evaluation, focused on the impact of the programme on children‚Äôs learning, should inform ongoing planning.</p><p>Transitions into and out of the centre are well considered. A key teacher supports young children to settle. Routines are consistently implemented giving children a sense of security.</p><p>Bicultural practices are emphasised at group times. Teachers should consider how to integrate te reo MƒÅori me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori across the curriculum. They should also follow up on parents‚Äô aspirations for their children and increase their understanding of families‚Äô languages, cultures and identities.</p><p>Teachers show a strong commitment to enacting the philosophy. Positive working relationships are evident between staff, parents and the committee. With the change of centre leadership structure, it is timely to explore ways to build leadership capacity in curriculum design and implementation, self review and appraisal.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and value self review. Further developing the understanding and use of internal evaluation should strengthen their understanding of what works well and inform plans for the future.</p><p>Regular appraisal occurs for all staff. This process should be strengthened through teachers having clearer goals focused on their teaching and regular, formal observations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>improving appraisal</li>
<li>building leadership capacity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ngaio Childcare Centre Inc completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ngaio Childcare Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>2 December 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup>
