</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puataunofo Aoga Amata is a community-based service located in Ranui in the West of Auckland. This service provides a bilingual setting with a strong emphasis on gagana Samoa (Samoan language) and aganu‚Äôu Samoa (Samoan culture), and promote a Christian perspective and values. The service caters for children from birth to school age. Children from a predominantly Samoan cultural background attend for all-day care and education.</p><p>The service is governed by the Ranui Youth in Action Trust Board and a management committee consisting of the licensees, the supervisor and an elected parent representative. Since the 2011 ERO review the trust board has employed an experienced and skilled supervisor to lead and manage the centre. The competent teaching team reflect the ethnic diversity of their local community. The aoga supports teachers to study for teaching qualifications. Trustees, staff and parents are committed to promoting the Samoan language and culture.</p><p>The supervisor is very experienced and has led the development of areas identified for improvement in the 2011 report. She sets high expectations for herself and staff and ensures the aoga maintains its strong core values and cultural identity.</p><p>The spacious outdoor environment is attractive and promotes the values and culture the aoga. Children are encouraged to choose indoor and outdoor activities and enjoy mixed aged play.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in the programme and play well independently and in small groups. They enjoy interacting with adults and express their ideas confidently. Infants and toddlers freely make choices about their play. They are curious, and many enjoy sustained interactions with each other and with the activities. Children demonstrate respectful relationships with each other and with teachers. They proudly reflect their Samoan identity and benefit from a strong sense of belonging to this aoga.</p><p>Mixed aged play allows for tuakana-teina relationships to form. Children are constantly interacting with adults and negotiate their play with each other. Through a strong duty of care, teachers make themselves available for children. Children are surrounded with displays that promote their culture, language and identity.</p><p>Teachers at the aoga are fluent in Gagana Samoa and actively model this for children. They have established an atmosphere that promotes family values, based on Aganu‚Äôu Samoa cultural and Christian perspectives. They know the children and the families well and work very well together as a team. They have built well established relationships and support each other to provide a quality programme for children.</p><p>Puataunofo is an aoga of choice for parents. There is a high turnout at monthly fono from parents who are committed to building strong partnerships with the aoga and promote its vision and values. Parents relate well to each other due to being part of the larger church network. Their aspirations for children‚Äôs learning are highly evident in documented written feedback.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum is becoming more responsive to children‚Äôs emerging interests. It is documented and evaluated by staff. Parents are invited to contribute to the programme and their input is celebrated and valued. Teachers should now embed effective ways to respond to ongoing children‚Äôs emerging interests. They could also benefit from developing ongoing inquiry and reflections about their practice.</p><p>The aoga‚Äôs trust board and management committee provide very good governance for the aoga. Their vision is based on their collective shared cultural values underpinned by the aoga‚Äôs philosophy. Samoan values and Christian beliefs provide a sense of shared purpose and underpin all relationships between stakeholders.</p><p>The aoga is very well led by an experienced supervisor who works collaboratively with staff on the daily operations of the centre. She seeks to build high expectations for teachers and optimal learning experiences for children. ERO and the supervisor agree that she could seek professional mentoring to support her leadership role.</p><p>There are opportunities for teachers to attend professional learning and development workshops and implement this learning in programmes. Staff have used self review processes to significantly improve the outdoor area so it strongly reflects the Samoan heritage of the children and their families. Managers should now develop a robust teacher appraisal system that meets the Education Council‚Äôs requirements for the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em>.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>revising and updating key policies</li>
<li>using self review processes to further refine and document assessment planning and evaluation for better outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puataunofo Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puataunofo Aoga Amata will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
