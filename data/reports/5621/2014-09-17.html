</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tuakau Kindergarten is a well established service that operates on a site adjacent to the local primary school in the small rural town of Tuakau. It draws children from a wide surrounding area and is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children over two years of age. The kindergarten offers a kindergarten day model, which allows children to attend sessions that match school hours. Many children attend on selected days during the week. About half the children attending the centre are of MƒÅori heritage, and about half are of NZ European descent. There are also a small number of children with Pacific heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs four registered teachers are supported by a qualified teacher aide. One teacher is new since the last review. Some have served the kindergarten for many years, creating a stable foundation for teamwork. The teaching team has established cohesive practices with a focus on providing innovative programmes to engage children‚Äôs interest.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô vision statement for the kindergarten focuses on enriching children‚Äôs relationships with papatuanuku and providing a sustainable, nurturing environment. This vision is apparent in the programme choices for children and in the experiences provided by teachers.</p><p>Teachers have made progress in addressing the areas for development identified in ERO‚Äôs 2010 report. They have strengthened their understanding of self review and formed stronger links with the community. Teachers‚Äô participation in professional learning about te reo MƒÅori is helping to strengthen their relationships with children.</p><p>Redevelopment of the outdoor area has provided children with improved challenges and great opportunities to develop skills. The changes to the environment contribute to children‚Äôs learning about nature and sustainability.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association.</p><p>The Associations‚Äô values, strategic goals and mission statement provide clear guidance for the kindergarten. A sound governance framework, management systems and professional personnel support kindergarten operations. A professional practice manager (PPM) provides management leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The Association provides regular professional development opportunities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs sense of ownership and belonging in the centre is strong. They settle easily to play, work cooperatively, and share goals with their friends. Children select their own play from a wide range of available activities and show high levels of competence in their ability to manage their day.</p><p>Children confidently communicate and engage well in new learning opportunities. They are capable learners and eagerly share knowledge of their own learning. They benefit from some high quality conversations with teachers that foster their learning and thinking skills.</p><p>Playing games and listening to stories is helping to lay good foundations for children‚Äôs literacy and numeracy learning. They dramatise stories they are familiar with and enjoy presenting plays for their friends. The environment is print rich, and includes opportunities for children to read and creatively explore drawing and writing.</p><p>Children are taken in groups on a weekly basis to explore a natural bush area in the local community. Working out how to catch eels, climbing trees and learning to abseil have been popular parts of the bush experience. This new addition to the programme is having a positive effect on children‚Äôs confidence, thinking and physical abilities. It complements other aspects of learning about nature and sustainability that are included in the daily programme.</p><p>Development of the outdoor area has enabled teachers to further focus on sustainability by creating natural features in the playground and opportunities to learn about recycling. The kindergarten‚Äôs involvement in the Enviroschools programme has spearheaded these developments and has provided a link to tikanga MƒÅori values and practices.</p><p>The indoor area also provides children with interesting experiences and resources to explore. Teachers value children‚Äôs work and centre displays celebrate children‚Äôs participation in previous experiences.</p><p>Teachers know children well and use children‚Äôs individual assessment portfolios to capture significant moments in their learning and to provide insights for parents about the programme. They have a variety of processes for regularly reviewing their practices and programmes for children. They continue to review their assessment and planning processes with the aim of increasing the effectiveness and manageability of these processes. More focused, in-depth teacher planning and self review should further increase children‚Äôs engagement in extended learning. It would also be useful for teachers to review the effectiveness of the programme in supporting and diversifying children‚Äôs learning as a result of what they add to the programme.</p><p>Professional development supports teachers‚Äô knowledge of, and confidence in using, te reo MƒÅori in the programme with children. With the growth of MƒÅori families attending the kindergarten, work to strengthen their understanding of te Ao MƒÅori is timely. Teachers should also continue efforts to consult with families/whƒÅnau about their aspirations for their children to further guide planning for the centre programme.</p><p>Association systems for strategic planning and self review are well established and effective. Teachers and whƒÅnau have opportunities to contribute to these processes. The PPM knows the kindergarten very well, provides responsive and professional support for teachers, and continually promotes high quality teaching and learning. The PPM regularly reports to the General Manager about the kindergarten‚Äôs progress.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô individual strengths are valued by the PPM. The Association‚Äôs performance appraisal processes are well established and have recently been adapted to enhance support for the ongoing growth and development of staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the managers agree that next key steps for the teaching team are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using self-review processes linked to teaching and learning to identify and build children‚Äôs extended learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening links with the MƒÅori community, embedding ngƒÅ tikanga and developing understandings of te Ao MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the focus on sustainability practices to extend children‚Äôs and their own understanding of ways for maintaining environments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To enhance its management practices, the Association could consider making more deliberate connections between the kindergarten‚Äôs and Association‚Äôs self review and long-term planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tuakau Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tuakau Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
