<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Kids to Five on Somerset governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the November 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>leadership and management</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>environment, organisation and resources that encourage child-led learning</li>
<li>routines to support children&rsquo;s social competence.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five on Somerset is located in the Hamilton suburb of Frankton. The centre is owned by, and operates under, the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. It is licensed to cater for 50 children up to school age, including up to 25 aged under two years old. Approximately one third of children on the roll are identified as M&#257;ori. Children learn and are cared for in three age-based play areas: nursery, toddlers and pre-school. Opportunities for flexible and supervised movement between designated areas allow children to play with siblings and friends in other age groups when they wish to do so.</p><p>The 2012 ERO review found that positive parent partnerships were a feature of the service and there were many other areas of good performance, particularly in the nursery and toddlers&rsquo; areas. However, the centre was operating under a transitional licence and there were concerns about the quality of education for pre-school children.</p><p>Since July 2012, there have been changes in teaching staff including the appointment of a new manager and assistant manager. The centre is now fully licensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. Teachers have undertaken extensive professional development in the areas of self review, improving learning environments, and teaching and assessment practices. The manager and assistant manager have received useful leadership training from Kidicorp Ltd.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Centre managers and teachers, are very well supported by Kidicorp&rsquo;s professional services and business managers. They have made very positive progress in addressing the areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO review.</p><h4>Leadership and management</h4><p>The experienced and knowledgeable manager and assistant manager have successfully focused on building a collaborative teaching team. They model effective teaching practice and have established meaningful self-review practices which strongly influence a momentum of continuous improvement. Appraisal processes have improved so that teachers now receive regular constructive feedback about their teaching practice from centre and Kidicorp managers. Centre leaders have maintained positive and meaningful partnerships for learning with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Assessment, planning and evaluation</h4><p>Teachers have strengthened their understanding and use of effective assessment, planning, and evaluation practices and these are well monitored. They make good use of assessment information to guide planning for groups and individual children. They continue to provide opportunities for parents to engage in the centre programme through attractive wall displays of programme planning and readily accessible individual profile books. Positive features of assessment practice include:</p><ul>
<li>identifying how children learn and showing progress over time in profile books</li>
<li>including bicultural perspectives</li>
<li>recording and using children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; voices</li>
<li>making appropriate links to aspects of <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> for children in the pre-school area to assist transition to school.</li>
</ul><h4>Environment organisation and resources that encourage child-led learning</h4><p>There has been significant review and development of the centre&rsquo;s learning environment and increased access to equipment and activities that promote child-led learning. Teachers make good use of available space to ensure that a wide range of learning experiences and physical challenges are readily available. Good quality, age-appropriate resources support children&rsquo;s exploration and problem solving. Consideration should now also be given to reviewing the organisation of the preschool and toddlers&rsquo; areas to maximise access to all appropriate resources for these children.</p><h4>Routines to support children&rsquo;s social competence</h4><p>Centre managers have undertaken an extensive review of meal and snack times in the over-two areas and made significant changes to these routines. Flexible morning and afternoon tea times in the preschool room now enable children to sustain engagement in meaningful play. Well-managed lunch times provide opportunities for children to engage in relaxed social conversations with teachers and peers. Mat times promote a sense of family/whanaungatanga and are used effectively to promote ready-for-school expectations, including literacy skills. These routines continue to be reviewed.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps for further improvement are to continue developing:</p><ul>
<li>te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori practices</li>
<li>consistent assessment and teaching practices across the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>21 November 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
