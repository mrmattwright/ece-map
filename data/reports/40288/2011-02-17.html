Findings</h2><h3>Strategic Management and self review</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Accel Early Childhood Centre previously known as Bambini Educare for Under 5‚Äôs provides care and education for children from birth to five. In April 2010 the centre was taken over by new management and relicensed. Management took immediate steps to develop and define policy and procedures for centre operations, work with teachers to create a philosophy for education and prioritise and address immediate concerns with the environment. Since that time a significant changeover of staff, families and children has occurred. The centre‚Äôs newly developed philosophy aims to provide a child-initiated and emergent programme for children. In addition, there is a focus on moving from a mixed age group of under and over two-year-olds to providing a programme for over two‚Äôs.</p><p>In 2009 under the previous ownership ERO identified a number of significant issues that were affecting the quality of management, programme and compliance matters. This ERO supplementary review evaluates the centre‚Äôs progress towards addressing the areas for improvement outlined in the report. The terms of reference cover:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning, self review and quality assurance systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation, learning environment, interactions and the inclusion of a MƒÅori dimension into the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Strategic planning, self review and quality assurance</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The new owners and licensee are knowledgeable about and experienced in quality early childhood education and care. They have provided focused professional leadership and are establishing a sound strategic direction for the centre. The owners/managers have worked hard to redevelop the centre as a viable and functional education and care service. Matters that have been addressed include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>development and implementation of a detailed strategic and annual plan that is linked to the Desirable Objectives and Practices (DOP‚Äôs) and supporting their progress to meeting the new licensing criteria;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>introduction of a useful self-review system that has become a frequent part of management discussions and staff meetings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishment of an appraisal process that is being used to increasingly provide relevant and meaningful advice and guidance to teachers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementation of quality assurance practices that identify hazards and ensure adequate monitoring of health and safety matters.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><p>While management has made significant changes and made good progress towards improving the operational facilities it is important that managers and teachers work together to further embed and sustain ongoing centre development.</p><p>¬†</p><h3>Quality of Education</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Management has successfully focused on rebuilding the centre roll and developing relationships with new families, the local school and community. Teachers have developed a relevant philosophy that underpins their teaching practice, which has resulted in the strengthening of the learning programme for children. Significant features contributing to the improvement of the quality of education are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the new teaching team who are working effectively together to implement useful assessment and planning practices that are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers working collaboratively to build positive and respectful relationships with children and using what they notice about children to increasingly guide and inform their conversations and interactions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the reorganisation of the indoor and outdoor environments to increase children‚Äôs access to a wider range of learning areas and resources. This allows children to pursue their interests and enables teachers to extend learning, particularly in oral language and aspects of literacy and numeracy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that children‚Äôs learning is made visible by the effective display of art work, use of digital photos of children at play and readily accessible learning journals; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>management‚Äôs commitment to the inclusion of MƒÅori children in the centre through initiatives to increase accessibility, participation and consultation for MƒÅori children and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the last review ERO has identified that there has been a noticeable improvement in the interactions and environment that has strengthened the quality of education and care for children and their families.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>At the time of this review ongoing improvement to the indoor learning environment is still required. While management has made immediate changes to the organisation and resourcing of learning areas, the existing building issues remain a barrier to long-term improvements. Addressing these issues is likely to bring about the identified improvements to learning opportunities for children. As well, ongoing self review about the resources, teaching practices and refinement of assessment, planning and evaluation should further strengthen the quality of teaching and learning programme.</p><p>¬†</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><ul>
<li>management continues to seek Ministry of Education support to bring about changes to the facilities and ensure the centre meets all regulatory requirements under the ECE regulations and criteria of 2008 including the learning environment and aspects of health and safety; and</li>
<li>management continues to undertake professional development to support teachers‚Äô interactions and further development of assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>

The centre was previously known as Bambini Educare for Under 5‚Äôs. In April 2010 the centre was relicensed and taken over by new management. Managers took immediate steps to develop and define policy and procedures for centre operations, work with teachers to create a philosophy for education and prioritise and address immediate concerns with the environment. Since that time a significant changeover of staff, families and children has occurred.</p><p>This review evaluates the centre‚Äôs progress towards addressing the areas for improvement outlined in the 2009 Education Review report. The terms of reference cover:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning, self review and quality assurance systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation, learning environment, interactions and the inclusion of a Maori dimension into the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new owners and licensee are knowledgeable and experienced in early childhood education and care. They provide focused professional leadership and are establishing a sound strategic direction for the centre. They have redeveloped the centre as a viable and functional education and care service.</p><p>Management and teachers have been working hard to rebuild the centre roll and develop positive and respectful relationships with new families, the local school and the community. Teachers have developed a relevant philosophy that underpins their teaching practice, which has resulted in the strengthening of learning programme for children. Further embedding self-review practices in relation to resources, teaching practices and refinement of assessment, planning and evaluation should further strengthen the quality of the teaching and learning programme.</p><p>While management has made immediate changes to the organisation and resourcing of learning areas, the existing building issues remain a barrier to long-term improvements. Addressing these issues is likely to bring about the required improvements to learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Since the previous review ERO has identified that there has been a noticeable improvement in the interactions and environment that has strengthened the quality of education and care for children and their families.</p><h3>Future Action <b><br></b></h3><p>Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p>
