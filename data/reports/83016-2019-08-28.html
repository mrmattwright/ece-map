</table><p>Big Steps Educare Inc¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Big Steps Educare Inc is a rural, early childhood service that provides education and care for up to 35 children, including 10 aged up to two years. It is located in Waikouaiti and operates from 6.30am to 6.30pm, Monday to Friday.</p><p>The service's valued outcomes focus on children to be curious, respectful, and interdependent and explorers of their world. The philosophy values the importance of close, respectful relationships between the service, tamariki and their whƒÅnau and connections with the wider community.</p><p>The day-to-day operations of the centre are managed by the centre manager. Staffing has remained unchanged since ERO's 2016 review. The service has responded well in addressing the recommendations from its last ERO review in 2016.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from an inclusive learning environment which supports their sense of belonging and makes their families feel welcome. The mixed-age setting supports children to develop friendships through cooperative and independent play. They are settled and engaged in their learning.</p><p>Positive relationships are evident between children and adults. Their interests, needs and preferences are well known by teachers. Teachers use this knowledge to plan activities and routines, and to adapt the learning environment to support children's learning and development.</p><p>The curriculum is broad and offers children a range of interesting and meaningful learning experiences. Early literacy is well supported by teachers, with a strong focus on building oral-language skills for children. The physical environment offers challenge and appropriate risk for children to explore and become fully involved in a wide variety of activities. Daily care routines are well managed and understood by children.</p><p>Children under three years old benefit from strong attachments with key contact teachers. High levels of care and respect support infants and toddlers to learn and develop in a safe, calm and settled environment.</p><p>A useful planning and assessment system is in place to ensure all children are planned for over time. Parent's aspirations and children‚Äôs language, culture and identity are meaningfully included. Further refinement of this will strengthen the quality and consistency of assessment for children's learning.</p><p>Teachers maintain open and ongoing communication with parents in order to know about children's changing needs. The contributions of parents and whƒÅnau are valued, sought by teachers, and regularly used for planning children's learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers respond appropriately to the interests, strengths, and capabilities of diverse groups of children. Teachers use te reo me ona tikanga MƒÅori in ways that value and recognise New Zealand's bicultural society. They participate in professional learning to further develop bicultural practices in the centre.</p><p>The service has well established connections within the wider community. Partnerships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori have continued to strengthen over time. This has positively contributed to the development of a working relationship with the local runanga and marae.</p><p>The centre and their families have strong reciprocal links with the local school. Children benefit from well planned and positive transitions into, through and beyond the centre. Teachers foster children's friendships to enhance their security and confidence at settling in and transition times.</p><p>The centre manager provides ongoing professional and collegial support to all staff. Teachers benefit from a shared leadership approach which supports professional practice and grows their capability. Professional learning is identified and prioritised by the centre manager and staff.</p><p>The parent committee has experienced membership changes following the recent annual general meeting. The outgoing committee have implemented a succession plan that will assist the new committee to develop capability and support ongoing sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Big Steps Educare Inc, and ERO agree, that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and build on assessment, planning and evaluation to strengthen the quality and consistency of assessment for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build on current bicultural practices to strengthen ongoing partnerships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and links with local runaka</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation practices to build evaluative thinking and reasoning which will help guide assessment and planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and build on the appraisal system to ensure a more cohesive and consistent approach is used for all staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Big Steps Educare Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>28 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
