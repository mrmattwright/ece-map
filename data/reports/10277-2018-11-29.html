</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coastal Kids is in the coastal community of Beachlands and is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 62 children, including up to 20 under the age of two years. The centre has separate rooms for infants (Tui), toddlers (Kea Forest), and older children (Pukeko Preschoolers).</p><p>The centre is led by a manager and one head Kaiako. These appointments have been made since the 2015 ERO report. The stable team of staff includes seven qualified kaiako and one teacher in training. There is a mix of permanent and casual kaiako.</p><p>Leaders and kaiako aim for the centre to be a 'home-away-from-home' environment that sparks children's interests, supports their dispositions and enhances their natural curiosities and abilities. Their philosophy promotes children as competent, confident learners and communicators. It recognises the environment as the third teacher, and promotes the inclusion of te reo me onƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori<em>.</em></p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted good opportunities for children to make choices and good levels of adult support for infants and toddlers. Agreed areas for ongoing development included more robust self-review, and making programmes more responsive to children's interests and dispositions. Since the 2015 ERO report the environment has been improved, with a strong focus on natural resources. Kaiako have engaged in professional development to support their goals. They have also strengthened curriculum design and internal evaluation.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care organisation. BestStart provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support operations and curriculum in individual centres. A business manager and a professional services manager are highly involved in the staff professional development and strategic guidance.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Upper North Island (UNI) BestStart region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are capable, eager learners who lead their own play. They are confident communicators with good opportunities to share ideas and problem solve. Children have fun and experience success as learners. They are creative, imaginative and use literacy, mathematics and technologies as part of their play.</p><p>Children learn in a welcoming and exciting learning environment that promotes discovery, curiosity and hands-on learning. Thoughtfully resourced play areas invite and sustain children‚Äôs engagement in play. Wall displays and equipment reflect a respect for te ao MƒÅori and children‚Äôs learning and family backgrounds. Kaiako foster children‚Äôs understanding of science, particularly around respect and care for the natural environment. This is reflected in the way children explore and are physically active in the large landscaped outdoor area.</p><p>Kaiako recognise and build on children's strengths. Their respectful and supportive interactions build on children‚Äôs ideas, language and interests in play and discussion. Kaiako know children and families well. They affirm and value children's cultural heritage. They are inclusive and foster a strong sense of belonging in all children.</p><p>The curriculum arises from children's interests and dispositions, the centre‚Äôs philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Group planning is well established and is responsive to children, parent aspirations and community connections. The high value placed on children learning through play is evident in teachers' practices and centre documents.</p><p>Kaiako provide very good support for oral language development and encourage children to use their own home languages. They have a strong commitment to bicultural practices and have intentionally woven te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into teaching and centre practices.</p><p>Kaiako understand and provide well for the special characteristics and interests of infants and toddlers. They maintain a calm nurturing environment in which very young children have space and time to explore and play. Respectful caregiving supports infants‚Äô need for strong and secure attachments. Toddlers' need for independence and reassurance are responded to in ways that maintain the dignity of the child. Sensitive and supportive teaching practices affirm and build on each child's strengths.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolios are highly valued records of learning that are often added to by families. The introduction of online portfolios and communication has increased opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to their children‚Äôs learning. There is good support for children's transition in to the centre and on to school. Kaiako encourage partnerships with parents in ways that contribute positively to outcomes for children.</p><p>The manager is an effective pedagogical leader and manager. Ongoing teacher development is valued and supported by an effective appraisal system. Internal evaluation is well established and influences decision making. Leaders are aware that deeper reflection and evaluation would help to lift teaching practice and contribute to more positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by a strategic plan, annual plan and a shared vision. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promotes a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and supports more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Continued revisiting of the goals of the centre's strategic and annual plans is enabling leaders and teachers to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for ongoing improvement would include embedding and building on new initiatives and good practices, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more visible kaiako response to individual children's interests and continuity of learning over time in portfolios, online records and centre documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>culturally responsive teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation that encourages teacher ownership, involves deeper analysis and focuses on the effectiveness and impact of teachers' practice on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coastal Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service should develop a specific procedure and use BestStart excursion and risk assurance management systems when children leave the licensed area to use the mobile swimming pool.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coastal Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>29 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
