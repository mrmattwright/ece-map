</table><p>Kidz First Medicalcare provides high quality early childhood education and care that promotes the wellbeing and learning of all children covered by the service.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz First Medicalcare is situated in the children's medical ward of Middlemore Hospital. It caters for children admitted to the ward, and their siblings and whƒÅnau. The service is governed by the Counties Manukau Hospital Board. Daily management of the service is undertaken by the Hospital Play Specialist (HPS) team leader. Staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers and hold additional qualifications as Hospital Play Specialists (HPS).</p><p>Counties Manukau Hospital (CMH) has recently undertaken a restructure of roles and responsibilities within the hospital. An operations manager has recently been appointed to take responsibility for the HPS team. The team leader and the operations manager work collaboratively to help ensure children are provided with a high quality service.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the importance placed on developing partnership with whƒÅnau at every stage of HPS's work with children. Children's sense of wellbeing and opportunities for them to continue learning are the primary objectives of Hospital Play Specialists. They aim to promote and support children's social and emotional wellbeing at their bedsides, in treatment rooms and in the recreation room. Positive aspects from the 2012 ERO report have been sustained and recommendations acted upon. Self-review processes inform management about the effectiveness of the service.</p><p>Strategic planning for the service is in a phase of rethinking and reworking to reflect the recent changes in the service. The strategic plan will be linked to annual planning and staff performance appraisal processes on completion.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau demonstrate high levels of trust and wellbeing in the care of the HPS. Children confidently use the high quality resources and enjoy experiences provided in the recreation room and at their bedsides. They lead their own learning by making choices. The environment is attractive and plentifully resourced. The large space for play, outdoor deck space and infant corner provide opportunities for exploration and activities. Siblings and whƒÅnau are also welcome to use the recreation room.</p><p>HPS work consistently with children observing their reactions and supporting children's urgent needs and their strengths. Conversations with children seek to encourage their participation, and to discover their interests. The short stay of most children in hospital adds a complexity to the HPS role that they manage effectively. Transitions into and out of the hospital are sensitively managed by HPS in collaboration with nursing staff.</p><p>HPS bring high levels of knowledge and expertise to their work. Part of their aim is to increase children's ability to cope with separation from home, and with difficult medical procedures. They work effectively to help children and their whƒÅnau manage the unfamiliar hospital environment, and to develop a sense of belonging. Relationships are a strength of the service. HPS are respectful and inclusive at all levels.</p><p>HPS provide a curriculum underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Assessment and planning are contextually relevant, useful and recorded daily in a variety of ways. Purposeful evaluation is completed for long-stay patients and for those with special needs. WhƒÅnau are strongly influential in the programme. HPS talk with them, seeking information about children's learning experiences, personal dispositions and strategies for dealing with their medical issues.</p><p>Kidz First Medicalcare is managed by a team of highly committed HPS. Experienced and effective leadership for the team contributes to the smooth operation of the service. A newly appointed practice supervisor leads the ongoing good practice that characterises the service. The work of the operations manager is making a significant and positive difference to the profile of the service within the hospital and to the efficiency of management documentation and thinking.</p><p>The recreation room decor, resources and notices reflect the intention of the HPS team to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to increase children's awareness of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. All members of the team have attended PLD to strengthen their knowledge and familiarity with te reo MƒÅori. The team leader has identified the need for the team to increase the use of te reo MƒÅori with children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>CMHB recognises the value HPS in helping children and whƒÅnau to respond positively to hospital environments and treatments. It ensures that the Kidz First Medicalcare service receives the financial support needed to undertake its extensive work with children and their whƒÅnau. Part of this support is funding for the professional learning and development of staff to help sustain and further improve the high quality work of the HPS. Many of the policies for the service are generic to the hospital but also include those specific to the education focus expected of HPS.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service managers agree that next steps for the service are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>complete work on the strategic plan and associated links to annual planning and staff performance appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to progress the use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori with children and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
</ul><p>explore options for making the service's planning cycle more manageable for HPS.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz First Medicalcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz First Medicalcare will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"><span>ERO‚Äôs website</span>.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
