</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Toonga Fungani is a Tongan language immersion service in Glen Innes, Auckland. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including up to five children aged less than two years of age. Most of the children attending have Tongan heritage.</p><p>A separate indoor play space is provided for younger children to spend some of their day. They mix well with the older children at other times, supported by their teachers and older children.</p><p>The centre operates as a charitable trust under the Taka He Monu Methodist Church, which has strong connections with the local Tongan community. A board of trustees includes representatives from the church, parents, and staff. The number of qualified, registered teachers on the staff team has doubled since the last review.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended that managers and teachers improve:</p><ul>
<li>partnerships with families</li>
<li>resources to provide greater challenge for children</li>
<li>policies, procedures and systems</li>
<li>teacher appraisals and access to professional development</li>
<li>self review and strategic planning.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to these recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy and programme values Tongan language and culture. Children are provided with opportunities to be immersed in their own culture and to develop an appreciation and understanding other cultures. They confidently communicate in more than one language. Teachers are competent speakers of the Tongan language and include English, te reo MƒÅori and the Samoan language in the programme.</p><p>Children are secure and settled. They are confident and know centre routines well. Supportive, positive interactions among children and with teachers have fostered a strong sense of well-being and belonging. Infants and toddlers mix well with other children and are well supported to become more independent.</p><p>The centre programme is responsive to the interests of the children. Learning stories clearly show children‚Äôs dispositions and what they are learning. Children participate well at group times. Parents are supportive of, and involved in, the programme.</p><p>Music is a strong focus. Drums are popular with the children, inspiring song and movement. Background music contributes to the atmosphere in the centre and links well to Tongan culture.</p><p>Teachers have implemented an effective transition to school programme that focuses on developing literacy through oracy. They could now consider how they might provide more physical challenges for older children in the outdoor environment. More opportunities for children to share their creative thinking and learning would also help extend children‚Äôs language development.</p><p>A staff appraisal system has been implemented and now needs to be improved to meet Teachers‚Äô Council requirements. There are good support systems in place for provisionally registered teachers and professional learning. The involvement of one teacher in post graduate leadership studies should support the sustainability of the centre.</p><p>The manager and head teacher have worked with the board to develop a policy framework, strategic plan and personnel management systems. Self-review processes could be strengthened through the use of indicators of quality practice. Better links between staff appraisal, self review and strategic planning would improve cohesion across centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre leaders:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen the processes of teacher appraisal, strategic planning and self review</li>
<li>provide more resources to offer physical challenges for older children in the outdoor environment</li>
<li>promote more opportunities for children to share their creative thinking and learning to develop more complex language skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Toonga Fungani completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, the service should:</p><ul>
<li>appoint and provide appropriate training for a privacy officer</li>
<li>develop policies and procedures to ensure information about children and their privacy is protected.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Toonga Fungani will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
