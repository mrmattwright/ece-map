</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Early Explorers Childcare Centre was opened in 2012 to provide education and care for up to 50 children from three months to school age. It is open weekdays from 7am to 6pm. Children are cared for in two main areas. The younger children move to the older age group area when they are approximately two years of age.</p><p>The owner/manager of the centre has previous experience in early childhood education teaching and management. She employs a high percentage of qualified teachers, many of whom have worked together previously. They are a well established team. The ratio of teachers to children is higher than required by regulation.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on providing the time, space and freedom for children to develop as individuals who are confident to take risks, enjoy challenge and persevere while having fun.</p><p>Teachers understand the importance of working in partnership with parents/whānau, acknowledging and supporting cultural diversity. Children who attend the centre are from many different cultural back grounds.  </p><p>This is the first ERO review of Early Explorers Childcare Centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers work well together to support children’s learning and well being. They work alongside children to support their play. Teachers take time to observe and then ask questions and make suggestions to help children access resources and extend their learning.</p><p>Care practices for children under two are respectful. Teachers follow the preferred routines of individual children. They communicate regularly with parents about their child. Teachers talk with children to support their oral language development. They ensure that the environment invites children to explore and experiment.</p><p>The centre manager and her staff place a lot of importance on providing an environment for children that will support their learning. The centre is spacious and enables the children and staff to set out areas of play to suit the activities that develop from children’s interests. Play equipment and resources are varied, plentiful and of good quality. Children move freely between the indoors and outdoors.</p><p>Teachers keep good records of children’s interests and their learning. They use this information to identify ways that they can support children to learn. Recent professional development has led teachers to think more about their role and approach to extending children’s learning through play.</p><p>Teachers will continue to explore ways of encouraging parents to share information about children’s home life and use this information to assess and plan for children’s learning.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to learn in all areas of the curriculum. The development of early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge is well supported within the programme. There are also opportunities for children to learn about science and technology.</p><p>Teachers have made good progress including te reo Māori in the programme. They are considering how other aspects of Māori culture can also be introduced to children. They could include more discussion about the local area and places of significance from a Māori perspective.</p><p>The wide age range in the toddlers and preschool children’s area provides both advantages and challenges. Centre managers could regularly review how successfully the programme is catering for various groups of children.</p><p>Good management systems have been established. A clear vision and philosophy support the centre’s strategic direction. Self review is well understood and implemented and contributes to effective strategic planning. An up-to-date policy framework guides centre operations.</p><p>Performance management processes are well documented and lead to ongoing improvement. Appraisal systems are thorough and encourage staff to reflect on their practice. Professional development is meaningfully linked to appraisal and centre goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that centre staff should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>use performance management processes to clarify the teachers’ role in extending children’s learning</li>
<li>provide opportunities for children to develop their knowledge of Māori culture</li>
<li>develop teaching strategies to promote positive guidance for children</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Explorers Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Explorers Childcare Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Dale Bailey<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Northern Region</p><p>11 October 2013 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
