</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kid‚Äôs Cove Education &amp; Childcare, located in the multi-cultural community of Avondale, Auckland, offers all day education and care for children from three months to five years. A maximum of 33 children, including 8 up to the age of two years, are accommodated in two age-related rooms in a renovated house.</p><p>The service‚Äôs philosophy reflects the aims of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and emphasises a bi-cultural and multi-cultural approach to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The running of the centre is overseen by the owner. The centre manager supports two head teachers as well as the mainly qualified teaching staff. There has been good continuity of staff since the 2011 ERO review and report. They have responded positively to recommendations made in that report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming and supportive and, as a result, children are settle happily into the centre. Children are well cared for actively involved in centre activities. Many children have English as a second language and teachers support, encourage and extend children's use of English language during children's play. Teachers acknowledge children's bi-cultural and multi-ethnic identities and provide many opportunities for children to share their uniqueness and to take leadership roles. Children are respected and valued and their progress and achievements are celebrated daily.</p><p>Affectionate relationships between adults and babies and toddlers in the under two area are evident. The service‚Äôs routines are respectfully carried out and encourage children's independence. There is a wide range of ages in the under two area and teachers focus on developing children's physical and movement skills. Teachers could review how effectively they extend and challenge these younger children and consider the effectiveness of the resources and activities they provide.</p><p>Assessment records identify children's learning and dispositions. Teachers also record how they could extend and challenge children further. Teachers could use this good information to identify and group children who have similar learning interests. They could plan programmes to extend and challenge these groups and also record the progress children are making over their time at the centre.</p><p>On the day of the ERO review there were some examples of teachers promoting mathematics skills in the programme. A formal session is allocated daily to instruct children on literacy and mathematical skills. The formality of this instruction does not reflect the aims and principles of<em>Te Whariki</em>.</p><p>Parents have many opportunities to contribute to the programme design and centre policies. Parents report that they appreciate the good relationships and the support they receive from teachers.</p><p>The centre promotes success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori. Teachers maintain a focus on the bicultural heritage of New Zealand and offer a variety of ways for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to the programme. Teachers are committed to ensuring that the Te reo MƒÅori is integrated into the daily programme throughout the day.</p><p>The owner and centre manager provide effective management. Self review processes are focused on making positive improvement to the centre. Teachers‚Äô ongoing development is well supported. More specific feedback from the centre manager could provide teachers with useful information about relevant performance goals. The centre‚Äôs ongoing improvement could be strengthened through the centre manager seeking appraisal input from an external early childhood educator.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the owner and centre manager agree that key next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>the use of assessment records to plan, extend and further challenge individuals and groups of children</li>
<li>assessing progress and documenting aspects of children‚Äôs learning over time</li>
<li>reviewing the effectiveness of the mathematics programme in terms of outcomes for children</li>
<li>reviewing and aligning the transition to school programme with the principles and aims of<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kid's Cove Education &amp; Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kid's Cove Education &amp; Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
