</table><p>While there are many positive strengths evident at Tots Love Country, the service needs support to further improve self review, strategic planning, the appraisal process, assessment, planning and evaluation of learning, teachers' knowledge, and understanding of biculturalism.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tots Love Country Education and Care centre is a privately owned centre located in attractive rural surrounds near to the Hamilton Zoo. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children including up to 10 under two years. The centre operates in a mixed-age setting between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm. At the time of this ERO review there were 36 children on the roll including 8 aged under two years.</p><p>The centre gives priority to providing a programme that responds to the family, community, and caring for the environment and living things. At certain times of the day children are grouped according to their ages for teacher-led activities.</p><p>The centre continues to operate under the governance and management of the owners and centre manager. Since the ERO report in July 2011 there have been changes to the teaching staff and two teachers in-training have joined the teaching team. The centre maintains its commitment to exceed the ratio of trained teachers to children. Some positive improvements to the indoor and outdoor environment have benefitted teachers and children.</p><p>The centre needs to continue making progress and improvements to the areas for development and review identified in the 2011 ERO report relating to:</p><ul>
<li>self review</li>
<li>strengthening bicultural practices in the programme and environment</li>
<li>assessment and evaluation, particularly for individual children.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there is a need to review and update centre policies and strengthen strategic planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, confident learners and demonstrate high levels of enjoyment as they interact with caring adults and their friends. They experience a programme which is a good balance of age-appropriate teacher-led learning as well as opportunities for learning through free play. Familiar routines and transitions promote children‚Äôs sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers have created a welcoming atmosphere where parents and whƒÅnau feel free to participate and contribute. There are regular opportunities for families to gather, celebrate and enjoy each others‚Äô company. Families are well informed through a range of effective communication strategies that include attractive centre displays, children‚Äôs individual portfolios and social media.</p><p>Children under the age of two receive responsive and nurturing care. The environment provided for them promotes their development as confident explorers and includes high-quality equipment, resources and care facilities. ERO noted that infants were relaxed, settled and benefitting from observing and engaging with older siblings and other children.</p><p>Teachers consistently integrate early concepts of literacy and mathematics into meaningful and authentic contexts and conversations with children throughout the day.</p><p>The spacious natural environment contributes strongly to children‚Äôs learning and enriches their opportunities to explore, experience challenge and develop their physical competencies. A feature of the programme is the special emphasis teachers place on including children in caring for a variety of farm animals and birds. Children are developing skills and knowledge about sustainability and the natural world.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives are becoming increasingly evident through the use of tikanga MƒÅori protocols such as karakia before meals, waiata and some te reo MƒÅori in appropriate contexts for young children. Teachers acknowledge they are in the early stages of developing their understanding of bicultural perspectives.</p><p>ERO observed teachers:</p><ul>
<li>engaging in warm, responsive and respectful relationships amongst children and families</li>
<li>showing interest and entering into children‚Äôs play at an appropriate level</li>
<li>enriching learning through singing, games and activities</li>
<li>extending children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>providing children with opportunities to develop their social skills and ability to solve problems peacefully.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager has continued to maintain a positive team culture through a time of staff changes. She is committed to the philosophy and vision of the centre. She models effective teaching strategies and provides professional support and mentoring for the teachers in training. A useful framework for self review is leading to ongoing improvement of the environment and some aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>Dedicated centre owners continue to work in a positive partnership with the centre manager in the best interests of children and families. The centre‚Äôs philosophy and vision are clearly articulated and evident in the programme. Relevant and regular professional development opportunities are provided for teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the service needs support to keep up-to-date with current theory and practice and to continually develop the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>centre policies</li>
<li>systems and processes for self review and strategic planning</li>
<li>the appraisal processes</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation of learning</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô knowledge and understanding of biculturalism.</li>
</ul><p>The appraisal process should align with the current Registered Teachers‚Äô Criteria and include high-quality indicators agreed on by teachers. The centre manager‚Äôs appraisal should include opportunities to receive rigorous and regular feedback from suitably qualified professionals.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation would be improved by teachers collaboratively developing and documenting clear guidelines and expectations. Assessment should include the individual language, culture and identity of each child, and show their progress and development over time.</p><p>Centre leaders need to ensure that teachers have adequate time to meet together for effective team building and centre planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tots Love Country completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to self review, strategic planning, provision of activities and teacher knowledge of biculturalism. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><p>Self review and strategic planning require strengthening to address all areas of centre operations and ensure these align with regulatory requirements and best practice in early childhood education.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA8]</em></p><p>Children need ready access to essential areas of play at all times.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF4]</em></p><p>Teachers need to continue to build their knowledge and understanding of bicultural practices. This should enable the service to further promote success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori and build all children‚Äôs knowledge of New Zealand as a bicultural society.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C5, C6]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Tots Love Country will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
