</table><p>Kowhai Corner Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kowhai Corner Learning Centre provides education and care for up to 20 children under 2 years of age. All of the children enrolled are MƒÅori. This is the first ERO report for this centre, which opened in May 2018.</p><p>The centre was established as part of a Ministry of Education initiative to provide targeted secondary education for young parents in the local area. It caters for the children of parents attending the nearby Teen Parent Unit (TPU), as well as offering a limited number of places for infants and toddlers from the wider community. The partnership between the centre and the TPU continues to be developed.</p><p>The centre operates in conjunction with an established, adjoining centre that is licensed for children up to school age. The service provider maintains operating systems and processes across the two centres. There is a shared leadership structure.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly, and are supported where needed, by caring interactions with kaiako. Toddlers confidently explore the well-resourced learning spaces. Children play well alongside each other in a peaceful, unhurried environment.</p><p>Kaiako engage in rituals of care that are respectful and promote each child's emotional and physical wellbeing. They foster children's independence and developing self-help skills. Kaiako are responsive to children's non-verbal cues and know these young children very well.</p><p>Kaiako skilfully integrate te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori and spontaneous waiata and music into the programme. They provide an appropriate range of outdoor play equipment to support children to challenge and develop their physical skills. Infants and toddlers enjoy seeing and hearing what is happening in the adjacent playground for older children. They benefit from these social interactions with siblings and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Centre leaders make good use of professional learning opportunities to increase their understanding of best practice. Their learning about brain development is having a significant impact on curriculum provision and the positive ways that kaiako interact with children. New processes for assessment and planning, internal evaluation, and teacher appraisal have been introduced. It is now time for leaders to prioritise and plan how kaiako will embed these new processes to promote consistent teaching practices.</p><p>The owners have a clear focus on improving and building staff capability. The establishment of this centre, and its careful integration with the adjoining Kowhai Corner service, has helped to establish sound foundations for future development. The service provider has identified that reviewing the centre's philosophy, policies and procedures is a priority.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include consolidating and embedding:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning processes, to ensure teachers consistently document thorough records of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal processes, including ensuring that there is evidence of regular mentor/appraiser feedback against identified goals and next steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher inquiry and internal evaluation processes, including strengthening documentation to show the impact on teachers' practices and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kowhai Corner Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for Compliance</h3><p>The service provider must ensure that all adults working with children have been police vetted.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7,7A; Children's Act 2014.</em></p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
