</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Sparks Educare, in Pukekohe, provides all day education and care services to babies, toddlers and children up to five years of age. The centre is licensed for 38 children including 12 children up to the age of two years. The centre is a privately owned and operated teacher led centre. The supervisor leads and manages the curriculum and day-to-day operations.</p><p>Little Sparks Educare provides a separate building for the care and education of infants and toddlers. Older children have their own indoor and outdoor area. There are five qualified teachers and one in training. The families that attend are diverse in terms of socio-economic backgrounds, ethnicity, culture and spiritual beliefs. There are 4 MƒÅori and 7 Pacific children attending the centre.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to the 2013 ERO review. The family orientated centre philosophy, strategic plan and appraisal system have all been collaboratively developed with the teaching staff. Targeted professional development has focussed on improving teaching and learning practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. They are confident and relaxed with staff and willingly engage in conversations with them. Children are encouraged to be independent and take a lead role in their play. They settle quickly into activities, manage routines and enjoy the company of peers. Their emotional wellbeing and enthusiasm for learning is nurtured.</p><p>Responsive and caring relationships underpin the centre‚Äôs welcoming atmosphere. Teachers know about their children and their backgrounds. Interactions with children are affirming, supportive and respectful. Teachers use good questioning techniques to sustain conversations with children and to promote problem solving. Children‚Äôs individual assessment portfolios show their progress, interests, and learning pathways.</p><p>Children enjoy an interesting and varied programme. There are good periods of uninterrupted time where they are able to explore and develop their interests. Infants benefit from individualised nurturing care. Children engage in sustained imaginative play, experiment with art processes and enjoy music and dance. Routines are flexible, relaxed and well managed.</p><p>Teachers ensure the centre is interesting and inviting with well defined learning spaces. Children move freely between indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor area is thoughtfully set up to provide children with additional activities and good opportunities for physical challenge and active play. Children‚Äôs artwork is presented attractively on the walls. This reflects the value that teachers place on children‚Äôs creativity and emerging literacy. Teachers adapt the environment to cater to children‚Äôs preferences and interests. The environment stimulates and sustains children‚Äôs play and learning.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are important contributors to the life of the centre. Teachers value the diversity of ethnicities and backgrounds of children‚Äôs families. They acknowledge and respect tikanga MƒÅori and are open to the opportunities offered to them to improve their te reo MƒÅori. Teachers are increasing connections with the local MƒÅori community. Recent links with Te Huarahi, a local community initiative, should strengthen connections with schools and early childhood centres in Te Puaha o Waikato area.</p><p>The centre supervisor provides curriculum leadership within a cooperative and collegial teaching team. The proactive response to professional learning is resulting in improved teaching practice and growing staff confidence as a team of educators. Teachers are ready to share their new knowledge and grow their abilities as leaders in the centre.</p><p>The centre owner has sought external professional development and networking to further build her leadership capacity and connect to the wider community. She provides support and structure for the teaching team so teachers can focus on children and their care and learning. Frameworks are in place to ensure there is regular self review of policies and procedures. Systems are developing to ensure that self review is captured in a collaborative and considered way.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to further improve practice centre leaders identify the need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>improve centre documentation of planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen culturally responsive teacher practice</li>
<li>build and document shared professional knowledge and understandings to further strengthen teaching and leadership practice</li>
<li>develop and document teachers‚Äô reflective practice and approaches</li>
<li>strengthen and document self-review processes across the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Sparks Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Sparks Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
