</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Open Spaces Preschool Limited is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 30 children, including up to eight aged under two years. It is owned and administered by a board of directors. The centre manager leads a team of four other qualified teachers, one teacher in training and one unqualified teacher.</p><p>The philosophy of the service identifies respectful and trusting relationships as the foundation for all learning. Teaching practices are linked to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Open Spaces prides itself on being a nature rich community where daily interactions with the natural environment form the basis of the curriculum.</p><p>The service is located in a rural area and regular walking excursions into the countryside, across adjoining farmland, are a significant feature of the programme. A separate indoor play space is provided for infants and toddlers. They are supported to freely explore the extensive outdoor gardens and play areas alongside older children.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report highlighted children's enjoyment of the 'wild woods' programme and effective communications with parents that shared children's learning. The report also identified numerous areas that required strengthening, including personnel management, self-review, programme planning, hazard identification and supervision plans. Staff have responded very positively to ERO's recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of the service is evident in practice. Children are confident and curious explorers and investigators who competently lead their own learning. They are very comfortable in the centre setting, and in the local countryside.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from sensitive caregiving, interactions with older children and opportunities to explore the natural world with all their senses. Their programme has a calm, gentle pace.</p><p>Inviting, challenging spaces have evolved over time in the outdoor environment, through children's interests and the use and re-use of materials in ways that inspire their imagination. Older children thoughtfully manipulate resources and set physical challenges for themselves in these spaces. Teachers have strategically placed small blackboards in the garden that invite children's creativity and their engagement in meaningful literacy learning experiences.</p><p>Children are offered authentic leadership opportunities that embed their sense of responsibility and respect for others and the environment. These opportunities arise through sensitive, responsive teaching strategies within the centre and during walks to the 'wild woods'.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO expressed appreciation of the teachers' attention to the needs of each individual child. They enjoy the opportunities provided for children to engage with the natural world, and the positive outcomes for their children in increased wellbeing, confidence and physical fitness levels.</p><p>There are authentic connections with tikanga and kaupapa Māori in the learning environment and in teaching practices. Te reo Māori, waiata and karakia are woven throughout the programme. A commitment to valuing the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand frames the service's values and operations.</p><p>Teachers genuinely listen to children and explore the deeper meanings of their conversations. They build positive relationships with children and respond to their preferences, strengths and learning dispositions. There is a strong sense of community, where adults and children are both teachers and learners.</p><p>Planning is targeted at different age groups, and is related to the interests of individual children and their parents' aspirations. Stories about children's learning show connectivity and teachers' analysis of significant learning. There is a clear focus throughout the programme on meaningful literacy, numeracy, science and technology learning.</p><p>A restructure of centre governance has made a positive impact on the management of the service. A framework of policies and procedures guides practice and a regular review cycle has been established. The manager provides high quality leadership for the cohesive team, which shares the same philosophy and teaching approach. The team's ongoing research into new developments that produce positive outcomes in early childhood education, strongly guides practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to continue to provide good quality outcomes for children, centre leaders will:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and refine their documentation of children's learning and include how teachers respond to children's interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review policies and procedures to ensure continued alignment with current legal requirements. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Open Spaces Preschool Academy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Open Spaces Preschool Academy will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>15 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
