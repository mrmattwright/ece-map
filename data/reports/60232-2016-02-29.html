</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stepping Stones Community Centre is licensed for 42 children, including 14 up to two years of age. Nine children identify as MƒÅori. The centre has been providing for families and children in the Upper Hutt community for over thirty years. It has two separate buildings and playgrounds, with a nursery for children aged up to two and a preschool for those over two years of age.</p><p>The centre is governed by a trust committee largely made up of parents. The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day management and two supervisors have oversight for the nursery and preschool. Almost all the teachers are trained and registered teachers and there has been a low staff turnover.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. The May 2013 ERO report identified the need to strengthen learning partnerships with families and extend children‚Äôs learning through the programme.</p><p>Since that time, teachers in the nursery have continued to develop the primary caregiver/key teacher approach. Teachers in the preschool have refined key teaching responsibilities, developed a four-year-old programme and introduced online learning stories for families. The centre has also achieved the gold star healthy heart award.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a high quality, well-considered curriculum. It is based on their emerging interests and needs, and provides appropriate challenge. Early literacy and mathematics skills are developed, together with investigation, problem solving and social competencies. Children are happy and settled with a strong sense of belonging apparent.</p><p>Child-initiated play is clearly evident. Children happily explore the thoughtfully developed indoor and outside environments. Their independence is fostered and well supported. The outdoor environment provides appropriate physical challenges, as well as opportunities for creative and imaginative play. Children confidently seek help from teachers as they explore.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. They gather information from parents and whƒÅnau on enrolment, through surveys and discussions. As a result, teachers are aware of children‚Äôs diverse needs and interests and are skilled at noticing, recognising and responding through programme planning. The key teacher approach supports this development.</p><p>Interactions between children and teachers are positive, sensitive and responsive. Children up to two years are well cared for and learn in a calm, settled environment. The pace is unhurried and relationships are warm and respectful. Teachers follow each child‚Äôs routines. This fosters children‚Äôs wellbeing and sense of security.</p><p>Strong consideration is given to the centre‚Äôs bicultural programme. Regular use of te reo MƒÅori is integrated naturally throughout the day. Older children are developing confidence to use simple words and phrases and share their mihi with their peers.</p><p>MƒÅori whƒÅnau share the aspirations they have for their children to be successful as MƒÅori. This information is used to inform planning, with evidence of progress shared through each child‚Äôs learning stories.</p><p>Families are well informed about their child‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. Planning and photographic evidence is displayed. Learning stories and photographs are shared with families through their child‚Äôs profile books and are sent to parents online. Family members are encouraged to provide feedback. This helps promote partnership for each child‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Transitions into the centre, between the nursery and preschool, and on to school are effective. There is regular communication between families and key teachers, and between teachers when children transition into the preschool. Greater emphasis is given to preparing older children for school through an interesting range of activities to extend thinking.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed with an emphasis on continuous improvement. Strategic and annual plans are comprehensive. The centre manager and supervisors provide strong, knowledgeable leadership. They work collaboratively with the teaching team to further enhance outcomes for children.</p><p>Many aspects of effective internal evaluation are evident. Spontaneous and planned reviews are undertaken and well documented. Through this process, teachers regularly reflect on practices to promote improvement. They are supported by an appraisal process that identifies strengths and provides opportunities for targeted professional learning and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To support continuous improvement the next steps for development are to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>planned reviews evaluate the impact of developments. Including a schedule for planned reviews in the annual plan is likely to support closer alignment between ongoing development and an evaluation of its effectiveness</li>
<li>self review and appraisal policies and procedures are updated in partnership with trust members, managers and teachers. This should help promote shared understanding about effective internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stepping Stones Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stepping Stones Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>29 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
