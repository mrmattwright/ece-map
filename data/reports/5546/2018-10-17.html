</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Holborn Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 40 children, aged over two years. Sessions run daily from 8:30am to 2:30pm. At the time of this ERO evaluation, nine of the 35 children enrolled identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasise parents, whƒÅnau, caregivers and kaiako working¬† together to build a supportive, stable environment that enables tamariki to develop a sense of belonging.</p><p>Since the September 2015 report, the teaching team has experienced significant changes.</p><p>Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of a relieving head teacher. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>Holborn Kindergarten is one of 19 services in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the previous ERO review, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key next steps for this kindergarten. These included: developing good practice indicators based on the teaching philosophy; strengthening learning partnerships with whƒÅnau; and internal evaluation practice. Good progress is evident.</p><p>Practices requiring development were also identified for the association. These included: strategic planning; cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families; evaluation; and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of nine kindergartens in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based programme. A home-like environment promotes exploration, interactions, experimentation and fun. Positive and warm relationships between children and with teachers are highly evident. Older children work confidently and collaboratively with younger peers.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers work collaboratively with families, whƒÅnau and outside agencies to support their full participation in the programme.</p><p>Te Ao MƒÅori is valued in the kindergarten. Children have opportunities to share and celebrate their pepeha as well as use poi and rakau to enrich their learning. Teachers use aspects of kaupapa MƒÅori in the curriculum. Leaders and teachers should consider how to weave a place-based curriculum that promotes and celebrates local places of significant to MƒÅori. In addition, teachers should explore how best to engage with whƒÅnau MƒÅori to deepen their understanding of what educational success looks like. Consultation should also occur with the Pacific community.</p><p>A new system for planning children‚Äôs learning, based on their emerging interests is currently being implemented. Teachers are working with parents and whƒÅnau to develop more meaningful learning goals for all children. Assessment builds children's identity as a successful learner. The kindergarten's philosophy and <em>Te Wh</em>ƒÅ<em>riki</em> the early childhood curriculum are used to guide this process. Leaders have identified that teachers should enhance their approach by:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the visibility of children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities in their assessment documentation</li>
<li>regularly measuring its impact on outcomes for individual children.</li>
</ul><p>A well-considered internal evaluation framework is in place to support decision making. Leaders and teachers are very reflective and improvement focused. Teachers use evaluation to determine how well the curriculum and their practices impact on children‚Äôs learning. Enhancing the focus on outcomes for children, when developing good practice indicators, is a next step.</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goal-setting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen teacher development by implementing an inquiry-based approach to appraisal. This should support teachers to better measure the success of improved practices in promoting outcomes for specific children and priority groups.</p><p>The governance board includes community representatives with a wide range of useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work well together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. Equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing are actively sought.</p><p>The association's senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning. Leaders are successfully fostering a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a place-based curriculum</li>
<li>promote educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children</li>
<li>enhance aspects of the assessment framework</li>
<li>continue to enhance aspects of internal evaluation practice.</li>
</ul><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that they should continue to build their effectiveness by:</p><ul>
<li>measuring the extent to which children's and their families‚Äô outcomes are improved though association initiatives and systems. This should include analysing their impact on specific priority groups</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for whƒÅnau to actively contribute to the association‚Äôs operation and strategic direction.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Holborn Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Holborn Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</p><p>17 October 2018¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
