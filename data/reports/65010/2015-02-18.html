</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Addington Q1 is a network operating under national early childhood education provider PORSE In-Home Childcare. With a strong focus on education and training, PORSE supports individuals, families and communities by using the latest scientific research in early brain development and attachment theory to inform programme delivery and address education needs. The vision, 'expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare inhome' is anchored with a mission statement, 'to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.'</p><p>There are two models that PORSE offers as part of in-home childcare delivery - the Home Educator model, where an educator works from their own home, and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works from the family's home. Of the 96 children enrolled in the network at the time of this review, six identify as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators to provide ongoing support with learning programmes to enhance learning and development opportunities for children. PORSE also supports families and educators with contract set-up, administration and payroll services. Community coaches support programme tutors, reporting to national coaches.</p><p>PORSE provided a range of support to educators, families and staff following the Canterbury earthquakes in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five home-based networks in the PORSE umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging are promoted within the small group size that enables them to develop close, caring relationship with their educator. Qualified and registered programme tutors regularly visit and support educators to plan and implement a curriculum that provides a range of learning experiences and activities for children.</p><p>Children's portfolios indicate that they are involved in a wide range of interesting curriculum activities that are linked to literacy, music, art, dramatic play and physical activity. Mathematical learning occurs mainly incidentally within daily, real life, experiences around the home and in the community.</p><p>Although there is some variation in assessment practices, there is evidence of good quality assessment that recognises children&rsquo;s learning. These examples also provide practical next steps to extend children&rsquo;s learning interests. Programme tutors use a range of ways to help all educators to work towards better quality assessment.</p><p>The service leaders and programme tutors place a strong emphasis on providing appropriate support for children up to two years old. Educators are guided to follow home routines and focus on caring and nurturing interactions within a home setting. Specific matching of educators with children and families helps to ensure each child&rsquo;s specific interests and needs are well considered.</p><p>Children and families, with English as a second language, and those who have special education needs are provided with specific support from programme tutors and educators. They also work closely with specialist agencies where appropriate.</p><p>Programme tutors and educators are developing an increasing focus on providing children with opportunities to become more aware of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Educators can access a range of resources, and programme tutors have undertaken professional development. Programme tutors should use this new knowledge to inform all aspects of service operation, including the curriculum and success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori. This continues to be an area for development.</p><p>There are some robust appraisal and performance management systems in place. Educators are annually appraised by programme tutors who set and monitor goals. Parents' views are part of this process. The programme tutors appraisal is of good quality but requires further development to ensure that they are appraised against all the Registered Teacher Criteria annually.</p><p>Self review is an area for development. The service&rsquo;s self review includes both planned and spontaneous reviews. Using a more evaluative approach to review, that focuses on the quality or effectiveness of practice and the impact on outcomes for children, should strengthen current practice. The community coach and programme tutors are currently undergoing further training to strengthen their understanding of self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and ERO agree that in order to continue to provide for the needs of all children, the programme tutors should strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum planning and review to increase specific learning opportunities, for example in mathematics</li>
<li>the service&rsquo;s bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>self-review processes to sustain high quality practices that benefit learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Addington Q1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The national and community coaches have recently placed a strong focus on developing and implementing effective health and safety procedures for each home-care and playschool setting.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of PORSE Addington Q1 will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie,</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region,</p><p>18 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
