</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>There are two Zigzagzoo early childhood centres in Queenstown. The Academic College Group (ACG) based in Auckland is the licensee of Zigzagzoo early childhood services, having taken ownership of this service in 2014. An operations manager has overall responsibility for both centres. A team leader supports the learning and teaching within each of the three rooms. The three Queenstown team leaders are new appointments.</p><p>This centre is located at Remarkables Park and is a full-day service licensed for 80 children, including 25 under two years of age. The service aims to provide education and care based on philosophies that include RIE (Resources for Infant Educarers) and Reggio Emilia approaches.</p><p>Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre Remarkables Park has a high turnover of staff. There has been little progress with the implementation of practices to address the recommendations of the 2015 ERO review. There are few systems to adequately support the centre operations and ensure positive outcomes for children can be sustained.</p><p>The April 2015 ERO report recommended the owners, managers, leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>identify key priorities for the centre's future development</li>
<li>develop actions to achieve the centre's priorities over time</li>
<li>clarify expectations of teachers' work, roles, and lines of reporting and responsibility</li>
<li>align self review, appraisals, team meetings and professional development to achieve the centre's key priorities.</li>
</ul><p>Two further key priorities from the ERO report were for leaders to ensure that planning for children focused on future learning and to develop bicultural practices, including the integration of MƒÅori perspectives in the programme.</p><p>There has been very little significant progress with implementing the recommendations from the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the centre engage well with a range of resources and activities that support and encourage their learning. The environment is spacious and offers many opportunities for children to develop their physical and social skills. Children work and play well together, in small groups or alongside others. Friendships between children are apparent. They enjoy opportunities to be creative and engage in imaginative play together. Children know the teachers' expectations for behaviour. The centre routines are becoming well established. Children are confident and enjoy showing they can take responsibility for their actions and be independent. Teachers work alongside children and engage in purposeful conversations that are affirming and help extend children's thinking.</p><p>The operations manager has good relationships with children and their families. She is supportive of staff who are encouraged to develop leadership skills and participate in professional development.</p><p>The next steps for governance and management remain those from the 2015 ERO report.</p><p>The owners and the centres' operation manager need to ensure there are robust systems to accurately report and monitor compliance with regulatory requirements across all aspects of the operation. This needs to include robust internal evaluation to inform decision making at governance level. This will help determine key strategic and annual priorities for long and short-term centre development.</p><p>The ACG licensee needs to provide the centre operations manager with ongoing support and guidance to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify and differentiate between the centre‚Äôs vision, philosophy and key learning priorities</li>
<li>develop strategic and annual plans to align with these and ensure that progress towards identified goals is systematically monitored and reported</li>
<li>develop centre-wide guidelines/expectations for teaching and learning</li>
<li>monitor and evaluate the quality of centre practices to ensure compliance with requirements</li>
<li>develop and implement an effective appraisal system</li>
<li>further develop leaders' understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><p>The operations manager needs to clearly identify and communicate centre-wide expectations for teaching and learning. The team leaders in each room have been working independently to establish practices within their teams and develop ways to support children‚Äôs learning and development. The team leaders each have individual strengths and abilities but have not yet established how they will work as a team of leaders to ensure consistent practice across the service. Teaching practices need to align to an agreed centre-wide philosophy that has clear key learning priorities.</p><p>The team leader in the infant room is making progress building the confidence of her new team of teachers to work collaboratively in response to the needs of children. Team leaders and teachers are affirming of children‚Äôs learning and achievements and work alongside children supporting and encouraging them to be independent and develop social skills. Children have access to a range of resources and experiences in the programme that support their interests and provide opportunity for learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for team leaders:</p><p>Team leaders need to collaborate to establish effective systems that:</p><ul>
<li>align practices with the centre-wide philosophy and agreed curriculum priorities</li>
<li>ensure ongoing effective group and individual assessment, planning and evaluation of programmes for children's learning</li>
<li>help the development of bicultural practice and the further integration of MƒÅori perspectives in programmes</li>
<li>regularly evaluate teaching practices to ensure positive outcomes for children, particularly priority learners</li>
<li>ensure the ongoing implementation of effective appraisal processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre Remarkables Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified compliance areas where practices were not satisfactory or requirements were not met. The centre owners (ACG) completed an internal Health and Safety Performance Assessment in 2017 which also highlighted areas of non-compliance identified as a risk.</p><p>The overarching concern is the lack of adequate systems and insufficient clarity around processes to identify, maintain and improve compliance with requirements.</p><p>To ensure compliance with Regulation 47, the owners need to ensure the service is effectively governed, and is managed in accordance with good management practices. ACG and the centre manager need to ensure there are robust policies and procedures that:</p><ul>
<li>align with child protection requirements and the Vulnerable Children's Act 2014 (such as in the appointment process, GMA7A)</li>
<li>include accidents analysis and reporting (HS12)</li>
<li>are updated and comply with administration of medications requirements (HS28)</li>
<li>support robust management of risks on excursions (HS17)</li>
<li>support teacher registration and appraisals (GMA7)</li>
<li>address the risks identified in the ACG internal health and safety assessment</li>
<li>ensure a regular and consistent quality of assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning (Regulation 43, C5 and C6)</li>
<li>ensure useful strategic and annual plans are developed to guide the development of the services operation (GMA8).</li>
</ul><p>There needs to be a robust system and process to regularly review all aspects of the centre operation to ensure practices meet legal requirements and to build on the quality of centre practices (GMA6).</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a comprehensive plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre Remarkables Park will be within two years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
