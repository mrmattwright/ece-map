</table><p>Healthkids Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Healthkids Preschool is a community-based, not-for-profit early childhood education service. It is located in the Nelson Hospital complex in a homely villa with spacious natural grounds. The preschool provides care and education for children from birth-to-school age. It serves a diverse range of cultures, including families of staff at the hospital and from the local community.</p><p>A board of trustees governs the overall operation of the centre. A senior teacher is responsible for the day-to-day management, including the curriculum. Most staff are experienced and registered early childhood teachers. The centre also supports some teachers who are in training.</p><p>Since the previous 2015 ERO review, there have been significant changes in staffing, including leadership and the teaching team. External professional support, contracted through the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association, has supported good progress with the areas identified by ERO for improvement. This includes developing assessment and internal evaluation systems, transition to school practices and aligning key management processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers warmly welcome children and families and foster positive, inclusive relationships. Children benefit from caring and nurturing interactions with teachers. They are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves, to care for others and to develop friendships.</p><p>The culture, language and identity of children and families is respected, acknowledged and celebrated, including the use of sign language. All children are seen as capable and competent learners. Teachers respectfully support children with additional needs to succeed in their learning.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is given prominence in practices and key documentation. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated in ways that are meaningful for children and respectful of the MƒÅori culture. Specialised internal expertise is increasing teachers' understanding and confidence with te ao MƒÅori. Teachers promote MƒÅori children's success as MƒÅori and a bicultural curriculum to benefit all children.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to make choices and to follow their interests within a child-centred curriculum. They are provided with a good range of creative, sensory and physical play to support their learning and engagement in the programme. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into the programme. Purposeful links to the local community, including planned excursions beyond the centre, enrich the curriculum offered to children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from consistent and respectful caregiving that supports their sense of security and wellbeing. Teachers and parents work together to provide predictable routines for children‚Äôs changing needs. Children enjoy freedom of movement to explore and make discoveries.</p><p>Children are at the heart of all decision making. Leaders and teachers sensitively advocate for infants, toddlers, young children and their whƒÅnau. Teachers are responsive to the individual interests, strengths and capability of children.</p><p>Personalised transitions into the centre, between rooms and onto school help children to settle well and to develop a sense of belonging. Teachers promote partnerships in learning with parents and whƒÅnau through a range of responsive communication and consultation methods.</p><p>Parents are well informed about children‚Äôs interests and learning through well written learning records, wall displays, use of digital technologies and informal conversations.</p><p>Leadership is strongly focused on building positive relationships and promotes collaboration and professional practice based on respect and trust. Leaders actively promote the shared vision, philosophy and goals of the service. They value and make good use of the strengths of staff to build the collective capability of teachers and leadership capacity.</p><p>The board of trustees brings a range of expertise and experience to help support the effective operation of the service. It places emphasis on aligning the strategic and annual plans with internal evaluation and professional development. Leaders provide the board with regular progress reports. Trustees have a strong focus on ensuring continual improvement and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders have identified, and ERO agrees that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen all teachers' confidence in the use of in-depth internal evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement the new appraisal process, including teaching as inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a well understood planning and evaluation process for children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understandings regarding the implementation of Te WhƒÅriki 2017.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Healthkids Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Healthkids Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
