</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Otumoetai Kindergarten is located in Tauranga, providing school-day and sessional education for children from two years to school age. The Kindergarten is licensed for 45 and has a current roll of 54 children including five who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>There are four qualified and registered teachers, along with a part-time teacher aide and administrator. The head teacher is responsible for the oversight of governance and providing professional leadership and support for the staff.</p><p>The kindergarten is a not-for-profit early childhood education service and is one of 20 kindergartens that operate under the umbrella organisation of Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association (TRK, also known as Inspired Kindergartens). Senior teachers oversee and support the professional development work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a resource teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for staff about te ao MƒÅori. The organisation sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens upholding their vision of ‚ÄòMaking the early years count‚Äô.</p><p>Otumoetai Kindergarten's philosophy acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi, <em>Te Whariki</em>, Early childhood curriculum and the organisational values as the core of how they engage in teaching and learning together. They aim to work in partnership with parents, whƒÅnau and the community in order to support the individual needs of children in a nurturing and empowering manner.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded well to ERO‚ÄôS previous review findings and areas for development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Inspired Kindergarten Organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Reciprocal relationships between teachers, children and their whƒÅnau are built on respect and trust. Relationships are well established and provide sound foundations for children‚Äôs learning. Teachers are reflective practitioners who evaluate their teaching practices and the impact of these on outcomes for children. They understand whƒÅnau aspirations for their children and work in partnership to achieve them. Teachers use a range of positive guidance and intentional teaching strategies to promote social problem solving and encourage emotional regulation.</p><p>Children enjoy learning and playing in an environment of natural materials and high-quality resources. Daily routines provide children with rich opportunities for social interactions. A range of initiatives is used to respond to the language, culture and identities of all children. Teachers have shown growth in their confidence to integrate waiata, karakia, te reo MƒÅori and MƒÅori legends into the daily programmes.</p><p>The rich curriculum affords children a vast range of learning opportunities that emerge from their individual interests. Teachers value and seek the contribution of children, parents and whƒÅnau in order to effectively plan and implement authentic learning experiences. Assessment is focused on dispositions for learning and provides further opportunity for parents and whƒÅnau to engage with their child's learning. Mathematics, literacy, science and the creative arts are well integrated into children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Leaders, teachers and support staff, work in partnership with relevant agencies and parents of children with special needs to improve and enhance their learning. Te ao MƒÅori is naturally integrated into the daily programme. These bicultural and multicultural learning experiences now need to be reflected in children's learning stories along with possible next steps for individuals learning.</p><p>Leaders work collaboratively with a focus on positive outcomes for children. The head teacher has created an effective team culture based on relational trust and collaborative practice. She is currently leading the development of a new centre philosophy that reflects whƒÅnau, teacher and children‚Äôs aspirations, and <em>Te Whariki</em>, Early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Well-developed self-review processes contribute to kindergarten improvement and positive outcomes for children. A recently reviewed teacher appraisal process aligns with the Education Council requirements and the focus on teacher as inquiry contributes to improved teacher practice. Professional development for teachers is aligned to the strategic plan and responds to teachers' individual needs. A well-developed strategic plan identifies the centre priorities towards achieving its vision. The head teacher and staff respectfully validate te ao MƒÅori by recently making a considered effort to building partnerships with local iwi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers need to further develop their process and practices by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>including possible next steps for children's learning or additional support if needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledging and celebrating childrens' language, culture and identity in their learning achievements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Otumoetai Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Otumoetai Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>19 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
