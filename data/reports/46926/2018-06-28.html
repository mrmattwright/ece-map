</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mountainside Educare is a privately-owned education and care service. It has been open for two years and this is its first ERO report. The purpose-built centre is well designed to take advantage of natural light and indoor-outdoor flow.</p><p>Mountainside is licensed for 40 children up to school age, including up to 10 children under two years of age. Children learn and play in a mixed-age environment, with provision for older children to work in a side room. A centre manager provides overall centre leadership, and also has teaching responsibilities. All teachers are qualified.</p><p>The philosophy is based on the principles of relationships, respect and communication. Teachers endeavour to provide a high-quality education and care centre that is a home-away-from-home experience.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging to their centre. Records of learning show that children make good progress against their individual learning priorities and the centre's priorities. Planning for individual children:</p><ul>
<li>is responsive to children's current needs and development stages</li>
<li>is firmly based on the centre's learning priorities</li>
<li>guides authentic learning that is based on parents' aspirations, and what teachers have noticed about children's interests and development.</li>
</ul><p>Children's progress is well tracked, shared with parents and whƒÅnau, and used to inform children's next learning directions. Teachers regularly evaluate the overall progress children are making over time.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a growing commitment to providing an environment that includes MƒÅori language and culture. The mixed-age group effectively supports the values of tuakana-teina/older supporting younger, manaakitanga/caring and whanaungatanga/relationships.</p><p>Teachers have caring and respectful relationships with the children and their whƒÅnau. They are nurturing and responsive to infants' needs and actions. The well-thought-out physical environment provides strongly for children's emotional and physical wellbeing, and their intellectual stimulation. The centre is strategic in its staffing to ensure good attachments and relationships. Children under two have strong secure attachments with their teachers.</p><p>Leaders use effective systems to build collective capacity amongst staff and sustainability within the centre. The useful long-term planning is carefully aligned to the centre's vision and philosophy. The strategic plan is thoughtfully set out to ensure good use and understanding of what is to be done, why, and by when.</p><p>Teachers are empowered to take responsibility for their own professional growth through the centre's well-designed appraisal process. Leaders and teachers effectively identify what is going well, and what would benefit from further improvement through the internal evaluation practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers need to formally evaluate the impact of their teaching practices as part of their individual reflections and to inform the centre's overall review findings.</p><p>To know how well the centre is achieving its philosophy and learning priorities, leaders and teachers should extend their internal evaluation to incorporate relevant aspects of these key documents into review topics.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mountainside Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mountainside Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>28 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
