</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dunsandel Playcentre operates under the guidance of the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative with parents being encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and playcentre management.</p><p>Dunsandel Playcentre is a small rural centre. It is situated across the road from the local school and is open for one session per week.</p><p>The community has become increasingly transient and culturally diverse due to changes in employment in the local area.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, the centre has had a significant decline in the roll. This has made it very difficult for the current small number of parents to meet all the recommendations in the last ERO report. This includes parent participation and building parents' knowledge and capability. The association has had close involvement and has supported parents to evaluate and improve ways to assess and plan for children's learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentres in the Canterbury Playcentre Association (CPA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are provided with a wide range of interesting learning activities and learning experiences. Adults support and extend children's learning by the way they present activities and the environment and make use of a range of good quality resources. The outdoor area is spacious and has a range of equipment that extends children's physical skills.</p><p>Adults play alongside children, enjoy positive relationships with other parents and encourage children's active exploration.</p><p>Adults make good use of the local community. Children have regular contact with the school and visit local businesses and the marae.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are valued and well provided for. The adults have set up a suitable play area that has a good range of appropriate resources for babies and young children.</p><p>The playcentre is committed to developing aspects of New Zealand's bicultural heritage in the environment, programme and resources. It is visible in the centre with some visual prompts to support parents' use of te reo and understanding of MƒÅori culture.</p><p>A small group of parents are strongly committed to successfully managing the play centre. They are involved with the association's parent education training programme. Parents share knowledge and skills and model practices for parents to engage children in learning. They make good use of the association's guidelines and systems to ensure effective management of the playcentre.</p><p>The Canterbury Playcentre Association has made significant progress since the 2014 ERO cluster review. They have implemented a strategic plan that effectively identifies goals, plans and progress. The centre support and education teams have been structured to provide more efficient and timely support and guidance for the centres. The parent education programme has become more accessible to parents. Noticeably more parents are participating in all levels of the training and are making good use of this new knowledge in the centres. The centre support team is successfully facilitating the sharing of useful knowledge and practices across centres.</p><p>The association has high expectations for every child to experience high quality education and all parents to be actively involved in parent education and the management of the centres. They have established some very useful systems and practices to ensure the sustainability and improvement of the organisation and the centres. This includes effective evaluation and monitoring of the quality of education for parents and improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The key next steps for the association are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review how the well individual playcentre philosophies are meeting the changing contexts of centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement appraisals for the members of the centre support team to align more closely with centre needs and association expectations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association, parents and ERO agree that the next steps for the playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding new planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation and strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop closer relationships with the marae to promote a better understanding of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dunsandel Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Actions for compliance</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to appraisal. To meet requirements the association needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement a system of regular appraisal for members of the Education Support Team.</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[Regulation 47 (GMA7) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dunsandel Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>2 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand.

ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
