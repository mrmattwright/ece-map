</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Redoubt North Kindergarten is a well-established service that provides education and care for children over two years old in Manukau, South Auckland. The kindergarten has operated the kindergarten day model since June 2012 which enables children to attend sessions that match school hours. The centre is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional practice manager (PPM) visits and provides management and curriculum support for teachers.</p><p>The multicultural teaching team reflects the diverse community. Most of the teachers have been in the kindergarten for several years and have established trusting relationships with families. The teachers, who are all fully registered, regularly participate in professional development opportunities together. This learning enhances their practice, helps teachers develop shared understandings of cultural differences and strengthens their skills with information and communication technologies (ICT).</p><p>In 2010 ERO identified many positive features of the service. Inclusive practices, strong literacy foundations and skilful teaching engaged children in programmes that fostered their problem solving skills and extended their interests. At this time ERO recommended teachers further develop their self-review processes, and improve assessment practices and programme documentation. Teachers have responded effectively to these challenges while sustaining their established good practices.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy to ‚Äòpromote a positive and culturally rich environment where everyone is of value and respected‚Äô is thoroughly enacted by teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are competent, independent learners. They arrive enthusiastic to engage in activities and quickly find an interest to explore. Despite many of them having English as a second or third language, children are articulate and readily converse with teachers and their peers. They confidently work alone or in culturally mixed groups and benefit from the rich variety of resources they can independently access. Teachers have high expectations that children will respect and help each other, keep play areas inviting and abide by agreed promises. In this inclusive environment children are valued for who they are, and several children with special needs are integrated and supported very well.</p><p>Teachers skilfully prompt children to be curious investigators. They use open questions very well to foster problem solving and challenge thinking, often encouraging tuakana/teina relationships and enabling the more capable children to tutor their peers. Teachers use mat time activities, singing and story reading very effectively to support children's language acquisition and early literacy skills. They also recognise the benefits of children using ICT as learning tools and teachers plan to further develop their own capacity to promote this aspect of their curriculum.</p><p>Families support the kindergarten very well. Teachers have established effective partnerships with the kindergarten community through an inclusive parent support group. Teachers also provide frequent family and cultural events, and extensive information about children's learning and kindergarten operations. Parents interviewed by ERO enthusiastically endorse the quality of children's learning, the warmth of relationships and the authenticity of cultural respect. Parents express appreciation for teachers who encourage first languages and value the experiences children bring to the kindergarten.</p><p>The head teacher leads a collaborative teaching team with a shared vision for learning. They communicate effectively and use complementary skills well to develop challenging projects to extend children's skills, knowledge and learning dispositions. Teachers are reflective practitioners who critique their work continually to improve their practices. They are building their capacity to assess children's learning and progress effectively. They recognise that strengthening the links between children's individual learning stories will help them to track progress better. More specific documentation of their teaching roles in extending play would enable teachers to better demonstrate their valuable contributions to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The kindergarten is well managed. The systems in place for centre operations, ongoing self review and association support contribute to efficient management of the service. Teachers are guided by their teaching and learning statement, the Association‚Äôs strategic goals and their own annual planning to promote sustained development. They use the appraisal process well to identify goals and are encouraged by their PPM to be innovative and reflective in their practices. A current review of the appraisal process at association level should result in further challenges for teachers to demonstrate their competency as teachers of MƒÅori learners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, the PPM and ERO agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers using their self-review processes to further develop their confidence and practices in relation to te reo, tikanga and te ao MƒÅori</li>
<li>building on children‚Äôs growing competence by helping them to set long term learning goals and assess their progress towards achieving them.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Redoubt North Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Redoubt North Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>28 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
