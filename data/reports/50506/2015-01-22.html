</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Educare is a privately owned education and care centre located in Moturoa, New Plymouth. The centre is licensed for 80 children, including 25 up to two years old. Full-time care and education is offered in areas designed for infants, toddlers and young children. Twenty-three percent of children enrolled identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>In 2014, there was a change in ownership. ABC Educare was previously operating under three separate licences, ABC Educare A, B and C. In 2012, the centre merged the licences and is now known as ABC Educare.</p><p>The new management structure includes the owner who is responsible for governance and management, the professional leader who mentors and leads change initiatives and team leaders who monitor the day-to-day running of the service. Many staff are long serving.</p><p>The teaching philosophy promotes respectful relationships, partnerships with parents and a homely learning environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a child-centred, play-based environment. A wide range of rich learning experiences is readily available. These experiences include regular excursions into the community. Clear and responsive routines provide a useful framework for the day. Children are purposefully engaged and sustained play is evident. Their independence and decision-making skills are fostered.</p><p>Teachers engage respectfully with children and their families. Interactions are warm and responsive. Children are knowledgeable about centre virtues and teachers model these to promote children‚Äôs social and emotional competence. Teachers work alongside children using effective teaching strategies to support their play and learning. These purposeful interactions help to extend cildren's ideas, engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>Learning journals show regular observations of children involved in everyday activities. They build a picture of what children know, understand and are interested in. Leaders have identified their next step is to highlight, through assessment, how teachers add depth and complexity to children‚Äôs learning. ERO agrees with this direction and identifies that teachers should further the intentional teaching of mathematics and reflect this through documentation.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are very well supported to learn happily and successfully alongside their peers. Where appropriate, teachers liaise with external agencies to assist in establishing a shared pathway for the child. Children are known well within the context of their families. Teachers take time to listen to children and skilfully incorporate new vocabulary, experiences and concepts into conversations.</p><p>A calm environment is a priority in the area for up to two year olds. Teachers respond to infants‚Äô early attempts at verbalising and use of language. Individual routines and preferences are responded to in a flexible manner.</p><p>Leaders are committed to developing culturally responsive relationships and supporting a sense of identity. Cultural guidance is being sought to develop a localised and considered approach. Bicultural practice is developing. At times, some teachers use te reo MƒÅori and aspects of tikanga MƒÅori within the programme. ERO agrees with leaders‚Äô identified next step to further develop teachers‚Äô confidence and competence in how they integrate MƒÅori and Pacific culture, language and identity throughout learning.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is evident in practice. The newly established leadership team is focused on building consistency of teaching across ABC Educare. The strategic plan provides goals and some outcomes for guiding future direction. The next step is to create clear and concise action plans to systematically monitor progress towards intended outcomes.</p><p>Leadership is committed to the professional growth of teachers to enhance learning opportunities for children. Self review is improvement focused and informed by research. Parents also contribute to the areas under review. This approach should continue to be strengthened through building leaders‚Äô understanding of consistent evaluation practice. The appraisal process fosters reflective practice. It is now timely to evaluate the effectiveness of this process in enhancing teachers‚Äô knowledge, confidence and practice. Leaders should also update and strengthen the alignment between policies and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen strategic planning and self review</li>
<li>further develop bicultural practice and support responsiveness to MƒÅori learners</li>
<li>build assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>review the effectiveness of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should ensure policies are regularly reviewed and updated. In addition, the centre owner should be regularly appraised.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer - Central Central Region</p><p>22 January 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
