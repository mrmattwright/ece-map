</table><p>Systems and practices at Frankton Kindergarten require further development to be effective.</p><p>The kindergarten needs significant ongoing support from the Central Otago Kindergarten Association (COKA) in order to be considered well placed.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children at Frankton Kindergarten come from a diverse range of nationalities. The kindergarten is located at the base of The Remarkables and beside the Kawarau River.</p><p>Since the February 2011 ERO report there have been a number of changes in staffing, including a new head teacher. The kindergarten has experienced an unsettled period with a high turnover of teachers. There are some long-serving and experienced teachers on the staff.</p><p>The kindergarten provides education and care for children from three-to-five years of age. Daily sessions run from 8.30am to 2.30pm.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified that assessment, planning and self review needed to be improved. ERO has found that these are still key areas for improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Central Otago Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ERO observed positive relationships between teachers and children. Children settled quickly after being warmly welcomed. They work and play alongside each other and in small groups. Parents feel comfortable and welcome in the kindergarten. Many choose to stay for short periods of time.</p><p>Children benefit from a variety of diverse and rich experiences teachers provide, such as boat building and using flowers in making soap, perfume and book marks. They play and learn in a well-resourced kindergarten environment. Teachers provide a variety of different spaces for children to choose to play and learn in.</p><p>Teachers respond well to children&rsquo;s interests and expand on these. They are respectful of children and hold genuine conversations with them. Children have uninterrupted time to play. They choose when they wish to eat and the activities they get involved in.</p><p><em>Governance</em></p><p>Over the past three years the Central Otago Kindergarten Association has gone through an unsettled period. There has been a break down in governance, management and systems which has adversely affected the effectiveness and level of leadership provided to each kindergarten. This has led to the board contracting Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens) in 2012 to undertake an independent review of the management structure. Then in September 2013, Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association was contacted again to provide management support and guidance in an effort to establish robust systems, competent leadership and management. The process for redevelopment is still underway. Overall, there has been a substantial turnover of teachers across the association. New systems are being established and at the time of this review, ERO found it was too early to tell how well they would be implemented. ERO also found that the association appraisal process was not robust and needs further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and teachers at Frankton Kindergarten need to develop systems to support purposeful planning, assessment, evaluation and self review. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing their philosophy to ensure it focuses on learning</li>
<li>describing what the philosophy means for children&rsquo;s learning and using this to guide teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to develop guidelines and procedures that will help them plan better for individual children and small-group learning. They need to record planning and assessment that acknowledges children&rsquo;s strengths and interests and includes:</p><ul>
<li>a stronger focus on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s next learning steps</li>
<li>what teachers will do to support children to achieve their next learning steps</li>
<li>parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>showing the continuity of children&rsquo;s learning and progress over time.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to evaluate programmes to show the difference they make to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers need to develop:</p><ul>
<li>a shared understanding of rigorous self review</li>
<li>a schedule for review so that all aspects of programmes and operations are reviewed over time</li>
<li>and use self review to improve what happens for children.</li>
</ul><p>The leadership needs to be strengthened to bring about sustainable improvements to what happens for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frankton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frankton Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>4 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
