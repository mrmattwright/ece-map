</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Rapa Early Education Centre is located in Hamilton and provides full day education and care for pre-school children aged from three months. The centre is licensed for up to 61 children. At the time of this ERO review, 58 children were enrolled, of whom six are identified as MƒÅori and nine of other ethnic groups. They operate in three age-group rooms. Staffing since the last ERO review has changed, while the centre manager and assistant centre manager have remained in their respective roles. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and has responded positively to the areas for review and development identified in the 2012 Education Review.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Early Education Waikato (EEW), which is a limited liability company with charitable status. The strategic direction of EEW is guided by the overarching vision, ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. EEW has a commitment to providing a quality, sustainable organisation that effectively meets the diverse educational needs of all children attending and provides strong outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Early Education Waikato designs centres with multiple child spaces and large playgrounds that can provide specific equipment, resources and physical and educational challenges to support children‚Äôs learning outcomes and fun.</p><p>Early Education Waikato is managed effectively and efficiently by an experienced leadership and administration team, who also manage the Waikato Kindergarten Association. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity.</p><p>The centre benefits from the EEW clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The long standing and well‚Äìrespected centre manager provides effective day-to-day centre management. She has developed reciprocal relationships with children and their families and established effective lines of communication at all levels. Her inclusive leadership style is enhancing the leadership capability of all staff. The centre benefits from the close relationship between the centre manager and the education services manager from EEW.</p><p>Teachers have collectively developed a curriculum that is founded on reciprocal and close relationships with children, families and strong connections with the community. The programme is underpinned by priorities that include:</p><ul>
<li><em>Enviroschools</em>, <em>Healthy Heart</em> and <em>Energise Under 5</em> programmes</li>
<li>responsive transitions for children and their families into, across the service and on to school</li>
<li>the meaningful integration of literacy and mathematics in response to children‚Äôs interests and strengths, and providing a sound foundation for future learning</li>
<li>the increasing presence and visibility of a MƒÅori perspective throughout the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The curriculum for young children in the Ruma Pepe is based on respectful teaching practice where primary caregivers/key teachers work with each child and their family. Teachers promote a peaceful quiet and calm environment where babies are unhurried and free to move at their own pace. Social competency and the 'Care Code' underpin teaching practice in the Toddler Room. In addition, the kindergarten children are encouraged to develop a sense of social responsibility.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs last review of the centre in 2012 identified assessment practice as an area for development and review. In response teachers have developed a sound centre-wide framework for assessment, planning and evaluation. Strengths of current assessment practice are:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for parents to share their ideas and aspirations for their children and receive regular information from teachers about their children‚Äôs interests and learning</li>
<li>effective planning that responds to children‚Äôs developing interests, community happenings and families‚Äô contributions</li>
<li>strong links between curriculum priorities and children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>The other area for development identified in ERO‚Äôs last report was self review. The centre manager and teachers have made significant progress in this area. Self review is now well defined, robust and in many cases results in improved teacher practice and learning outcomes for tamariki and whƒÅnau. A good example of this progress being the changes to food routines in the kindergarten, and transitions for babies.</p><p>Inclusive team work is a feature of team leaders approach to the education and care of children. Interactions and relationships between teachers and children are sensitive, positive and caring. ERO observed many examples of effective strategies where teachers engaged in learning conversations that acknowledges and extends children‚Äôs play, language and thinking.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In conjunction with centre management and the teaching team EEW now need to review systems and practices to further strengthen curriculum design and implementation, and contribute to improving continuity of learning outcomes for children up to three years of age.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Rapa Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Rapa Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
