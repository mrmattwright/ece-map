</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oaktree Kindergarten is located in Browns Bay on Auckland&rsquo;s North Shore. It is licensed to provide education and care for up to 40 children aged over three years. Children aged four to five years attend three days per week and those aged three to four years attend two days. Four qualified teachers make up the teaching team.</p><p>The centre philosophy statement identifies a strong commitment to developing relationships that embrace children, their families and the wider community. Inclusion, well-being and effective, open communication are seen as essential foundations to support children&rsquo;s learning. A strong commitment to bi-cultural practice is also evident.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the guidance of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association (NAKA). The Association provides the kindergarten with a framework of policies and procedures. A Teacher Services Manager regularly visits the kindergarten and offers the team useful professional support and guidance.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report acknowledged the quality programme being provided by skilled teachers. Other strengths identified were effective leadership, strategic planning and self review. Areas for development and review included developing children&rsquo;s numeracy skills in play, promoting the use of the environment to support children&rsquo;s learning, and using self review for continuous improvement. The team has responded in depth and well to these recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled and enjoy a very peaceful atmosphere. Teachers and children engage in quiet conversations that indicate strong relationships. Teachers sensitively introduce newer children to those with similar interests. They support the new children's developing social skills, and well-being.</p><p>The attractively presented, well resourced environment encourages exploration and children confidently make choices about their play. Skilled teachers support children to play for extended periods of time. The environment reflects the culturally diverse community and the provision of an inclusive programme.</p><p>The centre philosophy is very evident in practice and includes:</p><ul>
<li>the formation of a culturally diverse parent committee</li>
<li>children chatting in their home languages during play</li>
<li>the deep commitment to bi-cultural development seamlessly woven through all aspects of centre processes and programme planning.</li>
</ul><p>Parents spoken to by ERO shared their deep appreciation and respect for the teaching team and the programme.</p><p>Teachers strive to know children, families and their community well. They make very effective use of the local bus service, taking children in small groups to unique places of interest close by. These trips have allowed children to experience meaningful learning opportunities, particularly in the area of science, whilst becoming more aware of their natural surroundings.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre are effectively managed. Teachers are respectful of children&rsquo;s choices when they select a primary caregiver on first arriving at the centre. Sensitive interactions allow teachers to establish friendships and bonds with all children over time. All parents are invited to share their aspirations for their children on arrival and as they transition between the younger and older group. Effective relationships with local schools have been established.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s involvement in the Enviro Schools Project and a strong focus on sustainability has really engaged the children. Opportunities for them to learn mathematics, literacy and about the wider world have emerged from their involvement. Programme planning is multi-layered, incorporating and weaving together self review, children&rsquo;s interests, and the centre philosophy.</p><p>The outdoor environment has recently benefitted from a comprehensive review. This in-depth review has resulted in the creation of a beautiful and very natural space, successfully combining physical challenges with quiet garden areas. Natural materials also feature in abundance in the indoors amongst the clearly defined play areas.</p><p>A strong commitment to, and belief in, the processes of self review are evident across the team. Self review projects are purposeful and incorporate links to the philosophy statement, <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and strategic planning. Outcomes of review positively influence teaching practice. Shared understandings of quality practice underpin the self-review process.</p><p>The teachers expressed appreciation of the opportunities they have to act in a leadership capacity. Individual strengths are acknowledged and appreciated in an organisational culture strongly conducive to ongoing improvement. Teachers felt well supported by the levels of professional development and support offered by NAKA.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO supports the team&rsquo;s self identified next step to continue to develop appropriate responses for a diverse community, seeking to ask and understand the answers to the question &ldquo;<em>what does a competent child look like in your culture?&rdquo;</em></p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oaktree Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Oaktree Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
