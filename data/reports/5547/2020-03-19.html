</table><p>Oaktree Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oaktree Kindergarten is one of 15 early childhood services operating under the umbrella of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association (the association) now trading as <span lang="mi">Kaitiaki</span> Kindergartens. The service is licensed for 40 children aged over two years and serves a diverse ethnic community. Many families have English as a second language. Daily sessions are for a mixed-age group of children from three to five years.</p><p>A governing board sets strategic direction for the association. Management of the association‚Äôs affairs is the responsibility of the general manager (GM). Two professional practice leaders (PPL's) have oversight of teaching and learning, compliance, policy development and leadership. Day-to-day operation in this kindergarten is the responsibility of the head teacher who leads a team of four registered teachers.</p><p>Since the June 2015 ERO report, there has been turnover of personnel at management and senior leadership levels. There have been some changes in the teaching team over this period.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning teaching and learning emphasises the importance of empowerment, children‚Äôs holistic development, relationships, and family and community. The natural environment and sustainable practices are major focus areas in programmes and practices, and the kindergarten has achieved silver 'Enviroschool' status.</p><p>The previous ERO review findings agreed with the teaching team's identified development step: to continue to develop appropriate responses to the needs of its diverse community. Progress is evident in this area.</p><p>This review is one of nine in the Northern Auckland Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The learning environment is very well developed. Areas of play and work spaces are richly resourced and carefully organised to invite children's interest and participation. The expansive outdoor area is well designed to support the strong focus on respect for the environment and sustainability. Play spaces are highly interesting and challenging for children.</p><p>The emergent curriculum is largely child driven. Literacy, mathematics, nature, science and the arts are all integrated into the programme in meaningful ways. Children have opportunities to be leaders, experts and teachers in their own cultures (ako). Many are self-managing and independent learners who sustain their engagement for extended periods.</p><p>Teachers are responsive and respectful in their interactions with children. They are attuned to children's developing ideas and interests, supporting, as needed, through the use of strategies that encourage settling, collaboration, perseverance and problem solving. Positive guidance is used well to promote social competence and friendships. Older children are encouraged to support younger children. Development of responsive and reciprocal relationships with families is prioritised and seen as a foundation to sustaining children's active participation in the programme.</p><p>Commitment to bicultural practice is highly evident. The focus on te ao MƒÅori is promoting children's understanding in authentic and interesting ways. Teachers have identified that they want to further their understanding of <span lang="mi">mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori</span>, and what bicultural practice should look like in their multicultural community. Continuing to practise using <span lang="mi">te reo</span> and protocols in everyday ways, and seeking connections with <span lang="mi">mana whenua</span> to inform their approach, are ongoing focus areas.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate highly inclusive practices. Well-developed provision is in place for children with additional learning needs, with the association funding extra support for those who need it. Implementation of a suitably responsive approach to the wide range of cultures and ethnicities in the community is of high importance to teachers. Children's transitions into the service are focused on their individual needs. Teachers show commitment to continuing to strengthen their response to diverse learners.</p><p>A carefully-researched process that includes families, supports children's transition to primary school. The approach is responsive to parents' views and needs and includes collaboration with primary schools. Teachers should continue to seek ways of best sharing information about individuals with new entrant teachers to support continuity in children's learning over time.</p><p>Planning for group learning is well developed. It is focused on children's emerging ideas and questions, often sparked by a teacher provocation or special event. A displayed planning story evolves over time for everyone to see and reflect on. Ongoing teacher review and reflection identify achieved outcomes for children and next steps for consideration.</p><p>Individual children's learning journeys are effectively supported and recorded. Children display strong ownership of their portfolios, which include well written stories about their participation in the programme and aspects of their learning over time. Teachers also record a range of information about the value of play and the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> to support parents' understanding. An on-line programme is providing timely information for families about their children's learning and inviting their input. It is now important for teachers to further raise the profile of parents' aspirations in learning records.</p><p>Teachers are working well as a team, demonstrating an improvement focused and professional approach to their roles. Opportunities for them to develop their leadership skills are encouraged and taken up. Review is valued, research-based and results in better outcomes for children. To further improve their decision making, the team should adopt a more evaluative approach to review using measurable best practice indicators.</p><p>The association has some good processes in place to support teachers. These include an improved inquiry-based appraisal, targeted learning and development opportunities and access to PPLs' guidance. Assisting teachers to implement and embed the new policy framework and reporting requirements, and deciding on the form and function of the PPL role and how this will be enacted in kindergartens, are priorities.</p><p>With the appointment of a new board, GM and leadership team, significant work has been undertaken to review the existing management structures, processes and guidelines for operation, and improve accountability. The board and GM should continue to review and develop governance and operational roles and responsibilities, in consultation with teachers and the community, to support the sustainability of operation and ensure continuous improvement to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for teachers are to continue to develop their:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural programme for their multicultural community.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oaktree Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified and areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety, and governance and management. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage are secured.</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
