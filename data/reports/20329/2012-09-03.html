<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Three Bears Titirangi Childcare governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the July 2011 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>the quality of centre self review</li>
<li>the extent to which the programme reflects bicultural New Zealand</li>
<li>the extent to which the centre has systems in place to meet contractual and regulatory obligations, including personnel and health and safety</li>
<li>any other issues that arise in the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Three Bears Titirangi Childcare in West Auckland caters for up to twelve children aged from three months to five years old.</p><p>Children and their parents enjoy the family atmosphere of the centre. Teachers know the children well and have built positive relationships with families; some who have had a long term association with the centre.</p><p>Teachers cater well for the education and care of children. They provide easy access to appropriate resources to support children‚Äôs learning. Teachers make good provision for children‚Äôs early literacy and numeracy knowledge and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Relationships are positive and teachers respect children as competent and capable learners. Teachers are very responsive to children‚Äôs interests and foster these interests though good levels of discussion. They work closely with children and encourage them to direct their own play. Teachers help children access resources and teach new skills when appropriate.</p><p>The centre manager has made good use of ERO‚Äôs 2011 Education review report to guide improvements to centre operations and strengthen management systems. She has worked strategically and significant progress has been made in all areas of previous concern. Health and safety matters raised in the previous ERO report have been addressed.</p><p>Self review is developing and already informing centre planning. The manager has developed plans to improve the outdoor environment of the childcare centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The 2011 ERO report identified a number of areas that needed to be strengthened at the centre. It identified the need to improve management practices including self review, performance management and programme management. It also identified the need for the programme to better reflect bi-cultural New Zealand and to support the interests of the older children.</p><p>Three Bears Kindergarten‚Äôs manager/director met with ERO after the 2011 review. The managers then developed a plan that has successfully guided on-going improvement.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p><em>Self review.</em> Significant progress has been made to build self-review capacity at the centre. Centre mangers and staff have been involved in professional development to assist the development of self-review processes and understandings. New review strategies, involving teachers, have been trialled and refined. The centre‚Äôs philosophy and mission statement and many of their policies and procedures have been reviewed. The manager has identified topics for future self review and planned further professional development on self review.</p><p><em>Performance management.</em> The centre manager has made good progress in strengthening performance management practices. A new system of staff appraisal has been developed and is being used to support on-going improvement. Teachers‚Äô performance is appraised in relation to job descriptions and the registered teacher criteria.</p><p><em>Bicultural heritage.¬†</em>The centre has made progress in improving their bicultural practices. The Culture and Identity policy provides guidance for staff and is a useful policy against which practice can be reviewed. Teachers embrace some aspects of MƒÅori culture, including language, within the programme.</p><p><em>Programme management.</em> Teachers have a better understanding of planning assessment and evaluation. They are becoming more skilled at recognising and documenting children‚Äôs learning. They support children to develop their interests and adapt the programme as children‚Äôs interests change.</p><p><em>Health and safety.</em> The health and safety concerns in the 2011 ERO report have been addressed. Documents have been amended to meet requirements, and preparedness for earthquake and fire evacuations has been improved.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO and centre managers have agreed on the following areas for further improvement.</p><ul>
<li>The centre manager, who is a registered teacher, should consider how she will be appraised against the appropriate teaching criteria.</li>
<li>The centre manager should strengthen teachers‚Äô understanding of MƒÅori perspectives and promote these within the centre environment.</li>
<li>Teachers should continue to strengthen opportunities for children to learn about MƒÅori culture, including the use of te reo MƒÅori, within the programme</li>
<li>Teachers should improve their recording of children‚Äôs learning to show progress over time by documenting how they responded to identified next steps.</li>
<li>Teachers should strengthen their programme evaluation.</li>
<li>Teachers should find ways to record parents‚Äô contributions to children‚Äôs assessment, including information about children‚Äôs home cultures.</li>
</ul><a id="4-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>In order to improve practice the centre manager should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>shelving and items are secure so that they cannot fall in the event of an earthquake</li>
<li>fire exits from the outdoor area are easily negotiated</li>
<li>police vetting procedures are consistently followed.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>3 September 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

Teachers make good provision for children‚Äôs early literacy and numeracy knowledge and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Relationships are positive and teachers respect children as competent and capable learners. Teachers are very responsive to children‚Äôs interests and foster these interests though good levels of discussion. They work closely with children and encourage them to direct their own play. Teachers help children access resources and teach new skills when appropriate.</p><p>The centre manager has made good use of ERO‚Äôs 2011 Education review report to guide improvements to centre operations and strengthen management systems. She has worked strategically and significant progress has been made in all areas of previous concern. Health and safety matters raised in the previous ERO report have been addressed.</p><p>Self review is developing and already informing centre planning. The manager has developed plans to improve the outdoor environment of the childcare centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p>
