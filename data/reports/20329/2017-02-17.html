</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Three Bears Titirangi Childcare is located in West Auckland, operating in an adapted residential home. It is licensed for 12 children with a maximum of 12 under two years of age. The centre re-opened in term one, 2016 after being closed for six months for restructuring to better cater for children under two years of age.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted that children and parents enjoyed the family atmosphere of the centre. It recognised the positive relationships between teachers, children and families. These features continue to be evident.</p><p>The manager and teachers have responded well to the recommendations in ERO's 2012 report. They have continued to explore ways to strengthen bicultural practice and programme planning, assessment and evaluation of children's learning. Areas of non-compliance have all been addressed.</p><p>Teachers place importance on providing a "home-away-from-home setting, respectful relationships and a culture of love and kindness". The centre aims to be a unique and special place for children and families where children are at the heart of the matter.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Three Bears Titirangi Childcare provides high quality education and care for children in a calm and peaceful learning environment. The centre's philosophy is very well enacted and strongly reflected in programmes and teacher practice.</p><p>Inclusive and respectful relationships with families and children support children's sense of belonging and wellbeing in the centre. Teachers continue to enhance the centre rituals that also promote wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Children have easy access to indoor and outdoor environments that focus on the natural world, are appropriately resourced and encourage exploration and self-management skills. Comfortable, safe spaces are provided for infants who are not yet mobile.</p><p>Children benefit from teachers' integration of te reo and tikanga Māori throughout the daily programme. Teachers have a genuine commitment to developing a bicultural curriculum. They know children and families well and report that Māori whānau support the use of te reo and tikanga Māori in the centre. Teachers continue to respond to and affirm families' diverse languages and cultures.</p><p><em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and principles of Magda Gerber and Dr Emmi Pikler guide the programme. Learning environments enable children to be challenged within secure and homely surroundings. Teachers are responsive to children's needs and interests through a nurturing and gentle approach. Children's assessment records show their learning and development over time. Teachers continue to enhance and document planning, assessment and evaluation practices.</p><p>Teachers have a good understanding of children's learning development. There is a deliberate approach to working at the pace of each child in an unhurried and meaningful way. Teachers have a carefully considered approach to transitions into and out of the centre.</p><p>The manager and teachers have established a culture that supports ongoing improvement. Internal evaluation is well documented and informs future decision making. Formal, planned internal evaluations that consider routines and rituals, and planning, assessment and evaluation, have been identified for the near future.</p><p>Opportunities for shared leadership roles are being established. This is underpinned by current professional development on teacher motivation and leadership. A thorough teacher appraisal process is documented.</p><p>The manager is developing long-term and annual plans to guide centre operations. This step is supported by a policy framework that is up to date and meaningful. The manager and teachers are building their capacity to sustain, and continue building on, current good practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager agrees that key next steps are to continue developing systems and processes introduced in the past year, and to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learning partnerships with parents/whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the concept of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) to promote care for the centre, community and planet earth</p>
</li>
<li>the manager's appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Three Bears Titirangi Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Three Bears Titirangi Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
