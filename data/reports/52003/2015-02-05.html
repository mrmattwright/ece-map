</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Milson Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association‚Äôs playcentres during term 4, 2014.</p><p>The centre is open for four mornings per week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid team leader supports parents and whƒÅnau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members‚Äô practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><p>Since the April 2012 ERO report, Milson Playcentre has spent some time without the support of a team leader. Parents have worked collectively to manage operation and plan the children‚Äôs programme. There has been a strong focus on raising qualification levels to better support selfmanagement. This has resulted in the recent appointment of a team leader from within the parent group. Most parents at this centre are currently undertaking Playcentre training.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together‚Äô, encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whƒÅnau working collectively to support children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents and whƒÅnau work well as a team to engage children‚Äôs interest and involvement in activities. High ratios of adults to children promote opportunities for one-to-one interaction. The team leader is strongly focused on supporting language and social development. Children are confident, cooperative and friendly. Increasing adults‚Äô use of specific strategies that support learning through play, should strengthen the reflection of the Playcentre philosophy in the programme. Giving children more opportunities to initiate and direct the programme is likely to further empower them as learners.</p><p>The environment provides good support for development of a variety of learning experiences for children. A wide range of well-organised resources is freely available for children to access and investigate. The outdoor area continues to be improved to support physically active play and adventure. Further developing displays that enable children to see their work and reflect on their achievements would be an appropriate next step.</p><p>Experience in supporting a child with complex learning needs has strengthened inclusive practice in the centre. There is good knowledge of local agencies and suitable strategies that promote these children‚Äôs and their families‚Äô active participation in the playcentres' programme. Members agree there remains a need to develop understanding of practices that value and support families from a wider range of cultures and ethnic groups.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are valued participants in daily sessions, learning alongside the older children. Members continue to add to the range of materials and equipment specifically for their use.</p><p>Progress has been made in integrating a more bicultural perspective into the programme and environment. Members‚Äô use of te reo and understanding of tikanga MƒÅori are developing. Children are learning waiata and ways to respond to the language and some protocols. Continuing to deepen understanding of te ao MƒÅori is an agreed development focus. The association should give priority to supporting members to define their understanding of success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</p><p>Members are seeking to improve liaison and consultation with local schools. This should promote the sharing of information about children and help to refine the centre‚Äôs approach to supporting families moving on to primary school.</p><p>Children‚Äôs developing interests in the activity-based programme are regularly discussed and noted. Daily evaluation meetings are well used by the duty team for reflection and planning. Term meetings give parents the opportunity to set goals and share their aspirations for their children. Children‚Äôs portfolios record some special learning moments linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Increased participation of parents in assessment and planning for learning is encouraged by the core group of more experienced members. More of a focus on identifying and supporting individual children‚Äôs significant learning and progress should strengthen programme quality.</p><p>Strong and committed leadership by a core group of members is supporting good practice and positive outcomes for children. A useful range of centre-generated documents outlines expectations for development of the programme. Mutual support and an emphasis on relationship-building are fostering parents‚Äô confidence and willingness to become involved. A new plan to support stronger parent and whƒÅnau involvement, and the wellbeing and learning of everyone at the centre, is ready for implementation. It is timely to further develop the centre philosophy and strategic goals alongside this plan, to support shared understanding of values, principles and priorities that will underpin learning programmes for children.</p><p>Daily discussion and collaborative reflection on the programme provide good support for decisions about activities for children. Members‚Äô understanding and collective participation in self review needs development to support more effective decision-making linked to improvement.</p><p>The association provides useful support. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finances and legislative obligations. Work is being completed on improving employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach. The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members‚Äô understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>liaison support, so this is consistently effective in identifying and responding to centre needs</li>
<li>appraisal for employees</li>
<li>members‚Äô understanding of te ao MƒÅori</li>
<li>shared understanding around the concept of success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori</li>
<li>strategies that promote awareness of Playcentre in the local community.</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>gaining all members‚Äô participation in assessment, planning , evaluation and self review</li>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy</li>
<li>empowering children to be independent leaders of their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Milson Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance in relation to police vetting.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Education Act requirements for police vetting of employees are consistently met.¬†<em>[</em><em>Education Act 1989, sections 78CB and CC]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Milson Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>5 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</span></h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
