</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tokomairiro Early Learning Centre on Spenser (TELC) is one of the two education and care community centres in the rural town of Milton governed by the TELC committee. It provides care and learning opportunities for children from infancy to age six. The centre has been open for two and a half years. At the time of this review a new outdoor playground was under construction. ERO‚Äôs visit was during the end of term holidays and the number of children at the centre was low. Some of the permanent teachers were on holiday and relieving teachers worked with the children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy that drives the learning at TELC is based on teachers building meaningful relationships with children and their families. ERO saw children settling quickly into the centre and demonstrating a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers had positive interactions with parents about children and how to support their learning.</p><p>During ERO‚Äôs time at the centre children played well together and made good use of the resources available to them. The teachers‚Äô interactions with children were positive and affirming. They supported children‚Äôs interests, affirmed their strengths and encouraged them to develop and learn.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to develop independence. They are responsive to children‚Äôs verbal and non-verbal cues. Very young children are encouraged to explore and follow their own direction for learning. These infants receive a high level of care and there are good communication systems in place to ensure parents are kept well informed about their child‚Äôs care and learning.</p><p>The children‚Äôs profile books show that they have a variety of opportunities to learn. Most teachers clearly identify learning, its significance and how they will extend this further. The older children are well supported with routines and learning activities to help prepare them for school.</p><p>The teachers value te ao MƒÅori. ERO observed the integration of some tikanga practices and the use of regular phrases in te reo MƒÅori. Children are becoming familiar with these and show a good understanding of what is used. MƒÅori culture is valued and evident in the environment.</p><p>The head teacher is establishing a collaborative, collegial model of leadership. She has begun to establish her expectations for teaching as well as define various roles and responsibilities. She makes good use of the strengths of the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the leadership team agree that the centre continues the development of systems to support:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, programme planning, implementation and evaluation</li>
<li>processes around consultation and reporting to parents about their child‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>self-review processes and practices, and the implementation of a schedule of planned reviews that include all aspects of the service that impact on children.</li>
</ul><p>The manager and head teacher need to further develop systems to manage and guide centre practices. The systems should provide ways to monitor progress toward goals that are focused on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The governing committee and centre manager have yet to fully develop the centre‚Äôs strategic plan. The plan needs to have clear links to the annual plan and the centre philosophy and provide detail around how the centre vision will be achieved over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tokomairiro Early Learning Centre on Spenser completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tokomairiro Early Learning Centre on Spenser will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>22 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>

<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
