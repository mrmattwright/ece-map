<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Hataitai Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>The teaching team is well led by the head teacher and staff changes have been managed capably. Collaborative discussion and high expectations for success contribute to the development of good teamwork.</p>
<p>Whanaungatanga (maintaining wh&#257;nau and community relationships) is considered paramount to teaching, learning and operation. The importance of manaaki (a culture of care) is emphasised and contributes to the climate that supports cooperation and peaceful play.</p>
<p>Teachers provide a stimulating programme that promotes individual children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and positive dispositions. Organisation for teaching and learning acknowledges children as confident and competent. Cultural diversity is embraced. Commitment to the development of a bicultural approach is strong. Teachers&rsquo; gentle, respectful and inclusive approach provides effective support for children&rsquo;s social development and learning. Positive guidance is used well and consistently applied. Sound teaching strategies and learning conversations support sustained learning.</p>
<p>The curriculum includes a varied range of learning opportunities for children. Provision for creative, open-ended play is well developed. Routines and transitions provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing independence in self care. Mathematics, science and investigative learning experiences are integrated appropriately in the context of play and everyday events. Support for children&rsquo;s developing understanding of language and literacy is a major strength. The physical environment is richly resourced and carefully arranged to promote children&rsquo;s interest and exploration.</p>
<p>ERO, staff and the senior teacher have agreed on priority areas for development and review. Continuing to build self-review capacity should aid decision making about change. Staff are also committed to further development of their approach to assessment, planning and the M&#257;ori perspective in the programme.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Hataitai Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atHataitai Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>association support.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since the 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has been relicensed as an all-day service and ratios of teachers to children have increased to 1:10. For two days the programme is for the Tui group, children primarily aged three years, and for the other three, Pohutukawa group, those primarily aged four.</p>
<p>Only the head teacher remains from the time of the previous ERO review. Four new teachers have been appointed, two of whom are provisionally registered and commenced their employment just prior to this review.</p>
<p>Property development includes significant refurbishment indoors. Future priorities include the development of the outdoor play space. However, the new Hataitai tunnel may impact on these plans.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>The tone of sessions reflects the purposeful and sustained engagement of adults and children in shared learning experiences. Teachers are gentle, respectful and inclusive, providing effective support for children&rsquo;s social development and learning. They show high levels of engagement with children, taking a carefully considered approach to participation in their play. Positive guidance is used well and consistently applied.</p>
<p>Sound teaching strategies and learning conversations support persistence and sustained learning. Tuakana/teina (older helping younger) is fostered. Children&rsquo;s experiences and their teaching of others is valued and built upon. The importance of manaaki (a culture of care) is emphasised and contributes to the climate that supports cooperation and peaceful play.</p>
<p>The programme strongly reflects the values and aspirations outlined in the philosophy statement. Teachers are committed to providing a stimulating curriculum that promotes individuals&rsquo; strengths, interests and positive dispositions. Organisation for teaching and learning acknowledges children as confident and competent. Cultural diversity is embraced. Commitment to the development of a bicultural approach is strong.</p>
<p>Whanaungatanga (maintaining wh&#257;nau and community relationships) is considered paramount to the development of teaching, learning and operation. Parents Since the 2008 ERO review, considerable emphasis has been placed on strengthening relationships with families. Partnership is fostered through ongoing care warmly welcomed and their input is valued.ommunication and consultation.</p>
<p>The curriculum is broad and well implemented. Provision for creative, open-ended play is highly developed. Routines and transitions provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing independence in self care. Mathematics is integrated appropriately in the context of play and everyday experiences. Science and investigative learning opportunities are afforded through involvement of children in the garden and investigation of the wide range of natural materials and resources at the centre. Kotahitanga time is well used to promote children&rsquo;s understanding of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. Planned trips and special visitors strengthen current interests and link the programme and community in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Support for children&rsquo;s developing understanding of language and literacy is a strength. Learning experiences are presented in meaningful contexts. Interesting ways to motivate children to try writing and explore writing tools are created and promoted. The sharing of books and stories is a regular and much enjoyed aspect of sessions.</p>
<p>Photographs and narratives are displayed in a variety of ways to enable parents to be informed about aspects of the programme, teachers to develop their assessment records and children to reflect on their learning. Children&rsquo;s portfolios provide rich accounts of individual children&rsquo;s interests, participation in the programme and aspects of their learning over time. Narratives highlight their developing learning dispositions. Contributions from parents are sought and valued as part of the planning process for individuals. Children, parents and wh&#257;nau display strong ownership of these valuable learning records.</p>
<p>The physical environment is richly resourced and carefully arranged to promote children&rsquo;s interest and exploration. It appropriately reflects the diversity of cultures attending the kindergarten and te ao M&#257;ori. Work areas are spacious and support sustained play. The multilevel outdoor area includes gardens and a range of equipment to provide opportunities for development of motor skills and physical challenge. Children show respect for this environment which is fostering their motivation for, and independence in, learning.</p>
<p>Teachers are highly reflective and value self review as a tool to promote improvement. Formal self review is comprehensive, usually triggered in response to issues or new ideas. A suitable framework is in place to support teachers&rsquo; practice which includes the use of sound quality indicators to define and measure progress. Parent/wh&#257;nau input is an integral part of review processes.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>From professional discussion the team has identified the need for enhancement of:</p>
<ul><li>self review to better inform decision making and align with the association&rsquo;s long term planning processes</li>
<li>bicultural perspectives in the programme through more effective integration of te reo M&#257;ori and development of purposeful links with the local M&#257;ori community</li>
<li>liaison with local schools for the sharing of information about programmes, children&rsquo;s assessment and curriculum</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation to include more of a focus on showing continuity and progression of learning; exploring ways of promoting and recording children&rsquo;s self assessment; and better illustrating added breadth and complexity in relation to children&rsquo;s interests and learning dispositions</li>
<li>documentation of group learning to better align with children&rsquo;s developing ideas and theories; using reflective questions to promote evaluation of planning stories; and developing more current displays of documentation and information to enable parents to be conversant with programme developments.</li>
</ul><p>EROs external evaluation concurs with these enhancements.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback.</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has several children enrolled with moderate to severe needs. All were identified prior to enrolment and detailed information about their needs was provided.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<ul><li>Ably led by the head teacher, staff and the education support worker operate as a team to consistently respond to the particular learning and socialisation needs of children.</li>
<li>The highly inclusive nature of the centre promotes awareness in children to respect and value friendships with their peers.</li>
<li>Strong liaison with parents and external agencies helps to ensure children are well catered for through the implementation of individual programmes.</li>
<li>Transition to school is well managed with parental involvement regarded as integral to the process. Teachers take steps which effectively prepare children for the change.</li>
</ul><h3>Area for development and review</h3>
<p>It would be timely for teachers to evaluate their approach to inform decision making about possible improvements.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Hataitai Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p>
<ul><li>ensure that impact surfacing under the swings still meets safety requirements.</li>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-hataitai-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Hataitai Kindergarten</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Hataitai Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Hataitai Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>The teaching team is well led by the head teacher and staff changes have been managed capably. Collaborative discussion and high expectations for success contribute to the development of good teamwork.</p>
<p>Whanaungatanga (maintaining wh&#257;nau and community relationships) is considered paramount to teaching, learning and operation. The importance of manaaki (a culture of care) is emphasised and contributes to the climate that supports cooperation and peaceful play.</p>
<p>Teachers provide a stimulating programme that promotes individual children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and positive dispositions. Organisation for teaching and learning acknowledges children as confident and competent. Cultural diversity is embraced. Commitment to the development of a bicultural approach is strong. Teachers&rsquo; gentle, respectful and inclusive approach provides effective support for children&rsquo;s social development and learning. Positive guidance is used well and consistently applied. Sound teaching strategies and learning conversations support sustained learning.</p>
<p>The curriculum includes a varied range of learning opportunities for children. Provision for creative, open-ended play is well developed. Routines and transitions provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing independence in self care. Mathematics, science and investigative learning experiences are integrated appropriately in the context of play and everyday events. Support for children&rsquo;s developing understanding of language and literacy is a major strength. The physical environment is richly resourced and carefully arranged to promote children&rsquo;s interest and exploration.</p>
<p>ERO, staff and the senior teacher have agreed on priority areas for development and review. Continuing to build self-review capacity should aid decision making about change. Staff are also committed to further development of their approach to assessment, planning and the M&#257;ori perspective in the programme.</p>
<a id="future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
