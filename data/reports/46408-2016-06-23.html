</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Super Kids Learning Centre in Flat Bush was opened in April 2014. The centre provides education and care for up to 39 children including up to 10 under two years of age. It is one of two early childhood education centres in South Auckland under the same ownership. This is the first report for the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children are from diverse cultural backgrounds. Many are new to New Zealand. The centre occupies a purpose-built structure in a growing suburb.</p><p>Children play in two age-related groups, with opportunities to play as a mixed age group in the outdoor area. Transition into the centre is managed effectively by centre staff and links have been forged with local primary schools.</p><p>The multicultural teaching team has eight qualified teachers plus three support staff. Centre leaders have led internal professional development (PLD) to improve teaching practice. External PLD has been used to progress teacher and centre goals.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy of valuing the uniqueness of each child underpins teacher‚Äôs commitment to provide a welcoming environment. Staff are building respectful and trusting relationships with children and their parents to reflect this philosophy. As a result, the children have a good sense of belonging and settle quickly into play. Teachers affirm children in their play and support parents to know more about how young children learn and develop.</p><p>Children explore their surroundings and equipment, and experiment with the resources and activities provided for them. They engage in sustained play and frequently work cooperatively and collaboratively on their shared activities and projects. The planned upgrade of the outdoor area will provide children with more opportunities to be physically active with a wider range of resources and challenges.</p><p>Teachers supervise and interact appropriately with infants and toddlers and manage their primary care well. They recognise the importance of consistency and continuity in the care and education of young children. Primary caregivers for individual children contribute to the secure foundation for children‚Äôs development within the centre. Children under two years play in a separate area. Leaders could now review the lay-out and resourcing of this area to improve learning experiences for children.</p><p>Teachers attend and respond to children well. They encourage their participation in programmes and invite them to contribute.</p><p>Programme planning and assessment focuses on providing for individuals within a centre theme. Planning is used well to extend learning opportunities for children on these common themes. Teachers document the learning that occurs during play. These records would be strengthened by greater recognition of children‚Äôs cultures and by showing the continuity of learning for individual children more explicitly. Extending the programme evaluation process to focus on the impact of teaching practices on children‚Äôs learning should also help teachers to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The teaching team works well together to implement change. They benefit from professional learning and development provided by centre leaders. Through evaluative review, they reflect on their practice and its impact on children‚Äôs learning. They could now strengthen their planning for teaching in specific curriculum areas like promoting well-being.</p><p>Staff reflect the diverse community of the centre and many languages are used by both teachers and children in the programme. Children and teachers celebrate cultural events throughout the year. Leaders identified the need to continue to develop teachers' bicultural practices and to increase the evidence of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the environment.</p><p>Staff appreciate the centre owner's active involvement in many aspects of the centre's organisation. The current strategic plan has specific goals that prioritise good educational outcomes for children through the building of teacher capability. Self review of centre programmes, systems and operations promotes improvement. The self-review process could now benefit from a more evaluative approach.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agreed that the next steps to improve outcomes for children includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the quality of provision for toddlers and infants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>putting children‚Äôs learning dispositions and skills to the fore of programme planning and learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teachers' understanding of how to extend children's learning, especially through promoting creativity, thinking and problem solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher planning that builds on individual children's interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy to align induction and teaching practice to the centre‚Äôs goals set in the strategic and annual plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing their teacher appraisal policy to ensure it fully meets legislative requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Super Kids Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Super Kids Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:¬†</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education¬†</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
