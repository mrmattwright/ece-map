</table><p>The Rainbow Early Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rainbow Early Learning Centre is a Christian, community-based centre governed by the Person To Person Help Trust. It provides a full-day service and is licenced for 48 children, including 12 aged under two years. The centre is led by a long-serving head teacher with a team leader, and all teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The separate nursery and preschool areas each have adjacent indoor and outdoor areas. Interaction between older and younger children, including siblings, is encouraged.</p><p>The centre has made progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the October 2016 review, particularly improving the quality of planning and assessment practices.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is Christian-centred and underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It states that through play-based and child-led programmes children are supported to be competent and confident learners, and that the service values reciprocal learning relationships with families. It also says that the cultural background of each child, and the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua will be valued.</p><p>The Rainbow Early Learning Centre is a member of the Katote KƒÅhui Ako | Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children actively lead their own learning, empowering them to grow in competence and confidence physically, emotionally, cognitively and socially. Teachers respond to individual learning needs through effective curriculum planning and assessment. Te ao MƒÅori and Christian concepts are clearly aligned with outcomes from <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to help determine learning. MƒÅori children are well supported in their learning.</p><p>Assessment records children‚Äôs strengths, interests and learning dispositions, and demonstrates progress in a range of contexts. Parents' and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children are known and valued. Teachers proactively learn about, and respond to, children‚Äôs cultural values.</p><p>Teachers engage in positive, responsive relationships with children. Their conversations with children, which also incorporate some te reo MƒÅori, meaningfully promote curiosity, social engagement and learning. Teachers provide authentic learning experiences that offer opportunities to learn within and about the local community. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is nurtured, with close whƒÅnau involvement, through individualised transitions into and within the service, and when moving on to school.</p><p>Infants experience warm, caring interactions with their key teachers. Their routines are calm and unhurried. The initiative of the child is respected, and their learning environment provides stimulation and challenge.</p><p>The centre's extensive learning environment supports curriculum implementation and makes use of many natural resources that invite exploration, wondering and creativity. Children experience the care of animals and sustainable practices that foster responsibility and gentleness. They are encouraged to take responsibility for their own and others' wellbeing and their environment.</p><p>Trustees, leaders and teachers demonstrate a strong, shared understanding of, and commitment to, the centre‚Äôs Christian philosophy. They provide an inclusive education for children with diverse needs through their collaborative practices and continual learning. The Trust resources the centre well as part of its mission of service and equity in its community. Leaders and teachers provide emotional and practical support and advocacy for children and whƒÅnau. Children are valued, affirmed and celebrated for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers are active participants and contributors to the wider education community. This has led to improvements in building cultural responsiveness and positive transitions to school. Professional learning is enhanced by teacher inquiry practices and sharing new knowledge within the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to continue to focus on:</p><ul>
<li>engaging with parents and whƒÅnau throughout the process of undertaking planned inquiries and evaluations for improvement</li>
<li>effectively evaluating service practices, including changes to practice, and key developments to determine the impact these have had on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rainbow Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should ensure that parents are notified in a timely manner in the event of their child sustaining an injury.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>27 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
