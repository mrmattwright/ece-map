<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Waimauku Kindergarten is situated in a semi-rural community close to Waimauku school. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides a useful and updated framework of policies and procedures as well as management of employment, property maintenance and finance administration.</p><p align="left">Children are respected by teachers as confident and capable learners. Using a wide range of resources, children develop and sustain complexity in their play. They are developing effective social skills and are inclusive of others in their play. Children benefit from positive and supportive relationships with their teachers, who encourage them to create, experiment and investigate.</p><p align="left">Caring and respectful teachers plan programmes that are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers support children well and ensure that routines are flexible. Children&rsquo;s learning is clearly documented in attractive portfolios. Teachers use self review to inform programme planning and kindergarten decision making.</p><p align="left">Teachers build partnerships with children and their families through open communication. Some families have a long association with the teachers and kindergarten. Parent participation in the programme promotes the friendly, community atmosphere of the centre. The well organised committee of parents and wh&#257;nau supports teachers and raises funds for additional resources.</p><p align="left">The head teacher and teaching team continue to provide a high quality programme for children. Effective leadership and professional development is well used to achieve and sustain further improvements. Teachers are reviewing ways to reflect diversity in the programme and are building a more useful parent web portal to further enhance partnerships with families. It would also be useful for teachers to refine their processes for strategic planning for the long-term development of the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Waimauku Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWaimauku Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO report found that teachers provided a high quality programme. Teachers have used the 2008 ERO review to refine the management of portfolios, increase parent understanding of best practice, and broaden the focus of self review.</p><p align="left">Since 2010, the kindergarten has offered a six hour day and has continued to provide programmes to meet the needs of the community.</p><p align="left">The experienced head teacher continues to provide effective leadership and support for the teaching team. An additional teacher has been employed as part of the change to longer hours.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Quality interactions.</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from trusting, respectful and caring relationships with adults and each other. They play well in groups and include each other. Good quality interactions support children to communicate effectively, develop a range of useful social and emotional skills, and to make independent decisions.</p><h4 align="left">Child-centred programme.</h4><p align="left">The programme is effectively designed around children&rsquo;s interests. Children are respected as capable, confident learners. Routines remain flexible so that children can initiate and sustain complex play. Teachers support children&rsquo;s play as they work alongside them to promote thinking, talking and exploration. Children have good opportunities to revisit their play.</p><h4 align="left">Portfolios.</h4><p align="left">Attractive portfolios are useful records of children&rsquo;s learning. Individual children&rsquo;s learning and interests are clearly reflected in learning stories. Group stories and planning are particularly effective and are shared with parents/wh&#257;nau and children in a number of ways. Portfolios are highly valued and are readily accessible to children.</p><h4 align="left">Learning environments.</h4><p align="left">Teachers provide children with stimulating, learning environments. Outdoor spaces feature high quality natural resources that add challenge to children&rsquo;s play. Children also have many opportunities to experience meaningful learning of knowledge and skills in literacy and science and to engage in thoughtful problem solving. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are used to enhance children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4 align="left">Philosophy in practice.</h4><p align="left">Key elements of the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy are clearly evident in the ways in which adults and children work together and have developed a community of learning and exploration. Children benefit from an inclusive and welcoming environment that promotes their sense of belonging. Teachers are developing their skills in te reo M&#257;ori and are exploring more ways to represent the diversity of all learners in the daily programme.</p><h4 align="left">Partnerships with families.</h4><p align="left">Parents and wh&#257;nau are warmly greeted and welcomed into the kindergarten. Parents report that they appreciate information shared in children&rsquo;s learning portfolios and in frequent conversations with teachers. Partnerships are fostered through open communication and the sharing of expertise. Families have good opportunities to participate in the programme and parent committee.</p><h4 align="left">Effective leadership and useful self review.</h4><p align="left">The head teacher provides effective leadership. Professional development is well used to enhance teachers&rsquo; skills and parents&rsquo; understanding of good practice in early childhood care and education. Positive and cohesive working relationships enable all teachers to engage in self review that leads to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4 align="left">Building success as and for M&#257;ori.</h4><p align="left">Teachers have engaged in some professional learning to build their understanding of biculturalism and te reo M&#257;ori. ERO and teachers agree that it would be useful to:</p><ul>
<li>use the Ministry of Education document, Ka Hikitia: Managing for Success, as a tool for evaluating progress and determining future strategic planning</li>
<li>continue to develop teachers&rsquo; confidence and skills in using te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>ask parents and wh&#257;nau to help the centre to develop links with local iwi</li>
<li>include more perspectives of te ao M&#257;ori in the programme.</li>
<li>Individual programme documentation. ERO and teachers agree that it would be beneficial for children if teachers continued to focus on:</li>
<li>increasing programme planning for individual children</li>
<li>further documenting individual children&rsquo;s progress</li>
<li>increasing the use of parent and wh&#257;nau input in portfolios.</li>
</ul><h4 align="left">Strategic planning.</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten has recently developed a strategic plan. To enhance the usefulness of the plan, ERO and the teachers agree that the next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>adding measurable indicators and specific timeframes for successful attainment of goals</li>
<li>regularly recording progress towards the achievement of strategic goals.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><ul>
<li>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</li>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service, the kindergarten is well prepared to provide for their needs. In the past, teachers have provided effective support for children with special needs and for their families.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Waimauku Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the teachers agree that teachers should:</p><div><ol>
<li>
<p align="left">continue to improve their documentation of individual children&rsquo;s learning, expand bicultural practices, and refine processes for strategic planning.</p>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="parents-and-community-of-waimauku-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Waimauku Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Waimauku Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Waimauku Kindergarten is situated in a semi-rural community close to Waimauku school. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides a useful and updated framework of policies and procedures as well as management of employment, property maintenance and finance administration.</p><p align="left">Children are respected by teachers as confident and capable learners. Using a wide range of resources, children develop and sustain complexity in their play. They are developing effective social skills and are inclusive of others in their play. Children benefit from positive and supportive relationships with their teachers, who encourage them to create, experiment and investigate.</p><p align="left">Caring and respectful teachers plan programmes that are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers support children well and ensure that routines are flexible. Children&rsquo;s learning is clearly documented in attractive portfolios. Teachers use self review to inform programme planning and kindergarten decision making.</p><p align="left">Teachers build partnerships with children and their families through open communication. Some families have a long association with the teachers and kindergarten. Parent participation in the programme promotes the friendly, community atmosphere of the centre. The well organised committee of parents and wh&#257;nau supports teachers and raises funds for additional resources.</p><p align="left">The head teacher and teaching team continue to provide a high quality programme for children. Effective leadership and professional development is well used to achieve and sustain further improvements. Teachers are reviewing ways to reflect diversity in the programme and are building a more useful parent web portal to further enhance partnerships with families. It would also be useful for teachers to refine their processes for strategic planning for the long-term development of the centre.</p></html>
