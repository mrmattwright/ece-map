<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Explorers Early Learning Centre is a privately owned early childhood care and education centre licensed for up to 36 children over the age of two. It is situated in Hamilton East and has been operating for four years.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy and vision are inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach. According to the centre's philosophy, this approach values strong relationships among teachers, children, family and wh&#257;nau. There is an emphasis on children engaging in joint problem solving and projects in small groups and pairs. Another feature of this approach is its view of teachers as researchers and facilitators alongside children. Recently a new timetable and new ways of planning have been put in place that more clearly reflect the Reggio Emilia approach.</p>
<p>Since the previous ERO review in 2010 there has been a change in head teacher and teaching staff. There has also been staff restructuring.</p>
<h3>Review Findings</h3>
<p>ERO observed respectful and affirming interactions among adults and children at the centre. Teachers model positive guidance to children in a quiet and respectful manner and effectively develop their social skills. Children were very settled in their play and had a strong sense of belonging. There were many opportunities for younger children to learn from their older peers. Through group work teachers focussed on developing children&rsquo;s skills and knowledge at a level appropriate to their age and provided opportunities for them to display leadership skills. There were many ways in which children could express themselves creatively through art.</p>
<p>The licensee and head teacher are working with staff to deepen their knowledge of the Reggio Emilia approach. The new daily routine has provided more opportunities for deeper and sustained learning and has led to greater mutual respect by children for their teachers and the centre environment. A new planning process assists teachers to identify children&rsquo;s next learning steps and ongoing project work. Children&rsquo;s portfolios provide a good summary of their learning experiences, are used as a literacy tool, and are shared with children and parents. A research project in M&#257;ori language and tikanga in 2012 has increased teacher awareness and use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p>
<p>The new head teacher is focussed on building the capability of teaching staff. Through processes of programme coordination, modelling and coaching she enables them to reflect on their teaching and children&rsquo;s learning, to plan effective learning projects, and to develop themselves as teacher researchers. This work is resulting in better learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>The centre has a clearly defined vision, mission, philosophy and teaching approach. Comprehensive systems are in place for self review through action research, and strategic and annual planning. There are opportunities for staff to be involved in these processes and there are strong links between strategic planning, self review, professional learning and staff appraisal. The centre owner and staff are strongly committed to ongoing improvement. The centre owner and head teacher have taken a proactive approach to the recent restructuring and have been sensitive to the possible impacts on staff, children, parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>The centre owner and teachers have developed strong relationships with parents and there are good examples of teachers keeping parents well informed of their child&rsquo;s progress on a daily basis. Parent expertise is used in areas of self review and in providing new learning experiences for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Centre leaders have identified and ERO agree that outcomes for children would be improved by:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing the curriculum to enrich the environment as the 'third teacher&rsquo;</li>
<li>developing bicultural understandings, particularly local histories and preferred ways of teaching and learning using aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>increasing links between children&rsquo;s learning, teacher planning and portfolios</li>
<li>fully implementing the new appraisal process</li>
<li>strengthening parent and wh&#257;nau partnerships.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Explorers Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
