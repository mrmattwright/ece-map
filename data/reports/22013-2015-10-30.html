</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiatarua Playcentre is a family cooperative and is licensed for 30 children, including 15 up to the age of two years. It operates in a Playcentre building in a native bush setting in the Waitakere Ranges. The Playcentre philosophy of whƒÅnau and children learning together guides centre operations. Centre whƒÅnau value the way that Playcentre promotes social opportunities for children and families.</p><p>The centre is part of Te Akoranga Playcentre Association, which provides Playcentre‚Äôs adult education programme, frameworks of policies and procedures, and support personnel. The centre‚Äôs representatives at¬†Association level support and guide the centre‚Äôs bicultural practices. Currently the national Playcentre organisation is in the process of a comprehensive restructure. This is likely to change the current structure of Te Akoranga Playcentre Association.</p><p>The centre offers three-hour, parent-led play sessions four days a week. The centre is used for adult education sessions attended by trainees from centres in the Association. The centre also hosts two SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children's Education) sessions for first time parents, run by the Association.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report centre members have made good progress in improving the quality of curriculum planning to focus on children‚Äôs individual interests.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five playcentre reviews in the Te Akoranga Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled, and benefit from having their parents with them at the centre. They are encouraged to explore and create independently, and are able to express themselves well. Younger children are developing confidence to interact with and trust adults other than their parents.</p><p>Adults provide children with choices in indoor play experiences and a sheltered area is used to offer a range of outdoor activities. Good consideration has been given to separating the active and quieter curriculum areas. Comfortable spaces are available for mothers needing to tend to their babies. Children see themselves at play in photograph displays. Notice boards reflect the centre‚Äôs commitment to a bicultural curriculum. Centre members agree that they could improve the environment by providing better storage for equipment and resources.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau work collaboratively to plan for children‚Äôs interests and learning needs. They also have strong links with the local community. Recently more experienced whƒÅnau have left the centre as their children go to school. Newer members are becoming more aware of learning programmes, policies, procedures and systems as they complete Playcentre training. Some are beginning to take on leadership roles. Responsibilities are clearly outlined and there is sound guidance and support from the Association. Paid Association workers give extra support during two sessions.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and the <em>Kei Tua o te Pae</em> assessment model. ‚ÄòChildren learning through play‚Äô is a major principle in the centre‚Äôs curriculum. Learning through exploration, creativity, construction, language, culture and the environment guides the curriculum. Association support is helping parents to extend children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>Recording children‚Äôs learning is being developed as parents increase their knowledge and skill through Playcentre training courses. They agree that they could strengthen the evaluation of children‚Äôs learning to ensure they provide a good quality curriculum for all children.</p><p>Emergent, shared and sustainable leadership is developing. Centre decisions are made through consensus. Through Association support, policies have been re-organised and a new concise self-review process has been introduced. Centre members should now embed these good management systems so they are understood by all members.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Association leaders and centre members agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>re-establishing sustainable management and leadership processes to guide the centre‚Äôs operations</li>
<li>developing a centre specific strategic plan that clearly documents strategic priorities and provides guidance for future centre members</li>
<li>continuing to build centre members‚Äô knowledge about Auckland‚Äôs diverse cultures and increase their capacity to respond to this diversity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiatarua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiatarua Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
