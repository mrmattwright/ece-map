</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Apples At-Home Childcare operates under the privately owned organisation of Apples Education. This newly established service provides homebased education and care for children up to five years of age in Auckland's North Shore and Rodney districts. Of the 80 children currently enrolled, approximately 75 percent children are Pākehā, six percent have Māori heritage, and 19 percent identify to other ethnicities.</p><p>After opening in 2016 the service was granted its full licence and then<strong> </strong>relicensed in 2017 due to significant growth. A second coordinator has recently been employed. The management team includes the owner, a manager, business manager and two coordinators. The managers and coordinators are fully registered teachers. The management team provides support and guidance for educators across the network.</p><p>This network is a standard funded service. A team of experienced educators provides programmes for up to four children at a time in their homes. The owner provides ongoing professional development for all educators to increase their qualification levels.</p><p>The service's vision has an emphasis on growing each child through connections to families, community and nature. The Apples At-Home Childcare philosophy is currently under review to ensure there is cohesiveness in practice across the service.<strong></strong></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service is community focused, and is fostering respectful, reciprocal relationships between the service, educators and families. Parents who spoke with ERO appreciate the good systems that are in place to regularly monitor the physical and emotional health and safety of their children. A belief in the value and benefits of home-based education and care for children and their whānau is evident.</p><p>Coordinators support children well to settle into educators' homes and to foster nurturing relationships with their educators. Documentation indicates that children learn in small mixed age groups, and build positive relationships with others. Coordinators make regular home visits to the educators and report on children's development.</p><p>Educators provide a range of learning opportunities for children in homes and in the community, including weekly playgroup meetings. Regular excursions into the community provide for broader learning opportunities for children to learn about the local environment. The management team has introduced a new planning framework to plan educators to guide children's learning experiences.</p><p>Children's learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Coordinators support educators to meet the needs and interests of each child, and to provide programmes that promote children’s curiosity and interests. The management team acknowledges the need to strengthen bicultural practices and ensure this commitment is included in the service's philosophy.</p><p>Managers work collaboratively to build consistent practices, and are committed to ongoing improvement. They have focused on building an effective team and using clear frameworks to guide educators. The owner provides generous provision of professional development for the management team. This has positively impacted on the increasingly good systems and processes used by the service.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning guides the service's future direction. The service has established internal reviews. However, these could be better aligned to the strategic plan and the evaluation process should be strengthened. A new teacher appraisal system is soon to be implemented. Governance policies and procedures are regularly reviewed. It is timely to ensure all policies and procedures reflect current practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management team agrees that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the extent to which programmes reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and children's languages and cultures</li>
<li>supporting educators to extend children's interests and development over time</li>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation by focusing on how well practices impact on outcomes for children</li>
<li>embedding an annual appraisal system that aligns to updated Educational Council requirements and reflects effective current teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Apples At-Home Childcare completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>Premises and facilities</li>
<li>Health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Apples At-Home Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>5 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
