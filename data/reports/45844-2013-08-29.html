</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Jervois Road provides all day education and care services for children between two and five years of age. Located in a heritage building, the centre consists of two rooms to cater for the different ages of children attending. The Tui room provides for children from two to three years and the Kiwi room for children from three years to school age. The programme of the centre is inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy, where parents, whƒÅnau, community and teachers play an integral part in all aspects of children‚Äôs learning, wellbeing and development.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre which opened at the beginning of 2012. The centre director is experienced in her role. The majority of teachers are qualified and one is training. They have varied cultural backgrounds. Most children that attend this centre are New Zealand European/PƒÅkehƒÅ.</p><p>The centre is part of the Lollipops Educare group of early childhood services. It operates under the comprehensive management systems that support all Lollipops Educare centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers work closely alongside children. Reciprocal relationships between teachers and children are warm and respectful. Effective teaching practices and meaningful conversations are used to develop and extend children‚Äôs thinking. Teachers have good knowledge of children as learners and provide an environment that encourages children‚Äôs play and exploration. There are good processes in place to support children as they come into the centre and as they leave to go to school. Teachers and parents work together to decide when younger children are ready to move into the older children‚Äôs room.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be active participants in their own learning. The programme for the older children allows them to play independently and in small groups. A local Kuia provides good modelling of te reo MƒÅori and promotes understanding of Te ƒÄo MƒÅori. Children enjoy participating in waiata. Teachers are keen to further strengthen bicultural practices in the curriculum.</p><p>Portfolios contain individual and group learning stories that show children‚Äôs strengths and interests. Teachers follow a clear format for learning stories and transitions between rooms are celebrated. Parents‚Äô contribute to their child‚Äôs learning and records of weekly activities for each room are clearly displayed. Wall displays show planning that has happened around children‚Äôs interests. The centre director has a good understanding of the community and relates well to parents.</p><p>Head office personnel provide high quality professional leadership. Professional learning opportunities for teachers is directed through appraisals and connected to strategic and annual goals. Teachers are developing self review as a tool to improve practice. The centre director effectively shares leadership within the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers, teachers and ERO agree that useful next steps for the centre include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen their understanding of biculturalism and how this can be embedded more effectively in practice</li>
<li>continuing to develop high quality resources for different ages of children</li>
<li>reviewing the quality of the learning programme for the younger children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Jervois Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Jervois Road will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>29 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
