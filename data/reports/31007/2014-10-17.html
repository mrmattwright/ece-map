</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pirongia Playcentre is a family based, parent-run cooperative service, located in the rural community of Pirongia, near Te Awamutu. The service operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA) and caters for children and families from birth to school age. The KCPA assists the centre by providing a framework for governance, including a comprehensive range of policies and administrative support.</p><p>The centre provides mixed-age sessions, open to all preschoolers and their chosen caregiver. Three general sessions run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and two supervised sessions for older children are held on Tuesday and Thursday.</p><p>The centre operates from a historic building believed to be the first school building constructed in the Pirongia area. Children and parents also make good use of the adjacent park, bike track and other local amenities. The outdoor area is spacious and affords many opportunities for active play and exploration. Since the last ERO review in 2011, the outdoor area has been extended to provide extra space, which is particularly useful during wet weather. In addition, a new administration room has been added, the library repositioned, and resources for younger children have been enhanced.</p><p>The centre aims to assist all children to grow up as ‚Äòcompetent and confident learners and communicators, healthy in mind, body and spirit, secure in their sense of belonging and in the knowledge that they make a valued contribution to society.‚Äô</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The co-presidents, assisted by KCPA personnel, are providing strong and knowledgeable leadership for the playcentre community. They are ably supported by office holders and other parent members. Highly effective leadership is contributing to strong partnerships among parents and shared understandings about centre philosophy, purpose and direction.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor learning environments enable children to explore and have prolonged access to high-quality resources and learning spaces. Children have extensive choice about their learning and about their levels of involvement with activities. They are able to follow and maintain an interest, and challenge themselves within a closely monitored environment. ERO observed children happily involved in exploring their environment, communicating with their parents and playing alongside their peers.</p><p>Leaders have high expectations for parents as first teachers and children as competent learners. Teaching strategies are focused on building children‚Äôs confidence as learners and capacity as decision makers. Parents notice opportunities to become involved and promote children‚Äôs learning and independence. Interactions are characterised by positive relationships and respect for children‚Äôs rights and dignity. The programme also promotes older children supporting younger children (tuakana-teina) and leadership opportunities for older children.</p><p>The playcentre programme is designed to meet the specific needs of children and the aspirations of parents. The programme is closely based on the strands and principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum, and all areas of play are evident in the environment and in children‚Äôs learning. The programme enables children to develop early literacy and mathematics skills and concepts as they explore their theories and ideas. Children also have many opportunities to develop their creativity and expression through art, music, drama, and role playing through a wide range of spontaneous play and investigation. Parents and children also go on excursions within the wider community that support children‚Äôs current interests and ideas.</p><p>Individual child portfolios and other displays around the centre make children‚Äôs learning visible. As a result of a recent review these documents are now more accessible to children and families to share and revisit learning. Assessment practices are well understood by senior members and are focused on noticing what children are doing, recognising the learning that is occurring, and responding by planning further experiences where appropriate. Centre leaders, with support from KCPA, recognise the need to continue to build members‚Äô capability and knowledge about current best practice in documenting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leadership within the centre is focused on providing high-quality early childhood education and care.</p><p>Centre leaders have put systems in place to support sustainability and continuation of direction and practice should parents move on from the centre. Effective self review, clarity of roles, ongoing parent education and a commitment to providing relevant professional development to increase members‚Äô individual and collective capabilities, also strengthen the sustainability of the centre.</p><p>The centre demonstrates a commitment to bicultural practice and is guided by one of the parents. Centre leaders acknowledge the need to continue to prioritise enhancing parents‚Äô capability to integrate MƒÅori perspectives throughout the programme, environment and interactions with children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pirongia Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pirongia Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 October 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
