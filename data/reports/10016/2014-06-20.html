</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The City Impact Church Care and Education service is located in Browns Bay. It is part of the City Impact Church educational campus. In 2013 managers merged two early childhood services on the campus under one licence. The centre’s programme incorporates <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the values and teachings of the City Impact Church.</p><p>The centre provides all-day education and care for infants, toddlers and preschool children for church families and the wider community. There are two learning areas. The first is for four year olds, and the second larger space, for children up to the age of three, also includes separate rooms.</p><p>The centre's management structure comprises an early childhood manager with oversight for centre leadership. The manager is supported by three head teachers who guide the work of the teaching team. The teaching team is very well qualified.</p><p>The managers and teachers have made some progress in addressing the areas for development identified in ERO’s reviews of the City Impact Church services. These areas included planned responsiveness to children’s interests and ideas, better access to resources, and improved performance and appraisal. ERO suggested staff strengthen their learning partnership with families and work to build cultural competence.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They are highly engaged in learning activities that involve cooperative and sustained play. An emphasis on verbal communication with teachers is resulting in articulate and confident children who mix well socially.</p><p>Teachers support sustained child-initiated play and facilitate children’s ideas, encouraging them to extend their own learning. Teachers could continue to progress their planning documentation to further strengthen its emphasis on the emerging interests of individual children and the centre's child-focused philosophy.</p><p>Learning environments are well designed and resourced. Educational materials and equipment are accessible for children. The outdoor environment has been extended to provide children with good physical challenge and choice. A spacious area is available for infants and toddlers. Teachers work closely with parents and are responsive to infants’ individual needs.</p><p>The centre has a multicultural roll and teaching staff. Good support is provided for children who speak a language other than English as their home language. Children who need additional support to learn are referred to appropriate agencies. Māori and Pacific children can see their cultural artefacts and languages reflected in the centre’s programmes and environments.</p><p>Since the2011 ERO review, teachers’ assessment practice has developed. Children’s learning portfolios include evidence about their learning progress over time, their interests and strengths, and their language development.</p><p>Teachers are supported with good professional learning opportunities, keeping them aware of recent educational theories and practice in early childhood teaching. Staff enjoy a collaborative and positive work environment. The management team supports teachers to maximise their learning time with children.</p><p>Managers and teachers are using effective self review as a tool for centre improvement. This practice could now be strengthened through a more strategic focus on learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that the next phase of centre development includes:</p><ul>
<li>planning an active learning partnership between the centre and families to further support children’s learning progress over time</li>
<li>teachers making more explicit use of the <em>Te Whāriki</em> strands to guide and evaluate the centre’s programme</li>
<li>supporting staff to build their capacity to deepen their inclusion of Māori perspectives in the curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of City Impact Church Care and Education completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of City Impact Church Care and Education will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
