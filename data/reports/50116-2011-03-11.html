<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2) is located in New Plymouth. This is the first education review since commencing operation in 2008. The centre caters for 30 children including up to 10 aged under two. Interactions and relationships are positive and supportive of children and their families. A review of centre philosophy is planned in 2011 to determine centre direction and align the views and aspirations of all education partners.</p><p>Staff changes, including a new supervisor, have resulted in an informal review of centre culture. Improved collaboration between staff is supporting educators&rsquo; consistency when responding to children&rsquo;s learning. Centre management agree professional learning and development should further develop educators&rsquo; ability to effectively and consistently respond to children&rsquo;s emerging needs.</p><p>Adults work collaboratively and encourage children to actively explore and engage in planned themes, independent and co-operative play. Assessment information is recorded in the form of group and individual learning stories. These are accessed by children to revisit their experiences and available for parents to make comment. Information is beginning to provide valuable prompts for educators to extend their learning conversations with children.</p><p>Children are suitably nurtured during transition times throughout the day. Individuals group together during planned meal times. Adults provide high levels of care and positive interactions throughout the day. Children are well supported to follow their interests and explore the well-resourced environment.</p><p>Some staff have participated in professional learning and development to extend their understanding and use of effective bicultural practice. Te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and karakia occur regularly throughout the day. Staff continue to build their knowledge and skills in this area, developing confidence when expressing words and phrases that acknowledge New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s dual heritage.</p><p>Positive relationships with families and wh&#257;nau are fostered by staff and between children. Parents and visitors are welcomed and their contributions valued. Children form meaningful bonds with adults and other children, contributing effectively to their emotional and social development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2).</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>This the first education review of Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2) since its opening in 2008. Changes to staffing in the previous twelve months, including the appointment of a new supervisor, have formed a new team that emphasises collaboration between staff. The supervisor and licensee acknowledge that centre development is focused on providing all staff with opportunities to participate in professional learning and development (PLD) and improve the consistency of educators&rsquo; response to children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Programme</h5><p>Children&rsquo;s ideas and interests are increasingly responded to through planned and spontaneous learning experiences. Educators work collaboratively to encourage and motivate active participation in activities. Many children sustain their involvement is specific aspects of play for extended periods of time. They are increasingly confident in taking turns, sharing, making requests and playing alongside others. Assessment portfolios and daily planning are accessible to children and parents for them to offer contributions and revisit learning. Information is beginning to be used to make decisions that extend children&rsquo;s learning opportunities.</p><h5>Learning environment</h5><p>A purposeful environment supports children&rsquo;s interests. Resources and activities are designed to enhance learning and promote physical and social development. Access to puzzles and manipulative resources assist with problem solving and imaginative play. Children enthusiastically participate in a valuable range of activities that meets their emerging interests.</p><h5>Interactions and relationships</h5><p>Warm, responsive relationships encourage children to actively pursue their interests. Educators work alongside children to motivate exploration. They demonstrate curiosity, problem solve and theorise about their experiences. Cooperative play supports social development. Staff work collegially with the supervisor to develop their practice. Children experience an environment where adults are positive role models and respectful, caring relationships occur.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Responding to learning</h5><p>ERO identifies and centre management agrees that some staff require further development to effectively notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning. Whole centre PLD is planned to increase educators&rsquo; skill and knowledge. Improved understanding of teaching and learning based on current theory should further develop capability and benefit children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h5>Philosophy review</h5><p>Centre management identifies that a planned review of centre philosophy is required to revisit the collective expectations and aspirations of families. Establishing a shared philosophy should contribute to improving the robustness of strategic planning. Setting clear goals for future development aligned to indicators for expected outcomes should provide a context for self review and promote sustainability of practice.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>Currently the centre has two M&#257;ori children enrolled. Some staff have participated in PLD focused on developing and including te reo M&#257;ori in centre practice. A review of philosophy is planned and will include the aspirations for M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Transition</h5><p>Transition is well managed. Processes are flexible and supportive of children and parents through information sharing. Orientation by staff provides a welcoming experience for parents and wh&#257;nau. Children&rsquo;s cultural heritage is acknowledged and promoted in all aspects of centre practice.</p><h5>Relationships with wh&#257;nau</h5><p>Staff engage with parents and wh&#257;nau to discuss children&rsquo;s daily experiences. Portfolios are used to document and share learning and include opportunities for parents to contribute. The learning environment, including the use of te r&#275;o M&#257;ori language, reflects a commitment to inclusive bicultural practices.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Philosophy review</h5><p>As part of the planned philosophy review centre managers should identify and include the aspirations M&#257;ori parents have for their children. Collected information should contribute to centre direction and provide valuable information for strategic planning and regular self review. Meaningfully engaging parents and wh&#257;nau supports positive outcomes for M&#257;ori children.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2) completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><ol>
<li>participation in professional learning and development should continue to improve educators ability to effectively respond to children&rsquo;s learning, and</li>
<li>a review of the centre philosophy should contribute to an agreed direction, inform strategic planning and better support planned self review.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-wrinkles-early-learning-centre-centre-2" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2)</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2).</p><p>Wrinkles Early Learning Centre (Centre 2) is located in New Plymouth. This is the first education review since commencing operation in 2008. The centre caters for 30 children including up to 10 aged under two. Interactions and relationships are positive and supportive of children and their families. A review of centre philosophy is planned in 2011 to determine centre direction and align the views and aspirations of all education partners.</p><p>Staff changes, including a new supervisor, have resulted in an informal review of centre culture. Improved collaboration between staff is supporting educators&rsquo; consistency when responding to children&rsquo;s learning. Centre management agree professional learning and development should further develop educators&rsquo; ability to effectively and consistently respond to children&rsquo;s emerging needs.</p><p>Adults work collaboratively and encourage children to actively explore and engage in planned themes, independent and co-operative play. Assessment information is recorded in the form of group and individual learning stories. These are accessed by children to revisit their experiences and available for parents to make comment. Information is beginning to provide valuable prompts for educators to extend their learning conversations with children.</p><p>Children are suitably nurtured during transition times throughout the day. Individuals group together during planned meal times. Adults provide high levels of care and positive interactions throughout the day. Children are well supported to follow their interests and explore the well-resourced environment.</p><p>Some staff have participated in professional learning and development to extend their understanding and use of effective bicultural practice. Te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and karakia occur regularly throughout the day. Staff continue to build their knowledge and skills in this area, developing confidence when expressing words and phrases that acknowledge New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s dual heritage.</p><p>Positive relationships with families and wh&#257;nau are fostered by staff and between children. Parents and visitors are welcomed and their contributions valued. Children form meaningful bonds with adults and other children, contributing effectively to their emotional and social development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
