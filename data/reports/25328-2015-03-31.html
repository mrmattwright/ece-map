</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park Herne Bay Early Childhood Education Centre is a privately owned franchise that operates with the support of Bear Park Franchise Systems Limited. The Bear Park management group provides systems, policies, support and guidance to ensure consistent franchise practices. The new owner works collaboratively with centre supervisors and Bear Park support personnel to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The centre provides good quality education and care for children from three months to five years of age. The centre is licensed for 75 children who are representative of the predominantly New Zealand European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, and Chinese communities. A small number of children from a small range of additional ethnicities also attend.</p><p>Children interact in age-related groups in four separate rooms and two shared playgrounds. While all teachers have some leadership roles within each of the rooms, two supervisors oversee the management of programmes.</p><p>The Bear Park philosophy links <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and aspects of Reggio Emilia learning approaches to guide teachers‚Äô thinking about education and care for children. The centre‚Äôs vision is focused on positive outcomes for children and developing partnerships between families and teachers.</p><p>The service was previously comprised of two centres: a centre for infants and toddlers and a centre for preschoolers. In 2013 it was relicensed as one centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the attractive and well resourced centre. Staff greet children with enthusiasm and support them to settle into the programme. Children talk freely with teachers and other children, sharing their thinking and ideas about their interests.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are relaxed and confidently initiate interactions with adults. Respectful conversations promote children‚Äôs confidence, self esteem and trust in teachers. The programme supports their general development, emotional wellbeing and emerging language.</p><p>Teachers have developed partnerships with families. They gather information from parents about their children‚Äôs interests and backgrounds. Teachers know about each child and keep each other updated about children‚Äôs interests within centre and at home. A parent group meets regularly to contribute to the centre planning.</p><p>Staff manage children‚Äôs transition into the centre in carefully considered ways. Children‚Äôs transitions to school are also well supported. Literacy, mathematics and natural science are woven through programmes. Children‚Äôs social competence and independence is promoted. There are frequent opportunities for parents to learn about the values and learning intentions held by teachers.</p><p>The influence of Reggio Emilia approaches to learning are clearly evident in the purposeful environment, which is focused on sustainable living and recycling. The learning environment invites children‚Äôs exploration and discoveries. Local excursions and subsequent discussions help children to investigate their community and the wider world.</p><p>The programme achieves respectful learning partnerships between parents, children and teachers. Information communication technologies (ICT) are used to promote regular conversations between teachers and parents about children‚Äôs learning experiences and progress. Teachers and parents maintain very good documentation about learning in children‚Äôs ‚Äòabout me‚Äô books, daily diaries and portfolios journals.</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on supporting children‚Äôs development as individual thinkers and learners, and on encouraging them to learn how to participate in small group discussions. Children‚Äôs learning dispositions are recognised and are well supported.</p><p>Although few MƒÅori children attend the centre, teachers recognise the importance of all children learning about New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. Professional development is enabling teachers to build their use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. Staff plan to further enhance bicultural practice by researching the local history of tangata whenua /iwi.</p><p>Management practices are efficient and effective. The Bear Park franchise systems, frameworks and policies are well developed and regularly reviewed. Teachers receive regular professional learning and guidance to help them to review and develop teaching practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the centre include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the focus on understanding MƒÅori culture, identity and language</li>
<li>explore ways to promote and affirm child-initiated play to further enrich learning opportunities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park Herne Bay Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span>Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park Herne Bay Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>31 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
