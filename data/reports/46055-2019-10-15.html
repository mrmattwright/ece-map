</table><p>Fundamentals Merivale¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fundamentals Merivale is one of two early learning services owned and operated by a family business in Christchurch. Fundamentals Marshlands is the other centre.</p><p>Fundamentals Merivale caters for the education and care of children from birth to school age. It is located in a re-purposed villa. There are three designated areas for children aged 0 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and 3 to 5 years. There is also an internal gymnasium.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO report there have been significant changes to the ownership, leadership, administration and operation of the service. All of the teachers, including the owner, are either qualified and registered or involved in training.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have established a shared vision and philosophy. The vision states ‚Äòour children enjoy a challenging and fun environment that encourages them to think, act and succeed in mind, body and spirit so they can become confident, independent, life-long learners'. The philosophy emphasises active movement, love of learning, respect, fun, and collaboration for children.</p><p>This review was one of two education and care reviews in the Fundamentals ECE Ltd service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers foster genuine, caring relationships with children and families. These underpin the curriculum and strategic direction of the service to promote positive outcomes for tamariki, whƒÅnau and teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy and practices are inclusive and respectful of families. Emphasis is given to the development of emerging leadership and the empowerment of children and teachers. Relational leadership focuses on building leadership capacity and teacher capability.</p><p>The child-centred curriculum, and well written learning records, reflect the priorities for children's learning. This includes promoting children's social competencies, sense of belonging, confidence to explore, physical challenges and fun learning experiences. Teachers are purposeful in the ways they extend children‚Äôs oral language and science-related learning.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to observe, assess and extend children‚Äôs emerging interests, strengths and capabilities. Children with additional learning needs are well supported to succeed in their learning. Teachers advocate for the needs of diverse learners and work collaboratively to build trusting professional relationships with families and external agencies.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing and caring interactions that are responsive to their individual needs and preferences. Teachers work effectively together to ensure the wellbeing of children. Unhurried and calm teacher practices promote a sense of belonging. Parent aspirations are valued and well used to inform planning for individual children.</p><p>The owner and centre manager have high expectations and a systematic approach to the management and operation of the service. There is a deliberate focus on building leadership capacity, teacher capability and a collaborative team culture. Targeted external and internal professional development and individual support and mentoring are aligned to service priorities. A strong appraisal process and measured approach to inquiry and internal evaluation are developing teachers' understanding of reflective and evaluative practices. Leaders value and make good use of the strengths and skills of the teaching team to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>give prominence to bicultural perspectives and te ao MƒÅori practices in key centre documentation and practices</li>
<li>further develop and embed new initiatives around assessment, planning and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and service leaders agree that refining the strategic plan, to clearly identify key annual priorities and actions, would enable them to effectively monitor, evaluate and report on the progress of these strategic goals.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fundamentals Merivale completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the on-site stage of the review ERO identified a number of non-compliances. These included potential hazards in relation to safety in the event of an earthquake and the safe use of heaters. Service leaders acted promptly to provide ERO with evidence that these non-compliances have been addressed.</p><p>While hazard identification and management processes have been improved, the centre must ensure that robust processes for identifying and managing hazards are sustained. The manager should receive ongoing assurance that all health and safety requirements are being met.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>15 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
