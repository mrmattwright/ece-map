</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Karaka Learning 4 is one of two privately owned licensed centres which operate from within the Karaka Learning Service complex. The service provides full-day care and education for up to 140 children over two years of age. Children are generally grouped according to age.</p><p>Centres 4, 5 and 6 operate under the Karaka Learning Centre 4 licence. Centres 4 and 6 each cater for 50 children from three to five years of age. Children aged from two to three years attend Centre 5. Each centre has a separate outdoor play area and access to an on-site heated swimming pool in the summer months.</p><p>The vision for the centre is expressed as 'Learn to Love to Learn'. The philosophy is under review at present. Parents are able to contribute to this process online.</p><p>The centre is managed and led by a team of teachers and staff. Supervisors lead their individual teams, and a manager and safety officer take overall responsibility for day-to-day operations. Curriculum development is a shared responsibility.</p><p>The 2016 ERO review noted the beginnings of bicultural practice, improvements in recording children's learning, and effective transitions through the centres. Relationships with children and families were positive and friendly, and management was efficient. These aspects have been maintained.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report highlighted the need for learning programmes to be more closely aligned with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, for teacher appraisal processes to include cultural competency expectations, and for the annual plan to detail how the goals from the strategic plan could be achieved. These aspects continue to require further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Karaka Learning Centre service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed at the start of the day. Children settle well in the early morning session, with positive encouragement from teachers. They select from the resources and pre-set activities provided, and engage quickly in play. Generous numbers of staff enable teachers to have friendly and informative conversations with whƒÅnau about their children.</p><p>Transitions through the centres are planned and unhurried. Children with diverse needs are carefully included in programmes and well supported by additional staff, specifically employed for this purpose.</p><p>During set times, children engage in play outdoors, demonstrating friendships and collaboration with others. They are carefully supervised and chat freely with teachers. Teachers should consider ways of engaging children in more direct conversations about their play at such times, using open-ended questioning and problem-solving prompts to encourage deep and extended play.</p><p>The first part of the day features teacher-led group and individual learning times. These focus on learning skills in reading, writing and mathematics but do not clearly reflect the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and its focus on learning through play.</p><p>Teachers keep parents well informed about children's participation and progress over time using an on-line platform. Some parents also use this portal to share photographs and brief accounts of children's home life. These entries add to teachers' information about the children in their care. Parents speak well of the support teachers provide, and of the warmth and welcome they receive from staff.</p><p>Teachers collaboratively plan programmes each month. Plans focus on activities linked to an interest or theme. Teachers should make better use of children's individual interests and strengths to inform planning decisions. They should also evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching strategies in extending individual children's learning through play.</p><p>Teachers have made progress in reflecting the bicultural emphasis of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. A staff member has helped to strengthen teachers' confidence and engagement with both te reo and tikanga MƒÅori within the programme. Teachers are now well poised to continue their bicultural journey with children. This should include a stronger focus on supporting MƒÅori children's success as MƒÅori.</p><p>Policies and procedures, and other aspects of management are fully documented, sometimes overly so. The appraisal processes are under review at present, and health and safety requirements are rigorously implemented and well monitored.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders should streamline policies and procedures to reduce over-documentation and support teachers to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop learning programmes that more closely align with the expectations of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> regarding play-based, child-led programme planning that responds to children's interests and strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage children in conversations that promote thinking and problem-solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen staff involvement in internal evaluation that focuses more strongly on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop bicultural practices in the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>It is timely for management to seek professional support to build leadership capability and develop an action plan that supports teachers to implement <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> expectations. This plan should set service-wide goals that are included in strategic and annual plans and in appraisal processes.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Karaka Learning Centre 4 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Karaka Learning Centre 4 will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>9 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
