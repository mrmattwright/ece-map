</table><p>Wee Wisdom Montessori Weymouth Tuakana¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wee Wisdom Montessori Weymouth Tuakana operates as one of two adjacent centres under the Wee Wisdom management organisation. Teina, for younger children, caters for children up to the age of three years, and Tuakana for 40 children over two years of age. The centre provides full-day education and care and caters for a diverse community, with some whƒÅnau travelling distances to bring their children to the centre.</p><p>The philosophy is based around the teachings of Maria Montessori and also includes <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers bring a variety of qualifications and experience in both Montessori teaching and mainstream practice. The service aims, through the Montessori approach, to work in partnership with family, whƒÅnau and the community to nurture children to become competent, confident learners who are prepared for life.</p><p>The centres are privately owned, and a general manager for Wee Wisdom Group provides ongoing, regular support for teachers. The general manager has embedded online systems to streamline planning and administration tasks. This is establishing shared practice across the organisation. At present the centre has a support gap in staffing.</p><p>Tuakana has recently had staff vacancies, and the two centres are facing staffing issues. Relievers have been employed to fill positions, and all relevant opportunities have been taken to recruit new staff, including a manager, to oversee both centres. This situation is causing disruption and challenges, particularly in Tuakana.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted a calm, settled atmosphere in the centre, with teachers focusing on building relationships with whƒÅnau. Children were settled and had a sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers were monitoring children's development and informing parents through learning stories. Teamwork was established and teachers appreciated external advice and support.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed, and the majority of children settle quickly to self-chosen activities. The atmosphere of inclusion, valuing of children and openness with whƒÅnau is highly evident and reflects the philosophy of the centre.</p><p>Children engage well while teachers support children's work with Montessori materials and resources. Some children are finding it difficult to settle to play early in the day. Teachers talk positively with children. They encourage children's engagement with outdoor environment and equipment at any time. Children support each other and show good examples of tuakana/teina relationships in action. While teachers' conversations with children are pleasant, they do not often provoke deeper discussion and sharing of ideas.</p><p>The indoor environment is attractive and spacious. Teachers use the walls to display important messages for parents, as well as tentative planning and examples of children's work. A number of reading and play resources are labelled in a variety of languages familiar to children. Children have easy access to appropriate mathematical resources and prompts for understanding scientific and natural elements. The programme in action did not demonstrate a planned approach.</p><p>The staffing issues faced by the service have significantly impacted on the level of staffing in Tuakana. The centre no longer has a head teacher. The lack of leadership in the previous few months has led to a lessening of capability within the team to effectively manage day-to-day operations, assessment and teamwork. This issue must remain a priority for management.</p><p>The general manager's support for staff to confidently write effective learning stories has not been retained. Teachers contribute group stories to the online portal that parents are able to access. These stories do not adequately inform parents of children's progress or the effectiveness of teaching. Planning has been slow to be re-established after the Christmas break. The general manager monitors the quality of all learning stories on the portal, and is aware of the lack of leadership to address these issues.</p><p>WhƒÅnau are invited to attend whƒÅnau/teacher meetings during the year to discuss their child's progress and contribute their aspirations for their child's learning. Teachers provide a report of children's progress and what they know of their dispositions for learning.</p><p>Teachers respond well to children with diverse needs. Children benefit from the close attention of teachers when they are learning new Montessori skills and attributes. Transitions into and through the centre, and to school, are well managed.</p><p>Teachers are building their capacity to use te reo MƒÅori, and to use tikanga practices around food times. Children demonstrate familiarity with waiata, karakia and simple commands. This is a good beginning to establishing bicultural practices.</p><p>Collaborative internal evaluation, both planned and spontaneous, is used to review the effectiveness of strategic and annual plans, and appraisal goals. Use of the online portal is encouraging teachers to share their thinking and ideas more freely. This is beginning to be effective as teachers start to embed this new knowledge. The manager is also undertaking a thorough policy review, and has established a new appraisal process that includes current expectations of the Teaching Council. These new initiatives are making a positive difference for teachers and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified key next steps for management and teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that teachers embed high quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enriching conversations with children to prompt their responses, thinking and sharing of ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responding more effectively to children's interests and strengths, and planning to extend and challenge children's thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging in more systematic and regular reflection and evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching practices using both <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and Montessori resources to make judgements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening teacher confidence with bicultural practices and strengthening leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing strategies to address staffing challenges.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wee Wisdom Montessori Weymouth Tuakana completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation.<br><em>(Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008, 6 C2)</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>30 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
