</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Northland Community Pre-School is licensed to provide early childhood education for a maximum of 30 children, including 10 children up to two years old. It is a not-for-profit centre managed by a parent-elected committee. The centre has a stable roll and a small waiting list.</p><p>In February 2013, as a result of significant fundraising and community support, the centre moved from the Northland Community Hall to its own premises in Wilton. In the past year, there have been many significant changes, including new premises, community and personnel. The leader is managing the changes well through collaborative leadership and use of self review.</p><p>The centre has responded to recommendations made in the May 2011 ERO report. The new team of teachers and managers is currently reviewing the philosophy to ensure it matches the new community‚Äôs goals, beliefs and aspirations. All teachers are qualified and registered. Building strong reciprocal relationships with families and whƒÅnau is an important part of the centre‚Äôs philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is evident in practice. Children participate enthusiastically in a curriculum that is based on their interests and ideas. Their wellbeing, sense of belonging and opportunities to contribute, communicate and explore are well supported. Routines are flexible and responsive to children‚Äôs needs.</p><p>Children are settled and engaged in their learning. Teachers use a range of teaching strategies to engage children in learning and extend thinking and encourage problem-solving. Teachers are developing a bicultural curriculum and children frequently hear te reo MƒÅori. Children‚Äôs early literacy and mathematical concepts are fostered within the context of their play. Children with diverse learning needs contribute within an inclusive environment.</p><p>Information gained from individual and group assessment is used to guide the centre‚Äôs programmes. Teachers are highly attuned to children's needs. Staff recognise and respond to opportunities to extend children‚Äôs learning and observations are analysed and used for planning. Children‚Äôs individual progress is evident throughout their learning stories.</p><p>Older children support younger children through tuakana teina relationships in a mixed-age group setting. Children‚Äôs independence is fostered. They are empowered to take increased responsibility for their own wellbeing and that of others.</p><p>Children up to two years old have key teachers who know them well. Children are developing language through appropriate activities and use of resources. They are becoming confident communicators and explorers.</p><p>Children have a spacious, purpose-modified environment that supports free play and offers challenge to younger and older children. The new environment invites children to explore and become fully involved in a wide variety of activities that are meaningful and enjoyable for them.</p><p>Managers and teachers work collaboratively to use self review. Information from a range of sources is analysed and used for future planning. Self-review processes enable the team to develop and make changes together. The centre‚Äôs community is invited to participate in review processes.</p><p>The head teacher guides teachers effectively, with a focus on team building. Teachers work collegially, taking responsibility for those areas in which they show strength. Teachers are encouraged to reflect critically on their practice. They are provided with professional development that supports improved teaching practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>Parents‚Äô participation in their children‚Äôs learning is valued and encouraged. Parents contribute to their children‚Äôs learning portfolios. Transitions to school are supported through effective partnerships between families, the preschool and schools, with plans for ongoing development of these processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There have been many recent, significant changes at Northland Community Pre-School in premises, community and personnel. The centre‚Äôs managers agree with ERO‚Äôs external evaluation that they should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>revisit the philosophy statement and guiding documents to align with the current community beliefs, goals and aspirations</li>
<li>develop bicultural practices and promote success for Maori children as MƒÅori, through ongoing development in understanding <em>Ka Hikitia ‚Äì Accelerating Success 2013‚Äì2017</em></li>
<li>implement the appraisal process for the new leader and teachers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Northland Community Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Northland Community Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>24 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
