</table><p>Kids Forever Christian Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Forever Christian Preschool provides early childhood education and care for up to 39 children from two years of age.</p><p>The preschool operates as part of the Mount Albert Baptist Community Trust Board. The service is governed by a committee which includes church representatives and the centre manager. The centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre. She leads a team of four qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre's Christian based philosophy states that the multicultural preschool aims to provide excellent care and education, where children are included and valued in a nurturing environment where "God's love" is demonstrated.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted the passion and commitment teachers bring to their role in supporting children's learning. Teachers create an inviting environment that attracts children and provides prompts for exploration. These aspects have been maintained. Since that review, teachers have continued to enhance their teaching by building culturally responsive practices, and further refining internal evaluation processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently make choices and follow their interests. Teachers offer a wide variety of activities and experiences in well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas. Children move freely between learning spaces and have many opportunities to develop their imaginative play and creativity. They establish respectful friendships with teachers and their peers. Interactions between teachers and children are positive and contribute to children's learning.</p><p>Children contribute to the group learning programme. They discuss the learning focus with teachers. Teachers ensure that children's ideas are heard. Teachers offer experiences for children's exploration and foster their learning through play.</p><p>Children are focused and eager to participate in the programme. Teachers promote children's knowledge, learning and interests. They engage children in meaningful conversations. Teachers are sensitive and responsive to children‚Äôs individual development.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs Christian-based philosophy is strongly evident in the programme. Children practise the Christian values that are integrated into the daily programme. Bible stories have a special daily emphasis. Parents value the strong aroha that fosters a sense of belonging in the centre. Parents acknowledge how the Christian values are reflected in their children's social development.</p><p>Parents express a very high level of satisfaction with the care provided for their children. They appreciate the personalised support. Parents value the opportunities to discuss their child‚Äôs learning reported in individualised portfolios and during informal parent-teacher meetings.</p><p>Teachers promote bicultural practice well. The integration of MƒÅori language is strongly evident in the programme. Children have opportunities to hear and speak te reo MƒÅori. The bicultural heritage of Aotearoa is celebrated throughout the preschool environment.</p><p>Children's home languages and cultures are recognised and honoured. Teachers are responsive to the rich diversity of cultures, including children of Pacific heritage, in the preschool. Parents are encouraged to share their cultural practices and languages.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively as a team to provide learning programmes. They regularly document children's learning goals and group child-led play. Managers support teachers well with professional development opportunities. This support has helped teachers to contribute to the priorities for the preschool and ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment, planning, and evaluation processes to make learning and teaching more visible for individual children and groups of children, with an emphasis on planning for learning dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing teacher appraisal processes and practices to meet the Teaching Council requirements and to build teacher capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by including the use of evaluative questions and analysing effectiveness in terms of outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Forever Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>6 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
