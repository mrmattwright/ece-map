</table><p>Kaiapoi Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaiapoi Preschool is open five days per week for full-day sessions. The centre was acquired in 2017 by the new owner who is also the centre manager. It is licensed for 23 children aged two years to school age.</p><p>There have been a number of changes in teaching staff since the 2016 ERO review. Most teachers are fully qualified early childhood educators. The centre‚Äôs learning community includes children with diverse needs. The centre is supported by an independent parent committee.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy, underpinned by Te WhƒÅriki (2017), the Early Childhood Curriculum, states that they provide ‚Äòa warm and nurturing environment, where tamariki develop a happy, healthy and secure approach to living and learning‚Äô.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to explore and develop their learning. They have access to a wide range of activities and resources to extend their interests and ideas. Children benefit from purposeful interactions with teachers who help them question and investigate concepts and their ideas.</p><p>Teachers respond well to the learning needs of children, demonstrating a flexible approach in their thinking and strategies that recognise and value children‚Äôs learning. Children who identify as MƒÅori are supported by teachers through a considered and consultative strengths-based approach.</p><p>Teachers provide a broad range of curriculum experiences to meet the service‚Äôs intended outcomes for children‚Äôs learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>making science concepts visible to foster children‚Äôs understanding of the natural world</li>
<li>prioritising those language and communication skills that assist children in articulating their thoughts and ideas</li>
<li>using curriculum planning to specifically focus on learning outcomes in areas such as music and mathematics.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers demonstrate an in-depth understanding of each child as a learner through informative individual assessment and planning. They deliberately design and evaluate the effectiveness of teaching strategies to support children's learning. The centre regularly shares assessment activities with parents and seeks their input into planning and curriculum delivery. Teachers‚Äô knowledge about children‚Äôs learning progress needs to be more consistently visible in learning documentation.</p><p>Concepts of te ao MƒÅori are valued and woven through the curriculum. They include connections with the local marae, and research and practical skill building to extend teacher capability and capacity.</p><p>Teachers engage in collaborative, professional dialogue to review and improve the centre‚Äôs practices. Regular team discussions support reflective practice to inform decision making and improvements to teaching and learning for children. Internal evaluation processes now need to be strengthened to more clearly show how well the centre is achieving its intended outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre has a capable leadership and management team who work effectively together to promote and model collaborative practice that is child focussed. They capitalise on team strengths and actively support leadership opportunities for staff. Leadership and management are successfully implementing effective systems to support the new teaching team and the operation of the service, including teacher appraisal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs effectiveness in achieving its intended outcomes for children‚Äôs learning needs to be more visible in the deliberateness of planning, assessment and internal evaluation documentation.</p><p>The new team has created documentation to support systems and processes. The centre should now strengthen its foundational documents, including alignment between strategic planning, annual planning and the philosophy statement, to support ongoing improvement.</p><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that a cultural narrative of the local environment and its history needs to be developed to continue to enhance bicultural practices and further strengthen the sense of belonging for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaiapoi Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>11 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
