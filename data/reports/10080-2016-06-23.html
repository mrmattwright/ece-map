</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nukutukulea Aoga Niue is a Pacific early childhood centre that successfully promotes Niue language culture and identity. The centre has separate indoor areas for children under two years and over two years of age. Since the 2013 ERO review, children from the separate areas have more opportunities to play together in the centre's spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>A professional support manager effectively supports the centre manager and teachers to implement internal evaluation processes with the focus on improving outcomes for children. Staff have used ERO's findings to extend children's learning and support children's self-help capabilities.</p><p>Governance and management has strengthened over the last three years. The Pasifika ECE Alliance, a community early childhood education service, helps the centre keep up-to-date and compliant with legislative requirements.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and capable learners. They choose from a variety of areas of play that extend their learning. Children communicate well with each other and adults using ko e vagahau Niuƒì. They have many opportunities to connect with each other and learn through their culture.</p><p>Trusting relationships between adults, and between adults and children contribute to good quality learning interactions. Children enjoy a strong sense of belonging. They are confident and cooperate well to support each other‚Äôs play.</p><p>Provision for children less than two years of age is well considered and nurturing. Children explore and learn in a spacious and stimulating learning environment. Teachers interact with infants and toddlers in a calm, unhurried way. They are sensitive to children‚Äôs preferences and requirements.</p><p>Well considered programme planning responds to children‚Äôs interests. Planning and assessment is closely aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and informed by current early childhood education theories. Te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori is incorporated and celebrated within the programme.</p><p>There are some good examples of teachers extending children‚Äôs thinking. These models of sustained, extended play could provide a basis for developing greater consistency of good quality teaching and learning practices as the centre programme is further developed.</p><p>Children‚Äôs transitions to, and within the centre are well managed. As a result of the centre promoting successful partnerships with local schools, transitions of older children from the centre have been enhanced.</p><p>Practical steps are being taken by centre leaders and teachers to involve parents more in learning partnerships. The centre's parent group actively supports teachers by providing effective communication between the centre and home. Children's assessment portfolios reflect the centre's drive to include more parent voice in their children's learning.</p><p>Teachers actively support children‚Äôs wellbeing. Healthy eating and physical activity is effectively promoted in the centre. Children have opportunities to understand the importance of healthy food and are aware of the benefit of leading active lives. Teachers and parents report that children influence healthy choices being made at home.</p><p>Effective leadership and management impact positively on ongoing improvement. Internal evaluation has positively influenced centre practices. Teachers are more aware of ways they can support children as capable learners. They have successfully implemented some good teaching practices to enhance children's learning in literacy and mathematics.</p><p>Very good support from Pasifika ECE Alliance ensures that centre operations serve children and their families well. The organisation's Professional Services Manager provides effective support to centre leaders and teachers. Increasingly, staff are reflective in their practice and show leadership in contributing to the centre's continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers discussed the following key next steps in this centre‚Äôs ongoing improvement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining ways that teachers are supported in order to meet their particular professional development requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build on current, effective internal evaluation processes by reviewing the impact of programmes and teaching practices on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO is confident that the centre has the capacity and capability through its good quality leadership and effective long-term planning to sustain its development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nukutukulea Aoga Niue Incorp. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nukutukulea Aoga Niue Incorp. will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
