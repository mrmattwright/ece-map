<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton is located in the New Brighton suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates on a full day basis for six hours a day to provide care and education for 40 children over the age of two.</p><p>South Brighton is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides clear policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety, regular professional development support and opportunities for teachers. All teachers are fully qualified and registered as early childhood teachers.</p><p>Teachers work well together and provide a range of learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>inclusive and affirming relationships between children and teachers</li>
<li>attractive and well-resourced indoor and outdoor play areas</li>
<li>the way teachers effectively respond to children&rsquo;s interests and abilities</li>
<li>partnerships between home and the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p>The next step is for teachers to strengthen assessment and self-review processes.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton.</p><ul>
<li>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</li>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and teachers.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Kidsfirst Kindergarten - South Brighton has a philosophy that encourages children to contribute to their own learning. Teachers have high expectations for children, and provide a wide range of experiences to support children&rsquo;s curiosity and problem-solving skills. The kindergarten reflects and celebrates the cultural diversity of families and community. Partnerships between home and the kindergarten are valued.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Relationships</h4><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They benefit from respectful and caring relationships. Teachers know the children and their families well, and use effective practices and routines to encourage and extend children&rsquo;s thinking. This helps children to develop curiosity, and willingness to take learning risks. Teachers and parents model positive relationships and are effective in supporting children&rsquo;s choices and responsibilities. Children play well together, sharing ideas and helping each other.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p>Children learn and play in an attractive well-resourced environment. The indoor area has a range of resources that encourage children to choose and participate in a wide variety of play activities. There is a good balance of indoor, outdoor and natural areas for children to explore. The outdoor area reflects the community values of sustainability and enjoying the outdoors. All areas are easy for children to access and provide opportunities for them to be challenged.</p><p>The kindergarten supports parents to feel comfortable, and to stay on and be involved in their children&rsquo;s care and learning. New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage is reflected in the environment through te reo prompts, natural materials, and kowhaiwhai patterns. Teachers and children enjoy waiata at mat time.</p><h4>Programme planning</h4><p>Teachers notice and respond effectively to children&rsquo;s developing interests and abilities. Monthly planning meetings make good use of teachers&rsquo; evaluation of their practices to bring positive changes for learning. The kindergarten&rsquo;s planning is well displayed to inform parents and invite their contribution.</p><p>Recent programme focuses on literacy and children&rsquo;s cultures have effectively engaged children and developed their learning interests and abilities. Children&rsquo;s profile books have regular entries about children&rsquo;s progress and achievements. They are well written, attractively presented and easily accessible for children and families. Teachers provide useful analysis of children&rsquo;s learning in the profiles.</p><h4>Team culture</h4><p>Teachers work well together to provide good quality care for children. They regularly reflect and review how they can improve practices which includes effective consultation and communication with families. The head teacher is an effective leader who is aware of and uses individual and team strengths to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Strengthening assessment</h4><p>Teachers&rsquo; analysis of learning in individual children&rsquo;s profiles is useful. However it is not always clear what children&rsquo;s next steps for learning are. Teachers should further develop the links between learning stories to show how individual children&rsquo;s learning is progressing.</p><h4>Self-review</h4><p>It is not always clear how self-review information is used to plan for the kindergarten&rsquo;s improvements. The next step is to further develop ways to use the findings of self review to make specific changes for improvement.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic.</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>The kindergarten has developed useful processes for the enrolment and inclusion of children with moderate or severe special needs. Teachers regularly consult and communicate with support agencies. These agencies provide useful information, expertise and training for teachers to improve outcomes for children with special needs.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises inclusive practices. Teachers value the partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau, and recognise the differing learning styles, strengths and interests of children. This has helped them to develop useful transition processes including:</p><ul>
<li>the exchange of information prior to enrolment</li>
<li>consultation with support agencies and families to develop individual education plans, and the use of education support workers to assist children with special needs</li>
<li>support for other parents and children at the kindergarten</li>
<li>regular monitoring of children&rsquo;s learning and well-being.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton completed an ERO and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>17 February 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-south-brighton" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens - South Brighton is located in the New Brighton suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates on a full day basis for six hours a day to provide care and education for 40 children over the age of two.</p><p>South Brighton is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides clear policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety, regular professional development support and opportunities for teachers. All teachers are fully qualified and registered as early childhood teachers.</p><p>Teachers work well together and provide a range of learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>inclusive and affirming relationships between children and teachers</li>
<li>attractive and well-resourced indoor and outdoor play areas</li>
<li>the way teachers effectively respond to children&rsquo;s interests and abilities</li>
<li>partnerships between home and the kindergarten.</li>
<li>The next step is for teachers to strengthen assessment and self-review processes.</li>
</ul><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
