</table><p>Three Kings Community Kindergarten Inc¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Three Kings Community Kindergarten Inc is an established service, licensed to provide for 30 children over the age of two years. Children participate in both sessional or full-day education and care. They play in a converted classroom with an extensive outside area, situated beside Three Kings School. The centre caters for a wide variety of diverse learners, including children with MƒÅori and Pacific heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by a board comprised of parents and families of the children enrolled in the centre. The board provides governance and management support for the head teacher.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy centres on children and their learning. It emphasises working in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau, and the value of difference and diversity.</p><p>The head teacher and two other qualified teachers are new to their roles since the 2015 ERO review. The board are presently recruiting one more permanent qualified teacher. The board and team continue to be well supported by a long-serving administrator.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified many good practices to do with the programme, the environment and relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. These continue to be evident. However, staff turnover has meant that areas identified as next steps in curriculum and management continue to be areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is going through a time of significant change. The board has effective systems and structures in place that should serve them well as the new teaching team is established. A useful three year strategic plan, policies and annual action plan, guide the kindergarten's direction and identify appropriate goals. When the new team is established, a priority for them is to review the philosophy and to develop shared understandings of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017,</em> the revised early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children direct their own play by choosing from the richly resourced environment. Teachers set up the environment to encourage children to explore and be creative. The large outdoor area promotes children's physical development and fosters challenge and problem-solving. Relationships between adults and children are positive and considerate. Children with additional learning needs are well cared for and supported.</p><p>Parents are increasingly partnering in their children's learning. Parents willingly share their knowledge and skills at cultural celebrations and attend events and functions. The head teacher has appropriately identified the benefit of sharing current good early childhood learning with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children's learning stories identify their growing interests, skills and learning dispositions over time. The head teacher has helpful guidelines to assist teachers with planning programmes to respond to and extend children's learning. Learning stories should also explicitly acknowledge children's language, culture and ethnicity.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes are becoming established. A range of people's perspectives are gathered to inform evaluation and review. Internal evaluation could be enhanced by developing indicators of good practice related to the area for evaluation, and by referring to relevant current research and theory. Placing a stronger focus on outcomes for children's learning in evaluation findings would further strengthen the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board chair and the head teacher agree that the key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening programme planning to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by making stronger links to outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build teachers' understanding and use of the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Three Kings Community Kindergarten Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>18 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
