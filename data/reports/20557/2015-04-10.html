</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Carlson Community Kindergarten is located in the grounds of the Carlson School for Cerebral Palsy in Epsom. The kindergarten is licensed to provide sessional or full-day education and care for up to 30 children over two years of age. It is governed by a board of governors which is largely composed of parents of children attending the kindergarten. Families attending the centre are predominantly NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, Chinese and Indian, with a small number of children from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>A new centre manager works closely with three teachers and an administrator. Staff take leadership roles and work together well as a cohesive team.</p><p>Children are cared for within a converted classroom, and have an outdoor play area to enjoy. They receive a structured programme designed to reinforce independence, self-help skills and learning and exploring through play.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report on Carlson Community Kindergarten identified a number of areas of good performance and noted the positive interactions between teachers and children. It recommended that teachers source professional support for programme planning and assessment. The report also noted that teachers should plan for more child-directed programmes that focused on children‚Äôs emerging interests. The centre has responded well to the recommendations in this report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a good sense of belonging in the kindergarten. They are well settled and highly engaged in the programme. Children interact positively with each other and are inclusive in their play. They choose freely from activities provided, playing with and alongside others, and having ready access to the indoors and outdoors areas.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs focus on respectful, reciprocal relationships between teachers and children and between children themselves is clearly evident. Teachers support children as successful and capable learners. Children are trusting and confident with teachers.</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers know children and their families well and have established a welcoming environment for all families. They offer parents increasing opportunities to share information about their children and to have input into the programme.</p><p>The kindergarten environment is well established and promotes children‚Äôs creativity and exploration. Children have good access to a wide range of equipment and resources. The redesigned outdoor area is attractive and inviting for children. Both indoor and outdoor areas are well resourced.</p><p>Teachers encourage a child-initiated programme for children. They have high expectations of children‚Äôs behaviour and reinforce these expectations. All teachers need to continue reflecting on their practice and to build agreed understandings of what makes for culturally inclusive practices to help ensure they are responding well to children's ethnic diversity. Teachers continue to promote an appropriate curriculum that supports children‚Äôs individual and group interests. Planning and assessment processes are evident. Children‚Äôs learning journeys are recorded in portfolios.</p><p>In order to further strengthen planning and evaluation teachers should now:</p><ul>
<li>embed effective ways to notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs interests</li>
<li>use observations of children‚Äôs emerging interests to strengthen teachers planning for individuals and groups</li>
<li>develop more robust and reflective evaluation processes</li>
<li>implement bicultural practices to build on relevant te ao MƒÅori practices</li>
<li>strengthen the recording of children‚Äôs learning and development over time</li>
<li>consider ways in which the diversity of children‚Äôs language, culture and identity can be reflected in programme planning</li>
<li>encourage parents and whƒÅnau to contribute further to their children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre has established a process for self review that is both documented and inclusive of parents‚Äô feedback. It may be timely now for teachers to review this process to strengthen its capacity to gather multiple perspectives. It would also be useful to introduce criteria into the review process in so that decisions made about centre needs are closely linked to criteria set for goal achievement.</p><p>The centre manager and governing board work together collaboratively. The governing board supports the manager and teachers to run the daily operations. Good accountability processes are followed and plans are in place to guide future directions for the centre. These plans need to be closely monitored to ensure timely progress is made in achieving strategic goals and annual plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the board of governors and centre manager agree that to enhance the quality of practices in the centre, the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen management and leadership processes</li>
<li>strengthen and embed effective curriculum implementation so that it is informed by high quality assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>develop shared understandings of effective teaching practice</li>
<li>ensure that strategic and annual planning includes relevant detail in order to measure and review progress against strategic and annual goals on a regular basis.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Carlson Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Carlson Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
