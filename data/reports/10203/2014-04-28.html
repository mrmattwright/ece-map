</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kowhai Corner in Kaikohe, Northland, is a well established family-owned service that caters for 33 children up to five years of age. More than ninety percent of the children enrolled are of MƒÅori descent. The centre has two separate areas that cater for infants and toddlers, and for older children. Infants and toddlers have frequent opportunities for mixed-age play in the spacious environment provided for older children.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report noted the good alignment between the centre‚Äôs programme and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The report also noted the centre‚Äôs positive community and whƒÅnau relationships and authentic MƒÅori learning contexts. These very good practices remain highly evident. In 2011, ERO recommended that children‚Äôs learning be extended and the quality of assessment records and self-review systems improved. The current teaching team has worked to improve these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A sense of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and aroha provide an inclusive and welcoming environment for children. Relationships between children, families and teachers are caring and supportive. Parents report that they are very satisfied with the centre.</p><p>Tuakana/teina relationships are well promoted amongst children. Older children actively care for their younger peers. Infants and toddlers receive good levels of care from affectionate and responsive staff.</p><p>Older children demonstrate a sense of themselves as capable, independent learners and benefit from long periods of uninterrupted play. Children demonstrate positive social skills and collaborate to make decisions about their play. They ask teachers for help when necessary.</p><p>The programme includes some positive, meaningful conversations about children‚Äôs ideas and activities. Teachers listen carefully to children and foster their independent thinking. Some teachers use te reo MƒÅori well and children are very familiar with its use. Teachers are keen to improve their current practices. A useful strategy would be to consider further ways to promote complexity in children‚Äôs play and encourage literacy and numeracy learning.</p><p>The spacious physical environment offers children a variety of challenges and opportunities for exploration. Children freely select from the resources available. A specific area contains a selection of resources for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Teachers are reviewing programme management systems and how well they respond to the interests of individual children. Planning learning possibilities to extend children‚Äôs learning is a next step. More specific planning for individual children would enable teachers to evaluate the impact their programme and teaching practices are having on children‚Äôs learning. Teachers continue to seek ways to encourage parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to the assessment of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Collaborative management, leadership and team approaches are highly evident. Management systems and processes for making decisions and reviewing policies are well established. The experienced owners are committed to transitioning staff into leadership positions to ensure the long-term sustainability of the centre. To support ongoing centre improvement, teachers could continue to strengthen self-review processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>use an effective teacher profile to guide improved teaching practices</li>
<li>focus programme planning, assessment and evaluation processes on learning outcomes for children, and documenting children‚Äôs progress over time</li>
<li>develop improvement focused goals to guide ongoing annual and long-term development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kowhai Corner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, centre owners should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>items on shelves in the infant and toddler area are securely stored</li>
<li>performance management systems for teachers align with the registered teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kowhai Corner will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>28 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
