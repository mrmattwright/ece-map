<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau is located in Christchurch. Since the September 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. The kindergarten currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two years old. The kindergarten is licensed to take up to 40 children over two years of age. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>welcoming and affirming relationships between teachers, children and families</li>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on supporting children&rsquo;s well-being, sense of belonging and fostering of successful relationships between children</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; use of high quality interactions to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning</li>
<li>well organised and effectively resourced indoor and outdoor areas</li>
<li>a programme where children are encouraged to lead their play, make their own choices and follow their interests.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work well together as a team to support children&rsquo;s learning during the programme. They have good systems for making learning meaningful and visible to children and their parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The next steps for the teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase their use of te reo M&#257;ori across the kindergarten programme</li>
<li>strengthen some of their practices in children&rsquo;s assessment and self-review to build on their current good practices.</li>
</ul><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were still responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, and personnel. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Teachers aim to provide a warm and welcoming environment to support children&rsquo;s learning. Children are viewed as competent and confident learners who can lead their own learning. Strong emphasis is placed on the importance of involving family and wh&#257;nau in the kindergarten programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Children are benefitting from strong relationships with teachers who know them and their families well. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>affirming and meaningful relationships between teachers and children</li>
<li>children being well supported by teachers to play cooperatively and successfully with their peers</li>
<li>teachers relating to parents in positive and constructive ways.</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed high quality interactions. Teachers made good use of a wide range of ways to help children talk about their ideas and thinking and extend children&rsquo;s learning. All teachers consistently responded to children&rsquo;s interests and needs in thoughtful ways. Teachers showed respect for children as competent and confident learners.</p><p>Children learn in a well organised and effectively resourced environment. Teachers have made good use of self-review to inform their decisions about the range of resources and layout of particular play areas, such as art and collage. Teachers encourage children to use all aspects of the environment and in respectful ways.</p><p>Children are encouraged to lead their play, make their own choices and follow their interests. ERO observed children who could talk confidently about their play and learning. Children remained interested in their play for long periods of time. They were skilled at taking on roles in like leading, modelling and involving others in their play.</p><p>Children are well supported by teachers and have a good sense of well-being. ERO observed teachers using an effective range of strategies to help children settle and become involved in the programme. Teachers showed care and consideration for children&rsquo;s emotional well-being.</p><p>Teachers work well together as a team to support children&rsquo;s learning during the programme. They regularly share useful information that helps them respond to children in more meaningful ways.</p><p>There are good systems for making learning visible to children and their parents and wh&#257;nau. Teachers document useful discussions about individual children, their learning and how they will support future learning. They maintain attractive profile books for each child that are specific to their learning and interests. These are regularly shared with parents and displayed prominently in the kindergarten. Stories about children&rsquo;s learning have good information about what children think and their parents&rsquo; perspectives.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Teachers could strengthen their use of te reo M&#257;ori across the kindergarten programme. This would provide children with opportunities to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori in a wider range of circumstances.</p><p>Assessments could now be strengthened to build on current self-review practices.</p><p>Since the September 2008 ERO review, teachers have improved self-review systems. Teachers are provided with a useful format to guide this process. To further improve self-review teachers should make better use of this format to guide spontaneous and long term programme review.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-mairehau" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau is located in Christchurch. Since the September 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. The kindergarten currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two years old. The kindergarten is licensed to take up to 40 children over two years of age. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>welcoming and affirming relationships between teachers, children and families</li>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on supporting children&rsquo;s well-being, sense of belonging and fostering of successful relationships between children</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; use of high quality interactions to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning</li>
<li>well organised and effectively resourced indoor and outdoor areas</li>
<li>a programme where children are encouraged to lead their play, make their own choices and follow their interests.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work well together as a team to support children&rsquo;s learning during the programme. They have good systems for making learning meaningful and visible to children and their parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The next steps for the teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase their use of te reo M&#257;ori across the kindergarten programme</li>
<li>strengthen some of their practices in children&rsquo;s assessment and self-review to build on their current good practices.</li>
</ul><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were still responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, and personnel. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
