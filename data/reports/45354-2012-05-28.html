<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">ELCM Alfriston College is the first full-day education and care service established by the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). The centre was opened in 2009 next to Alfriston College in Manurewa and provides for up to 50 children. Infants and toddlers in the Pohutukawa room have a separate outdoor space alongside the shared area for older children based in the Pukeko and Kowhai rooms.</p><p align="left">Features of ELCM Alfriston are the high expectations of both teachers and children, and the purposeful way in which managers and teachers have identified and enact their beliefs, values and curriculum priorities. Managers and teachers have established respectful and collaborative relationships with children and their families. They have created an inviting, homely atmosphere that supports children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. The richly resourced environment encourages exploration and is highly conducive to learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; view of children as capable, competent and independent learners is reflected in the programmes in action. They work alongside children to support and build on their ideas, promote ongoing investigations and extend learning. Teachers use effective strategies to support children&rsquo;s language development, and to integrate literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful ways throughout the programme. They demonstrate a commitment to recognising the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa and valuing the diverse cultures of their community.</p><p align="left">Children have many opportunities to take leadership and responsibility and to contribute to decisions about programme development. They are highly engaged in interesting, challenging and varied learning experiences. Manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are valued and clearly evident in the centre.</p><p align="left">ELCM Alfriston benefits from the CMKA&rsquo;s well-established professional practices, self-review systems, and comprehensive management and administration framework. Through effective professional leadership and a growing culture of reflective practice, the teaching team is developing shared understandings about the philosophical approaches that underpin teaching and learning in the centre.</p><p align="left">Managers and teachers are keen to continue building depth in their reflective thinking, and rigour in their self review. This should help to generate further growth in their understanding and enrich the centre&rsquo;s community of learners.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of ELCM Alfriston College was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atELCM Alfriston College.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre opened in 2009. The centre manager and assistant manager are part of a team of ten registered teachers, and are assisted by additional staff who are in training. The centre offers full-day programmes and up to ten places for children attending morning or afternoon sessions.</p><p align="left">The Pohutukawa room provides focused care and education for up to ten infants and toddlers, with a separate outdoor area. The Pukeko room caters for up to 20 children between two and four years of age. The Kowhai room caters for children who are mostly over the age of four years. The Kowhai and Pukeko children share an outdoor area and are able to join activities in each others&rsquo; rooms.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><em>Underpinning beliefs.</em> Managers and teachers have clearly articulated their shared teaching philosophy, values and beliefs. Their teaching practices are grounded in the principles and strands of Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum, and inspired by Reggio Emilia and Pikler approaches. Teachers see children as inherently competent and capable, and place a high value on the child&rsquo;s voice. They view the environment as the &lsquo;third teacher&rsquo; and clearly demonstrate their role in fostering and celebrating children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers&rsquo; underpinning philosophy and beliefs are woven through programme and self-review documentation, and are visible in the centre&rsquo;s high quality practices.</p><p align="left"><em>Relationships and belonging.</em> Establishing strong communication and fostering supportive professional relationships amongst staff and with families has been a priority for managers. A culture of respect for people and the environment is evident throughout the centre as teachers and children work together. Opportunities for older and younger children to work together support tuakana/teina relationships. These factors contribute to the family atmosphere and sense of community in the centre.</p><p align="left"><em>Learning environment.</em> Teachers have created an inclusive, homely atmosphere using furnishings, family photographs and cultural artefacts, and natural resources. Innovative and creative thinking contribute to a vibrant environment, that includes:</p><ul>
<li>attractively presented spaces with abundant resources that invite investigation, provoke children&rsquo;s curiosity, and support increasingly complicated, child-directed learning</li>
<li>easily accessible outdoor areas that are very well landscaped and resourced to offer interest, challenge and opportunities for extended exploration</li>
<li>well presented displays of photographs and documentation that show how the programme evolves in response to children&rsquo;s interest and engagement in ongoing investigations, and enables children and adults to revisit prior learning</li>
<li>a calm, settled atmosphere with flexible routines that allows children to sustain play interests for long periods and encourages them to be self managing and independent.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children collaborate with teachers and each other to make decisions about where they will work and how they will use resources to extend their play ideas and their thinking about topics of interest.</p><p align="left"><em>Integrated curriculum.</em> Teachers are becoming skilled in supporting ongoing investigation and extended learning. They promote rich vocabulary and foster thinking and reasoning as they engage with children. Literacy learning, mathematics and science concepts, and creativity are incorporated in meaningful ways in the context of child-initiated play. Diverse cultural celebrations are a regular part of centre programmes.</p><p align="left">Teachers use simple te reo M&#257;ori naturally in the course of conversation. They value the support and encouragement of a M&#257;ori staff member as they increase their confidence and understanding about tikanga M&#257;ori. Children are familiar with waiata and lead karakia.</p><p align="left"><em>Professional leadership and management.</em> A sense of purpose and vision characterises centre development. Managers have taken a measured and responsive approach to building a cohesive, collaborative teaching team and a culture of reflective practice. The centre manager challenges and provokes thinking, models effective practice and provides a supportive professional environment for staff.</p><p align="left">Ongoing professional development is a key component of sustaining good practice and continually building teacher capability in the centre. CMKA managers provide a professional framework for management and teaching, monitor centre operations, and promote high quality practices. Self-review processes are comprehensive, meaningful, responsive and contribute to ongoing improvement.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">ERO agrees with the areas for further review and development identified by centre managers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the extent to which children&rsquo;s portfolios reflect parents&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; knowledge of each child, show continuity and progression of learning, and indicate to parents how teachers plan to support and extend their child&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>documenting children&rsquo;s learning in user-friendly ways that help all parents to develop a shared understanding of the centre&rsquo;s philosophical approaches to teaching and learning</li>
<li>increasing depth and rigour in teachers&rsquo; reflective practice with a view to generating greater shared understandings about best practice, enhancing teacher practice and continually enriching programmes for children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO also suggests, and managers agree, that it could be worthwhile to consider Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s strategy for fostering success for M&#257;ori children, and the Pacific Education Plan as bases for consulting with parents/wh&#257;nau and strengthening these aspects of centre operations.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of ELCM Alfriston College completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>28 May 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-elcm-alfriston-college" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of ELCM Alfriston College</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on ELCM Alfriston College.</p><p align="left">ELCM Alfriston College is the first full-day education and care service established by the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). The centre was opened in 2009 next to Alfriston College in Manurewa and provides for up to 50 children. Infants and toddlers in the Pohutukawa room have a separate outdoor space alongside the shared area for older children based in the Pukeko and Kowhai rooms.</p><p align="left">Features of ELCM Alfriston are the high expectations of both teachers and children, and the purposeful way in which managers and teachers have identified and enact their beliefs, values and curriculum priorities. Managers and teachers have established respectful and collaborative relationships with children and their families. They have created an inviting, homely atmosphere that supports children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. The richly resourced environment encourages exploration and is highly conducive to learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; view of children as capable, competent and independent learners is reflected in the programmes in action. They work alongside children to support and build on their ideas, promote ongoing investigations and extend learning. Teachers use effective strategies to support children&rsquo;s language development, and to integrate literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful ways throughout the programme. They demonstrate a commitment to recognising the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa and valuing the diverse cultures of their community.</p><p align="left">Children have many opportunities to take leadership and responsibility and to contribute to decisions about programme development. They are highly engaged in interesting, challenging and varied learning experiences. Manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are valued and clearly evident in the centre.</p><p align="left">ELCM Alfriston benefits from the CMKA&rsquo;s well-established professional practices, self-review systems, and comprehensive management and administration framework. Through effective professional leadership and a growing culture of reflective practice, the teaching team is developing shared understandings about the philosophical approaches that underpin teaching and learning in the centre.</p><p align="left">Managers and teachers are keen to continue building depth in their reflective thinking, and rigour in their self review. This should help to generate further growth in their understanding and enrich the centre&rsquo;s community of learners.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
