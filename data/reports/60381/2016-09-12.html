</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Busy Beez Childcare Centre is a privately-owned service located in Upper Hutt. It is licenced to provide all-day education and care for 50 children, including 20 up to the age of 2 years. Of the 65 children enrolled, 15 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The building has been extended since the July 2013 ERO review. The indoor and outdoor environments provide opportunities for exploration and collaborative play for infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers.</p><p>The centre philosophy highlights the importance of respectful interactions, children's interests leading the curriculum, the significance as a Treaty partner in the heritage of Aotearoa and the provision of a safe and nurturing environment.</p><p>The previous ERO evaluation identified that the implementation of appraisal required strengthening. It also identified the need for teachers to develop knowledge, understanding, confidence and practices to foster language, culture and identity of MƒÅori learners. Staff are continuing their professional learning and development in bicultural practice.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children bring a range of interests and experiences to their play. They persevere, use their imagination and follow group or individual activities. Teachers are highly responsive to children and sensitively manage care routines.</p><p>The environment invites exploration and a sense of fun is evident. A wide range of carefully selected resources are made available to support, promote and extend children's learning. Opportunities to read, write and explore numbers are promoted.</p><p>Teachers closely observe play and plan the curriculum to follow children‚Äôs curiosity. Children are confident problem solvers. There is ample space for children to move about or to enjoy some quiet time.</p><p>Children's portfolios provide an attractive record of learning, celebrate milestones and successes. A range of communication strategies is used to effectively engage families in their children's' learning. Most parent aspirations are well reflected in narrative assessments.</p><p>An analysis of how well children's learning is documented is a next step. Strengthening the evaluation of planning to focus on and recognise children's learning rather than the activity, should give greater meaning to children's next learning steps and enable the identification of deliberate acts of teaching.</p><p>There are well considered transitions into and within the centre. A recent self review on the transition to school process has enabled teachers to provide more focused opportunities to assist children to settle more confidently into new entrant classes. Teachers have identified that growing community links and continuing their understanding of transition is an ongoing priority.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is based on partnerships and genuine attitudes of acceptance, respect, and a willingness to listen and change. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori is integrated throughout the programme. These attitudes and values provide a good foundation to support educational success for MƒÅori learners. A next step is to be more explicit when collecting and incorporating information from MƒÅori whƒÅnau to support their child's learning.</p><p>Cultural diversity is celebrated and is evident in practice. Utilising teacher expertise in Pacific language and customs is supporting capability. Continuing to deepen these relationships with these parents is a next step.</p><p>A well-established process and framework for self review is embedded and integral to the centre's operation. It is ongoing and responsive to priorities identified in the annual plan and focused on change and improvement which leads to in-depth reviews of targeted areas of practice.</p><p>Continuing to improve this process to lift teachers' practice from looking at what they do to finding out how effectively teaching strategies and programme initiatives impact on outcomes for children, would strengthen their evaluation capacity.</p><p>There has been significant progress in the development of a robust appraisal process. Teachers are reflecting and evaluating their professional growth with a focus on continuous development.</p><p>A strategic plan guides centre activities effectively, and is regularly reported on. A regular cycle of policy review and reports from the centre manager support the supervisor in her leadership role to ensure there are effective systems and processes. The centre philosophy is highly evident in guiding centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and Busy Beez management agree to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>collect and incorporate the aspirations of families who identify as MƒÅori and Pacific, to promote educational success for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build internal evaluation capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Busy Beez Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Busy Beez Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>12 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
