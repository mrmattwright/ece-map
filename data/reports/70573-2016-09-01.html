</table><p>Little Peppertree Preschool Ltd is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Peppertree Preschool is one of two Peppertree centres operating in Rangiora. This centre provides for children from two-years-old to school age. Children of all ages learn together in a converted home. Peppertree Preschool Ltd provides education and care for babies, toddlers and preschool children in three separate areas. The two centres are situated a short walk from each other and keep different opening hours. The centres share a similar philosophy and management structure. A review report has been written for each centre.</p><p>Nearly all staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers. Teachers are experienced with some having worked at the centre for a number of years. A curriculum leader has responsibility for the curriculum across the centres.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have made good progress towards meeting the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. They have made effective use of professional development to improve self review, child assessment and the quality of teaching.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two early childhood reviews in the Peppertree Preschool Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides a welcoming, friendly and homely environment for all children and their families. Parents and whānau partnerships in learning are strong. Parents are actively involved in developing goals and monitoring their children's progress.</p><p>A strong inclusive culture is evident. Children with diverse needs are respected and their specific needs are well met. Teachers effectively adapt programmes to ensure children with diverse needs are able to fully participate. Teachers, parents and outside agencies work effectively together to support children's learning and wellbeing needs.</p><p>Teachers ensure the unique bicultural nature of Aotearoa, New Zealand is well integrated and promoted within the programme and environment. They successfully include te ao Māori history, concepts and celebrations in the programme. Teachers are deliberately building their own and children's knowledge and use of te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Children benefit from positive, caring relationships with their teachers. The culture, language and identity of all children is recognised and respected. Interactions between teachers and children are encouraging and supportive.</p><p>Teachers effectively plan for, and assess, children's learning. They provide a wide range of activities and experiences that build on children's knowledge, interests and understandings. Learning environments are well presented with an interesting range of appropriate resources.</p><p>Children's independence is fostered. They are empowered to make choices about their own learning and remain engaged for some time. Teachers ably extend children's thinking, problem solving and reasoning abilities. Children are well supported to develop self-management and leadership skills. Literacy, mathematics and oral language development are successfully woven into learning programmes.</p><p>Managers and teachers make very good use of the wider local community to extend children's interests and learning. They are establishing useful processes, in consultation with local schools, to help children transition confidently from the centre to school.</p><p>Managers have put in place useful systems and processes for long-term and the day-to-day operation of the centre. Strategic planning, self review, staff appraisal and professional development are closely aligned to support achievement of centre goals to improve the quality of learning and teaching.</p><p>Managers and teachers have a strong focus on improvement and capacity building. They make effective use of professional development to build their practice and understanding in key identified areas. This is particularly evident in their shared understanding and use of self review and improved child assessment and programme planning. Staff appraisal processes have also been strengthened and staff receive useful feedback on their professional practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and ERO agreed, that the next key steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>embedding self review across all areas of centre operations</li>
<li>refining strategic planning</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the integration of te ao Māori in key management documents.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Peppertree Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Peppertree Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 September 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
