</table><p>Tahunanui Community Centre Inc is Well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tahunanui Community Centre Inc, commonly known as the preschool, provides education and care for children aged between two years and school age. It operates three days each week offering all-day and part-time placements within a small group setting. The preschool has strong links to the community, with many services for families operating on the same site.</p><p>The preschool is governed and supported by the Tahunanui Community Centre Inc board. The community centre manager is the licensee for the preschool. The head teacher is responsible for curriculum leadership. The centre employs two qualified early childhood teachers who are supported by an experienced teacher aide. There have been significant changes to board membership, leadership positions and the teaching team since the previous ERO review in 2013.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed and updated the centre philosophy to better reflect the values and beliefs of the current centre community in regard to children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The centre managers and teachers have maintained many of the positive features of the 2013 ERO report. They have begun to address the recommendations from the review, including developing a number of new systems and processes. They now need to refine and embed management processes and curriculum practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers warmly welcome families into the well-resourced and inclusive learning environment. They foster positive and respectful relationships with children and parents.</p><p>Children benefit from personalised transitions into the centre that are sensitive to the individual needs of the child and family. Teachers provide calm and caring interactions that help children to develop a good sense of belonging and wellbeing at the centre.</p><p>The child-centred programme is based on children‚Äôs interests and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers listen well to children. They promote children's oral language development and conversation skills. They are intentional in the ways they provide inviting learning areas and interesting outside spaces for children to investigate and explore. Children enjoy a wide range of activities including physical, imaginary and creative play; and literacy and leadership experiences.</p><p>Children are confident and responsive to predictable, enjoyable routines. They make good use of long periods of time, to make independent choices in the programme and follow their interests.</p><p>Children are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves and the environment, and to care for others. Teachers provide consistent, positive, guidance to help children initiate and maintain friendships. Children play well with, and alongside others. Older children often help younger children.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers communicate effectively and work well together. They model care and respect for children and one another. Strong links to the community, including the local school enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have a good focus on improvement and providing positive outcomes for children and families. They have developed a new strategic plan that aligns well to the relevant aspects of the Tahunanui Community Centre Inc plan. Teachers are making good use of a systematic and collaborative approach to spontaneous review to inform teaching and learning practices.</p><p>The board is well informed about the operation of the preschool, including the curriculum and special events, through regular useful reports. The board provides additional support for specific needs of children and families. The provision of appropriate professional development for teachers has a positive impact on teaching practices and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, head teacher and ERO agree that priority should now be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening self-review processes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing bicultural perspectives in documentation and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending the preschool strategic plan to include action planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining and embedding the appraisal process for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tahunanui Community Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tahunanui Community Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>26 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>
