</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned service situated in Carterton in the Wairarapa.</p>
<p>The centre operates from 7.30am to 5.00pm, Monday to Friday. It caters for children aged from birth to five years in two separate spaces; one for infants and toddlers and one for children aged from two to five years. Children move between the rooms at special times each day. The licence allows for 45 children, including up to 15 children under two years of age. There are nine children who identify as M&#257;ori. The service offers free transport to and from the centre for children.</p>
<p>Most members of the teaching team are qualified. An ownership change took place in 2014. Wellconsidered support is being provided for the new owner/manager and the new head teacher who is recently trained and new to her leadership role.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy has been reviewed and agreed to early in 2015. This supports the development of shared beliefs and values for the centre. The philosophy is evident in practice.</p>
<p>The centre is continuing to work towards achieving the recommendations made in the July 2012 ERO report.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing is the focus at McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre. Teachers provide a curriculum that is responsive to infants, toddlers and young children&rsquo;s interests. They work with the goals, dispositions and learning outcomes of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to respond to children&rsquo;s ideas. This supports children to develop their sense of worth. Inclusive practices ensure that all children&rsquo;s learning needs are catered for. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the programme.</p>
<p>The environment supports and encourages exploration and creativity. It offers challenges and interest to children&rsquo;s self-chosen play. Children are provided with a range of opportunities to explore their environment and participate in social learning experiences. The centre makes good use of local amenities.</p>
<p>Infants and toddlers are well supported through the responsive curriculum. They have access to their own separate environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration. Teachers are flexible and maintain a calm, slow pace so younger children have space and time to lead their own learning.</p>
<p>There is a strong emphasis on sustainable environmental practices. A wide variety of opportunities are provided for children to develop understanding through activities, resources and excursions.</p>
<p>Teachers maintain caring, positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. They are establishing a learning environment that contributes to positive learning outcomes for all children. Consistent practices are developing and focused on supporting wellbeing as teachers guide children to manage their feelings and behaviours.</p>
<p>The centre is welcoming to all. Partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau are developing. Teachers celebrate and acknowledge the different cultural perspectives that children and families bring to the centre. Parents have opportunities to contribute to a curriculum that is responsive to their cultures, languages and identities. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are well integrated into the learning programme and throughout centre procedures and practices.</p>
<p>Useful strategies are in place to promote children&rsquo;s successful transition to school and between centre areas. Families and children are well supported.</p>
<p>As part of the implementation of the redeveloped appraisal process, teachers are beginning to reflect on their teaching practices and the impact of these on outcomes for children. This process is supported by a contracted mentor. ERO agrees with the centre&rsquo;s decision to continue with this professional development.</p>
<p>There is an appropriate process for planning and assessment. Observations of children in everyday activities build teachers&rsquo; picture of what children know, understand, feel, are interested in and can do. The centre has developed systems which provide a suitable focus for planning, interpretation and analysis of each child&rsquo;s learning. Parents have opportunities through displays and profile books to contribute to their child&rsquo;s programme. Learning stories provide a clear picture of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>The head teacher is a competent practitioner, modelling good practices for other staff and parents. She shows good understanding of children and is well placed to lead this team to build their capability. She is well supported by the manager and through the centre&rsquo;s provision of well-focussed professional development.</p>
<p>Self-review guidelines, expectations and procedures are being established. The centre needs to continue to strengthen its processes to:</p>
<ul><li>respond to identified priorities</li>
<li>ascertain the effectiveness of practices</li>
<li>inform decision making</li>
<li>refine and streamline centre policies.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Management and ERO agree key next steps should include strengthening:</p>
<ul><li>self review and appraisal processes</li>
<li>teaching practice including teachers' critical reflection.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
