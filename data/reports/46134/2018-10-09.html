</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maketu EduCare provides education and care for up to 22 children from two years to school age, in a mixed-age setting. The current roll of 21, includes 14 MƒÅori children, many of whom whakapapa to Te Arawa and NgƒÅti Whakaue. The educare is an all-day service located on the grounds of Maket≈´ School. It is governed and managed by a charitable trust. The centre receives equity funding from the Ministry of Education and uses this to employ additional staff to enhance teacher-to-child ratios.</p><p>Through the philosophy teachers aim to work together with tamariki and their whƒÅnau, sharing skills to promote better outcomes. Understanding and respecting cultures, healthy food, oral health and life education are also valued in the philosophy.</p><p>ERO's last review in 2015 identified key next steps in the management of assessment, mat time organisation and its impact on children‚Äôs interest and enjoyment. These two aspects of practice continue to be areas for development.</p><p>Since the last review there have been significant changes to the teaching team and the centre‚Äôs relationship with the school.</p><p>Professional learning and development has focused on mathematics.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre priorities effectively promote positive outcomes for children. The recently reviewed philosophy is underpinned by shared values, including strong acknowledgement of MƒÅori as tangata whenua. The philosophy is integral to a strong sense of identity and belonging for all children, their families and centre staff.</p><p>The curriculum clearly reflects the local community and family aspirations for their children. MƒÅori children enjoy planned and spontaneous opportunities to engage, learn and make connections as MƒÅori in the centre and wider community. Teachers naturally integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori throughout the programme. Children respond positively to these experiences affirming their cultural identity. In addition, the sustained focus on 'Maths in Maketu' is extending children's and families understanding and use of mathematics in meaningful contexts. This approach supports continuity of learning for children between the centre, homes and wider community.</p><p>Respectful relationships are highly evident at all levels in the centre. Teachers are welcoming and inclusive of all children and their families. They celebrate each family's culture and acknowledge parent and whƒÅnau aspirations, valuing their involvement and contributions to the programme and centre events. Collaboration between families and teachers contributes to children‚Äôs self confidence and sense of security in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the licensee and head teacher agree that the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>re-establish a productive working relationship with the Maketu School board of trustees and principal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access support for the head teacher to provide professional leadership that extends the teaching capability of staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to review and develop assessment, planning and evaluation ensuring that all teachers understand and are able to contribute to these processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access professional learning and development for teachers to enable them to deepen their responses to what they notice and recognise about children‚Äôs interests, strengths, dispositions and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre management accesses external support to effectively respond to these key next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maketu EduCare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>a better standard of cleaning to ensure hygiene practices meet the standard</li>
<li>fire emergency drills are carried out and documented on at least a 3 monthly basis</li>
<li>furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage is secured. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS1, HS6, HS8]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should review current nappy change facilities to more appropriately cater for children‚Äôs ages and independence, and take account of staff wellbeing.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maketu EduCare will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>9 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
