<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Countrylife Daycare Limited operates an education and care programme for children from ten months to five years of age. The centre is purpose built, bright and spacious. It is situated in a rural farm setting where children are provided with opportunities to develop an appreciation of, and engagement with, nature and animal life. The centre was opened in 2009 and this is its first ERO review.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s health and physical well-being are effectively fostered through centre routines and the provision of nutritious meals and snacks. Routines are well established and understood by children.</p>
<p>Children participate in a free-play programme that offers a range of activities throughout the day. Teachers are aware of children's interests and use these as a starting point to engage and support them in their activities. Aspects of te reo M&#257;ori are integrated into the programme and routines. Interactions are affirming and supportive.</p>
<p>Teachers&rsquo; assessment practices require further development to ensure children&rsquo;s interests are identified and supported in a way that adds greater depth and complexity to their learning. Teachers have indicated their ongoing commitment to further their knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori and ERO agrees with this direction. Self review also requires strengthening.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Countrylife Daycare Ltd was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atCountrylife Daycare Ltd.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Countrylife Daycare Ltd opened in April 2009. Families attend from a wide range of suburbs. Since opening there has been high staff turnover and as a result centre wide professional development has not been undertaken. At the time of this review management indicated a stable team was forming.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Programme Children experience a child initiated, play-based programme. Teachers use their in-depth knowledge of the children to meet their play requirements. Children know the routines well and what is expected of them. Nutritious meals are served in a social setting. Some teachers use this routine time to support children&rsquo;s developing self-help skills.</p>
<p>Planned group experiences provide enrichment to the programme. Portfolios are well presented and provide a cumulative record of the child&rsquo;s participation in group experiences and individual activities. From the photographs and commentary parents can develop an appreciation for their child&rsquo;s growing social relationships and emerging interests. Children are familiar with these records and can access them to revisit past experiences.</p>
<p>Interactions Teachers are warm and responsive to children&rsquo;s care needs and emerging interests. ERO observed some interactions between teachers and children that fostered conversation and children&rsquo;s language development. Teachers provide structured opportunities for children to participate in music, movement and story time together.</p>
<p>Environment Wall displays are attractive and informative and show that children&rsquo;s work is valued. Children have access to a range of resources and learning experiences. The outdoor environment has a range of fixed and moveable equipment to support children&rsquo;s physical development. An edible garden and farm provide extension to the curriculum and assists children&rsquo;s developing understandings of the living world. The outdoor environment is subject to ongoing development.</p>
<p>Self Review As there have been several staff changes since the centre opened, the major focus of reflection has been on the establishment and implementation of management systems and daily routines. Recently, centre staff have used a good self-review model to reflect on selected aspects of the programme.</p>
<p>Strategic and Annual Plans The strategic plan has a clear vision with long term goals to support its realisation. The annual plan documents tasks expected to be completed within the year and how they link to development aims and legislative requirements.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation Some aspects of planning, learning and teaching practices require further development to add depth and complexity to children&rsquo;s learning. These include teachers:</p>
<ul><li>drawing on current educational theory and best practice to develop a shared understanding of high quality early childhood programmes for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>incorporating children&rsquo;s interests into group planning and using this as a vehicle to enable teachers and children to investigate the focus in greater depth</li>
<li>record learning that is significant to individual children</li>
<li>identifying and implementing opportunities and teaching strategies that extend children&rsquo;s learning across the curriculum on a daily basis.</li>
</ul><p>Interactions Teachers use of consistent strategies that promote children&rsquo;s self-management and leadership skills are not well used to foster their social and emotional competence and relationships.</p>
<p>Strategies to support children to develop their thinking and reasoning abilities are not well developed. Most teachers do not effectively capitalise on children&rsquo;s ideas or use open-ended questions to promote thinking and problem solving.</p>
<p>Self Review While there is evidence of critical reflection, centre wide self review requires strengthening. Management and teachers should give consideration to:</p>
<ul><li>ensuring there is clear alignment between the strategic and annual plans and delegated responsibilities</li>
<li>drawing on the monitoring tools that the centre has available to reflect on the effectiveness of practice</li>
<li>ensuring there is a schedule of planned self review.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Thirteen percent of the roll is M&#257;ori. Management and teachers actively seek parents&rsquo; views about the programme of learning and are receptive to their feedback.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Some teachers integrate basic te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme. Children respond appropriately. A recent self-review focus on the bicultural programme has resulted in furthering teachers&rsquo; knowledge and improved outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Teachers have identified the need to increase their confidence and skill as speakers of te reo M&#257;ori. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation agrees. Teachers should consider how a M&#257;ori world view is depicted through the environment and resources.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Countrylife Daycare Ltd completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p>
<div><ol><li>teachers will continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices to add greater depth and complexity of learning to enhance outcomes for individual children.</li>
<li>managers and teachers will continue to develop their understanding and practice of evidence-based self review for the ongoing improvement of all centre operations, and explore indicators of quality that support the implementation of the service philosophy.</li>
</ol></div>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-countrylife-daycare-ltd" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Countrylife Daycare Ltd</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Countrylife Daycare Ltd.</p>
<p>Countrylife Daycare Limited operates an education and care programme for children from ten months to five years of age. The centre is purpose built, bright and spacious. It is situated in a rural farm setting where children are provided with opportunities to develop an appreciation of, and engagement with, nature and animal life. The centre was opened in 2009 and this is its first ERO review.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s health and physical well-being are effectively fostered through centre routines and the provision of nutritious meals and snacks. Routines are well established and understood by children.</p>
<p>Children participate in a free-play programme that offers a range of activities throughout the day. Teachers are aware of children's interests and use these as a starting point to engage and support them in their activities. Aspects of te reo M&#257;ori are integrated into the programme and routines. Interactions are affirming and supportive.</p>
<p>Teachers&rsquo; assessment practices require further development to ensure children&rsquo;s interests are identified and supported in a way that adds greater depth and complexity to their learning. Teachers have indicated their ongoing commitment to further their knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori and ERO agrees with this direction. Self review also requires strengthening.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
