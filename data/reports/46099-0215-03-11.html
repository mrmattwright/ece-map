</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sandcastles Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned centre in Snells Beach, Warkworth. The centre opened in January 2013. It is owned and operated by an experienced early childhood teacher and most of the teachers are qualified. The premises have been thoughtfully renovated and resourced. This has created an attractive and stimulating learning environment for children from birth to five years. The centre is licensed for 34 children including eight under the age of two. This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is guided by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre‚Äôs curriculum has a strong focus on the use of natural resources and learning in and about the local community. Teachers provide an environment where children are valued as individuals, and where their curiosity is encouraged and extended. Children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning is the priority in centre decision-making.</p><p>The centre has an inclusive, family-oriented approach. Staff are committed to developing strong relationships and effective communication with families/whƒÅnau. Parents give positive feedback about the sense of family and the care and education provided for their children</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Sandcastles benefit from the warm, loving and caring relationships that characterise their interactions with teachers. They are supported to explore, grow and learn at their own pace within an environment that is stimulating and challenging.</p><p>Children are settled and engaged in their play. They are confident and articulate in interactions with each other and with adults. Children‚Äôs language skills are extended through meaningful play experiences and through the sustained conversations they have with teachers. High quality teaching practices; build on child-directed play, stimulate children‚Äôs thinking and creativity, and facilitate sustained, complex play.</p><p>Children are well supported to develop independence, self management and social skills. Teachers effectively incorporate early literacy and numeracy learning in meaningful ways.</p><p>Learning programmes are based on children‚Äôs emerging interests. Teachers make good use of the notice, recognise and respond model to assess and plan children‚Äôs learning. Children‚Äôs individual and group interests are regularly updated and evaluated. Good quality portfolios provide specific information about each child‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre is very well resourced with many natural materials. Children are able to use these in a variety of imaginative ways. The spacious environment is organised into discrete areas of play. This allows children to play independently or co-operatively. Indoor and outdoor areas provide many opportunities for exploration, choice and challenge. There are good opportunities for children of all ages to extend their physical skills.</p><p>Separate rooms and outdoor areas provide age appropriate care and learning activities. Children can interact with all staff and other children and enjoy the varied learning areas that the environment offers. Children of different ages are able to establish positive relationships. Older children support younger ones in their play and routines. Siblings are able to enjoy being with each other. Transition within the centre is well-considered and responsive to individual children‚Äôs requirements. Staff are building good relationships with local schools. This helps them to support older children‚Äôs transition from the centre.</p><p>Parents receive good information about their children's learning. They are encouraged to take an active part in centre events. Staff are continuing to increase opportunities for parents to contribute to the learning programmes. An electronic system for sharing children‚Äôs learning is about to be introduced. This should enhance communication with parents and enable them to have greater input into their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified that they want to strengthen how well the centre reflects New Zealand‚Äôs bi-cultural heritage. This could include increasing whƒÅnau and community voice as they work towards developing the centre‚Äôs bicultural practices.</p><p>Staff work collaboratively and have a culture of reflection. They are committed to ongoing improvement. The owner and head teacher provide high quality professional leadership. They are considering ways to further promote shared leadership opportunities. This would help to build sustainability.</p><p>Professional learning and development is purposeful and well considered. The centre owner has redesigned the staff appraisal process. She is continuing to refine this good system to incorporate more formal teacher reflection practices.</p><p>Useful self review processes have been established and the centre leaders are continuing to refine and strengthen these. ERO and centre leaders agree that further development could include improving documentation of review processes and outcomes.</p><p>The centre owner has developed a clear vision and strategic direction. This is informed by current best practice research and supported by well-aligned systems and practices. ERO supports centre leaders‚Äô intentions to further develop strategic planning processes.</p><p>Sound foundations have been established for high quality teaching and learning and operational practices. Centre leaders are considering how best to sustain their good practices, continue to build capacity and improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO affirms the centre‚Äôs plans to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop bicultural practices</li>
<li>embed and extend recently developed appraisal processes</li>
<li>continue to refine and extend self review processes and documentation</li>
<li>strengthen strategic planning processes and documentation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sandcastles Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sandcastles Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer¬†Northern</p><p>11 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
