</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre is situated in Levin. It is licensed for up to 15 tamariki, including seven up to the age of two years. Daily sessions are offered five days a week.</p><p>Teachers are fully qualified. They are supported by a management team consisting of the programme manager and an office manager.</p><p>The centre is governed by NgƒÅi Te Ao Incorporated Trust which has whƒÅnau, staff and NgƒÅi Te Ao hap≈´ representation. Leaders and teachers have strong links and working relationships with Mua≈´poko iwi and NgƒÅi Te Ao hap≈´.</p><p>This service has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy has recently been reviewed in consultation with the whƒÅnau. The philosophy focuses on tamariki as capable and successful achievers, the mana of tamariki being paramount, strong partnerships with whƒÅnau, and learning through play in any language. These curriculum emphases are clearly evident in all aspects of the service. A next step for the centre is to develop indicators of quality practice related to the philosophy statements.</p><p>The curriculum highly values and promotes mua≈´pokotanga. Leaders and teachers understand whƒÅnau, iwi and hapu aspirations and expectations. A key priority is to support Mua≈´poko iwi aspirations for their mokopuna so they can grow, share, promote and sustain the iwi kawa, reo, tikanga and identity.</p><p>Tamariki experience a rich, child-led bicultural curriculum that deeply respects their MƒÅori heritage. Centre routines build children‚Äôs leadership and knowledge of te ao MƒÅori. Tamariki learn their pepeha and have opportunities to acknowledge and celebrate their whakapapa.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are effectively promoted and well established. Tamariki are well supported to develop their oral language. Teachers use rich descriptive language in both te reo MƒÅori and te reo PƒÅkehƒÅ. Tamariki can respond in their choice of language. Te reo MƒÅori is used in all learning conversations. Waiata MƒÅori are well integrated into the curriculum. The dual heritage of children is acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Teachers know tamariki well as learners and respond appropriately to support their learning needs, and spiritual and physical wellbeing. Teachers extend tamariki interests through regular excursions to experience local marae, iwi kawa and events.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô needs for strong and secure attachment. They have access to an environment that enables them to mix with their older peers or to explore independently.</p><p>Tamariki profile books effectively capture milestones and learning experiences. Children‚Äôs voices are a feature of the books, providing their perspective on their learning. Planning is based on tamariki interests and needs. Children's next steps for learning are shared and planned for collaboratively by teachers.</p><p>Success for tamariki from Pacific ethnic groups is highly promoted through well-established relationships with the community. Teachers are developing understanding of how to better reflect and celebrate Pacific cultures in the curriculum.</p><p>Transition-to-school practices honour tikanga MƒÅori. Tamariki and their whƒÅnau are well supported with p≈çwhiri hand-over ceremonies on entry to their new schools. These provide opportunities for everyone to celebrate the children's new journeys.</p><p>A collaborative model of leadership is promoted. Teachers are encouraged to take on leadership roles. They have a strong commitment to the kaupapa, vision and direction.</p><p>Understanding and use of self review is developing in the centre. It is used to reflect on practice to help make improvements to the curriculum. Building teachers‚Äô and leaders‚Äô evaluative capability is a key next step.</p><p>Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed. They provide a good level of guidance for staff and the whƒÅnau. Leaders have identified that the appraisal process needs strengthening. Clearer alignment to the centre‚Äôs strategic goals, staff job descriptions and the Practising Teacher Criteria for registration is a key next step.</p><p>The service demonstrates a strong commitment to consulting with whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi involving them in decision making. Leaders and teachers recognise the importance of providing a kaupapa that is influenced by the aspirations that whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi have for their tamariki and mokopuna.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing indicators of quality practice linked to the philosophy</li>
<li>strengthening self review</li>
<li>enhancing the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
