</table><p>Fundamentals Marshland¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fundamentals Marshlands is one of two early learning services owned and operated by a family business in Christchurch. The centre caters for the learning and education of children aged two-to-five years old. Fundamentals Merivale is the other centre in Christchurch.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO report there have been significant changes to the ownership, leadership and administration of the service. The owner/manager and teaching team have developed a strategic, consistent approach to the operation and administration of both services.¬†</p><p>Leaders and teachers have established a shared vision and philosophy. The vision states ‚Äòour children enjoy a challenging and fun environment that encourages them to think, act and succeed in mind, body and spirit so they can become confident, independent life-long learners . The philosophy emphasises active movement, love of learning, respect, fun and collaboration for children.¬†</p><p>Fundamentals Marshlands caters for children's wellbeing and learning within a mixed-age group setting. There is a high ratio of teachers to children. All of the teachers, including the centre owner/manager, are either qualified and registered or involved in training.</p><p>This review was part of two education and care reviews in the Fundamentals ECE Ltd service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Respectful, reciprocal relationships underpin the service's strategic direction and curriculum which promotes positive outcomes for tamariki, whƒÅnau and teachers. The shared philosophy, vision and values are very evident in teacher practices, the environment and the learning programme. Teachers model care and respect for one another and for children and families.</p><p>Teachers promote a positive sense of wellbeing and belonging for children and families. ERO observed many parents comfortable to spend time at the centre with their children. Learner-centred relationships are actively fostered. The aspirations of parents are valued and used to inform individual planning and learning experiences of interest to children. Parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing through daily, face-to-face communication, informative wall displays and children's well written digital learning records.</p><p>The child-centred curriculum clearly defines the learning priorities for children to be socially confident, capable learners who are empowered to drive their own learning, take manageable risks and develop courage and resilience. Children have many opportunities to be involved in physical challenges within the spacious and well equipped inside and outside areas. Creativity, early literacy and science are well integrated into the learning programme in ways that are meaningful for children.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's individual interests, strengths and capabilities. Children with additional needs are well supported to succeed within an inclusive and collaborative learning environment.</p><p>The owner/manager has high expectations for teaching practice and learning outcomes for children. There is a deliberate focus on building leadership capacity, teacher capability and a collaborative team culture. Targeted external and internal professional development and individual support and mentoring are aligned to service priorities. A robust appraisal process and systematic approach to inquiry and internal evaluation is increasing the effectiveness of teachers' reflective and evaluative practices. Leaders value, and make good use of, the strengths and skills of the teaching team.</p><p>The owner manager has developed a systematic approach to the management and operation of the service. The strategic plan is well aligned to centre philosophy, internal evaluations, appraisal and professional learning. New systems and processes are well understood and used effectively by the teaching team. The learning and capabilities within this team are well used to support understandings of all teachers across the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>give prominence to bicultural perspectives and te ao MƒÅori practices in key centre documentation and practices</li>
<li>strengthen and embed new initiatives around assessment, planning and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and service leaders agree that refining the strategic plan to clearly identify key annual priorities and actions, would enable them to effectively monitor, evaluate and report on the progress of these strategic goals.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fundamentals Marshland completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the on-site stage of the review ERO identified that the hazard register needed to be improved to show how any identified hazards would be eliminated, isolated or made inaccessible to children. The health and safety officer addressed this concern promptly and developed a clear process to improve the identification and management of potential hazards.</p><p>ERO has identified, and service leaders agree, that the key next step is to ensure that hazard identification, management and assurance processes are robust and are regularly reviewed.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>15 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
