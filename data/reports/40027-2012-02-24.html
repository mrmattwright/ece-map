<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Port Ohope Playcentre is a parent-led, cooperative early childhood education service that caters for children from birth to school age. It operates under the umbrella of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. The association provides a range of policies that guide processes which contribute to safe and healthy practices in this centre.</p><p align="left">Adults work alongside children, making sure that all ages have access to a wide range of play experiences. Parent education courses are well supported and integral to the philosophy that promotes parents as the first educators of children.</p><p align="left">At the time of this ERO review, 23 children, predominantly of P&#257;keh&#257;/European descent, were enrolled. Parents in this centre are strongly committed to establishing a vibrant bicultural dimension in the centre. This commitment is enabling children to gain an understanding and appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p align="left">Centre members are dedicated to maintaining a high-quality learning environment. The centre is richly resourced and planned in response to children&rsquo;s interests, ages and stages of development. Children are able to make choices and initiate their own play. There are strong opportunities for creative expression and literacy, and mathematics and science are explored in contexts that are responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas and interests.</p><p align="left">The centre has well-developed self-review processes that take into account ideas and aspirations of all members. This process contributes to positive, ongoing improvements to the centre. To further enhance the quality of education, members now plan to consider ways to:</p><ul>
<li>extend children&rsquo;s ideas and ability to make decisions about their own learning;</li>
<li>strengthen children&rsquo;s records of learning to include possible adult responses to children&rsquo;s interests and learning dispositions; and</li>
<li>foster emergent leadership and shared workload in an environment where there is continual turnover of families and experienced members.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Port Ohope Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPort Ohope Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Port Ohope Playcentre operates under the governance and management of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. Centre members endorse the playcentre federation philosophy and have identified core values that guide centre operations and educational provision. These core values include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the mixed-age range of children with high adult to child ratios;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">being a family-based cooperative, with centre-based decision making and commitment to parent education; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">child-initiated and self-choice play in a fun environment that values biculturalism and provides a wide range of play areas.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">At the time of this ERO review, the centre had a strong group of core members. They are committed to the shared philosophy, parent education, and strive to continually improve the quality of education provided for children and families.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Philosophy in action</h4><p align="left">The Playcentre Federation philosophy and centre values are highly evident in the programme. Adults work closely alongside their children, ensure ready access to a wide range of play experiences, and value the parent education provided. They also enjoy a strong sense of community in this mixed-age group family/wh&#257;nau setting.</p><h4 align="left">Learning environment</h4><p align="left">Centre members at Port Ohope Playcentre are dedicated to maintaining a high-quality learning environment for children and adults. Play areas are richly resourced and planned in response to children&rsquo;s interests, ages and stages of development.</p><h4 align="left">Bicultural reflection</h4><p align="left">Centre members are strongly committed to establishing a vibrant, bicultural dimension in the centre. They value the knowledge, leadership and role modelling provided by some members, and an external facilitator is strengthening the use of te reo and aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori. Children are gaining an increasing understanding and appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><h4 align="left">Programme opportunities</h4><p align="left"><b></b>The programme successfully caters for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are able to make choices and initiate their own play. Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">strong opportunities for creative expression; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">integration of literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful contexts that are responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas and interests.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children are developing as capable learners who demonstrate belonging and confidence.</p><h4 align="left">Self review</h4><p align="left">The centre has well developed self-review processes. Reviews are both planned and spontaneous, and enable all members to contribute their ideas. Self review is well understood and is contributing to positive, ongoing improvements to the centre and outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Agreed priorities for development and review</h3><p align="left">ERO and centre members agree that the quality of education would be enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">considering ways to extend children&rsquo;s ideas and ability to make decisions about their own learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">strengthening children&rsquo;s records of learning to include possible adult responses to their interests and learning dispositions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">continuing to foster emergent leadership and shared workload in an environment where there is continual turnover of families and experienced members.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this parent-led service, members articulate a highly inclusive approach to catering for the identified needs of children with moderate to severe needs, should they be enrolled.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Port Ohope Playcentre completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they haveattested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-port-ohope-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Port Ohope Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Port Ohope Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Port Ohope Playcentre is a parent-led, cooperative early childhood education service that caters for children from birth to school age. It operates under the umbrella of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. The association provides a range of policies that guide processes which contribute to safe and healthy practices in this centre.</p><p align="left">Adults work alongside children, making sure that all ages have access to a wide range of play experiences. Parent education courses are well supported and integral to the philosophy that promotes parents as the first educators of children.</p><p align="left">At the time of this ERO review, 23 children, predominantly of P&#257;keh&#257;/European descent, were enrolled. Parents in this centre are strongly committed to establishing a vibrant bicultural dimension in the centre. This commitment is enabling children to gain an understanding and appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p align="left">Centre members are dedicated to maintaining a high-quality learning environment. The centre is richly resourced and planned in response to children&rsquo;s interests, ages and stages of development. Children are able to make choices and initiate their own play. There are strong opportunities for creative expression and literacy, and mathematics and science are explored in contexts that are responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas and interests.</p><p align="left">The centre has well-developed self-review processes that take into account ideas and aspirations of all members. This process contributes to positive, ongoing improvements to the centre. To further enhance the quality of education, members now plan to consider ways to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">extend children&rsquo;s ideas and ability to make decisions about their own learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">strengthen children&rsquo;s records of learning to include possible adult responses to children&rsquo;s interests and learning dispositions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">foster emergent leadership and shared workload in an environment where there is continual turnover of families and experienced members.</p>
</li>
