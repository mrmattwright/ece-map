</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidiwise Early Learning Centre is a privately owned teacher-led service that provides education and care for children from three months to school age. The service operates from 7.00am until 6.00pm Monday to Friday. It is licensed for 117 children, including 20 aged under two years. The environment includes four age-based areas on a site that features a large bush area for children's supervised play and exploration. The centre has a range of animals which the children can interact with as they play and learn. The current role of 128 includes 45 children who identify as MƒÅori, a small number of Pacific descent and 34 from a range of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Since the last ERO review in 2015 a fourth room has been added to cater more specifically for children from four years to school age.</p><p>The centre philosophy prioritises the 'importance of providing care and education for children which supports them in becoming independent, resilient and passionate learners with great social skills and a deep empathy for others and the environment'. The centre philosophy also promotes environmentally sustainable practices, healthy life style choices and respect for the natural world.</p><p>The previous ERO report in 2015 identified the need to further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staff appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whole-centre professional learning to strengthen strategic self-review practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Good progress has been made in developing appraisal processes, although further work is required to strengthening processes in relation to the endorsement of teachers' practising certificates. Further developments are still required to systems and practices related to programme assessment, planning and evaluation. Centre-wide professional learning has strengthened systems for strategic planning and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The environment actively promotes children‚Äôs curiosity, independence, active play and exploration. Activity-based planning increases children's access to a wide range of experiences. Excursions into the community extend opportunities for children to understand the world around them and local themes are incorporated into the programme to build children‚Äôs bicultural confidence. There are also a wide range of opportunities for parents and families to participate in organised events and celebrations by the centre.</p><p>Teachers know children well. Their interactions with children are nurturing and supportive of children‚Äôs confidence and sense of belonging. Children know the centre routines well and teachers' expectations are clearly conveyed. The next step for teachers is to further develop strategies to more consistently add depth and complexity to children‚Äôs interests and working theories.</p><p>Children aged under two benefit from designated primary caregivers who provide individual care routines, nurturing interactions and frequent communication with parents. These children also experience a large and well-resourced learning environment. Leaders and teachers are proactive in seeking support for learners with additional needs and there are clear processes to support identification, communication with parents and teaching strategies to appropriately respond to these learners' needs.</p><p>Children‚Äôs confidence is well supported by an individual approach to managing transitions into, within and beyond the centre. These processes are aligned to child readiness and include close communication with parents.</p><p>Aspects of the service‚Äôs governance and management systems are contributing to positive learning outcomes for children. These aspects relate to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the recent strengthening of internal processes to improve self review and inform change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an improved outcome-focused strategic plan that effectively supports centre-wide developments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies and procedural guidelines which have been enhanced, along with a more systematic approach to policy review. However, consistent implementation of these guidelines is now a priority across the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have a commitment to implementing the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre. Along with teachers, they have recently reviewed the bicultural curriculum. This review has resulted in improved opportunities to recognise and include MƒÅori learners‚Äô culture, language and identity in the centre programme. Teachers are working hard to include te reo in daily conversations with children.</p><p>Professional learning and development, focused on improving outcomes for children, is accessed by the centre. The current teacher appraisal system is under review to better support alignment to the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> document and the requirements of the Educational Council of New Zealand.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Improvements are required in assessment, planning and evaluation. These improvements are necessary to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>documentation better reflects individual children's progress and includes evaluation of how well programmes extend children‚Äôs learning overtime</li>
<li>the inclusion of a stronger parent voice throughout the curriculum</li>
<li>children‚Äôs assessments more consistently reflect their own language, culture and identity.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to develop strategies to more consistently scaffold children's ideas by adding depth and complexity to children‚Äôs interests and working theories.</p><p>Leaders and teachers need to build their understanding, and document centre-wide expectations for high-quality teaching practice, including assessment, planning and evaluation, and responding to parent aspirations. These should then be used to monitor and support improving capability and capacity of leaders and teachers.</p><p>Building understanding, and implementing effective leadership for centre-wide improvement is also an area for ongoing development. This is necessary to enable teachers to thoroughly and consistently implement the curriculum and centre policies and procedures.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidiwise Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the provision of a safe and effectively monitored learning environment for children.</p><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the provision of safety glass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hazard and risk management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Non-compliances identified in relation to:</p><ol>
<li>any window or other area of glass accessible to children are either made of safety glass, covered by an adhesive film designed to hold the glass in place in the event of it being broken or effectively guarded by barriers which prevent a child striking or falling against the glass</li>
<li>providing sufficient spaces for equipment and material to be stored safely. Stored equipment and materials can be easily and safely accessed by adults, and where practicable, by children</li>
<li>ensuring the centre dogs are restrained at all times when interacting with children. This must include monitoring the dogs‚Äô toileting, children are supervised when in contact with dogs and children wash hands after coming into contact with the dogs</li>
<li>ensuring that all reasonable steps are taken to identify, minimise and eliminate hazards and risks to children.</li>
</ol><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF7, PF8, HS16, HS12]</em></p><p>To improve practice leaders need to ensure the following aspects are addressed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the regular analysis of accidents should be undertaken to support identification of hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring policies and procedures are consistently implemented centre-wide, EG Sleep checks, hazard checks, excursion, the presence of poisonous plants, medical forms, Police vetting, sufficient raking of sandpits.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidiwise Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
