</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Grange Early Learning Centre is situated in Sunnyvale, West Auckland. The centre operates from a converted home and caters for infants and children through to school age. There has been a recent change in centre ownership.</p><p>Children attending the centre are representative of the diverse ethnic groups in the local community. Staff work at providing special events for families at times when working parents and whƒÅnau are best placed to attend. These events also provide good opportunities for parents and teachers to discuss children‚Äôs progress.</p><p>The manager and owner share responsibility for the day-to-day routines and programmes. The teaching team is made up of long serving and new teachers, all of whom are qualified and registered. Together they have addressed the areas of compliance identified in the 2012 ERO review, reviewed the centre‚Äôs philosophy, and developed a child-centred curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>On arrival, teachers welcome children and their whƒÅnau, invite children to participate and support them to settle in to the day‚Äôs routines. Teachers take time to talk with parents and whƒÅnau as children select activities, greet their friends and become engaged in play.</p><p>Children enjoy playing in the upgraded and challenging outdoor environment where they develop their physical skills and explore the adventure-style setting. They have good opportunities to develop social skills through play. Teachers change the equipment and areas of play to suit children‚Äôs current interests. Children respect their environment and appreciate the varying levels of challenge the outdoor space provides for them.</p><p>The centre programme provides a rich and varied range of experiences for children. Teachers plan meaningful and challenging learning activities, which are responsive to the interests and perspectives of children and whƒÅnau. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are well integrated into the learning programme. The programme also includes opportunities for children to learn about the local and wider community, and supports them well to become life-long learners.</p><p>Children under 2 years of age are well cared for. Centre managers are aware of the challenges of the limited space available for these younger children. Teachers provide opportunities for infants and toddlers to be included in play with older children. They have good access to outdoor play.</p><p>A significant feature of the programme is its focus on environmental sustainability. Skills learnt at the centre are put into use each week at the community garden, where children‚Äôs contributions are highly affirmed and encouraged.</p><p>Teachers have good quality assessment practices that are used to monitor children‚Äôs learning. They are becoming more strategic in supporting children to develop their verbal language skills and are using children‚Äôs words in their learning stories.</p><p>Centre managers and teachers strongly value communication with parents. They are working to improve the effectiveness of online sharing of information with parents. Managers are also developing record keeping systems to better capture information shared in daily meetings between parents and teachers, and in regular professional discussions between teachers. Work to develop a more formal approach to capturing parent and teacher input should help to improve planning for individual children.</p><p>Teachers are committed to offering a bicultural curriculum. They recognise that their understanding of bicultural practice needs to be further strengthened. Development in this area would help all teachers and children to understand the richness of New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. It would also provide more responsive support for children and their whƒÅnau who identify as Maori. Some good initiatives in this area are already underway.</p><p>The centre is well managed by the centre manager. Her reflective practice, positive attitude and pedagogical knowledge have enabled the centre to function efficiently through the change of ownership. The centre team has used its philosophy, annual goals and appraisal process well to guide its practices and to contribute to strategic goal setting. Feedback and discussion with the owner prompts ongoing improvement and encourages teachers‚Äô reflective practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self review so that it is systematic, robust and focuses on measuring the effectiveness of initiatives implemented</li>
<li>strengthening children‚Äôs use of ICT in the programme</li>
<li>further improving the way teachers plan for individual children‚Äôs interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Grange Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Grange Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern Select Region</p><p>26 January 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
