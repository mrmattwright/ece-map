</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hill Park Kindergarten is a well-established kindergarten, licensed for 40 children over two years of age. It operates daily from 8.45 am to 2.45 pm. The kindergarten's community is culturally diverse and includes significant groups of children with MƒÅori and Pacific heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) and operates under its policies and management framework. A CMKA education manager (EM) visits the kindergarten and provides leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The CMKA is in the process of reviewing its structures and operational framework.</p><p>The kindergarten teaching team includes a head teacher, three registered teachers, an administrator, and a teacher aide. Teachers implement a play-based curriculum that is grounded in the values of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, rangatiratanga and kaitiakitanga.</p><p>The kindergarten has faced a number of challenges since the 2014 ERO review, including relocating to a classroom within the adjacent school while the building underwent significant renovations.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report noted teachers' commitment to developing strong relationships with children and their families, and that children enjoyed a welcoming environment. Key next steps included the development of a systematic self-review process, promoting the cultural identities of all children, and strengthening planning to extend children's play. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of eight reviews in the CMKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten. They are well supported to be confident and competent learners within this positive environment. Children benefit from the respectful relationships they have with teachers and their peers. They settle well on arrival, selecting what interests them from the wide variety of play-based learning options and activities.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are welcome in the kindergarten and many spend time playing alongside their children before leaving. The kindergarten's warm and inviting environment fosters children's emotional wellbeing.</p><p>The curriculum reflects the kindergarten's philosophy and guiding documents. Implementation of the kindergarten's values are very apparent in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the peaceful, calm, unhurried pace of the learning programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' thoughtful presentation of the indoor and outdoor learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the extent to which the teaching team promotes meaningful whƒÅnau engagement with the kindergarten programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the establishment of family-based community support.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These values-based practices are a notable strength of the centre. They have been pivotal in maintaining the kindergarten's strengths during times of change.</p><p>Good quality teaching practices include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' willingness to adapt to the needs of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well implemented positive guidance approaches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing cultural responsiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the promotion of children's holistic learning and development, including their physical capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team have identified their next steps for further development. More robust internal evaluation processes, including the specification of indicators of best practice and expected outcomes, along with more flexible and responsive timeframes, should assist them in this endeavour.</p><p>Well-established CMKA management systems, policies and processes guide the kindergarten's practices. Embedding the practice of regular documented observations into CMKA appraisal processes would enhance the support provided for teachers' professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that their key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen the documentation of assessment, planning for learning, and intentional teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness of their teaching strategies and the outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop more robust internal evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>CMKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing consistent ongoing support for leaders and teachers that sustains leadership and improves teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, to identify priorities for learning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to increase the visibility of children's cultural identity and continuity of learning in their individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability and depth in internal evaluation across the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hill Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hill Park Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <i><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Service</a>s</i><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
