</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Huntly Kidz Childcare Centre is a privately owned early childhood care and education centre located on the southern side of Huntly. It is licensed for 46 children including 16 up to the age of two. The current roll of 52 children are mainly MƒÅori who whakapapa to hap≈´ within Tainui. Other children in the centre come from a range of diverse ethnic backgrounds. The centre runs an all-day service from 7.00 am until 5.30 pm. There are two learning areas in the centre, one for children up to the age of two and one for children over two.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2013 the ownership and leadership of the centre has changed. The majority of teachers are also new to the centre. The new owners manage the centre on a day to day basis while the experienced head teacher provides professional and programme leadership to the teaching team. The majority of staff are fully qualified.</p><p>The new team has responded well to the areas for review and development identified in the last ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre and this contributes to a strong sense of whanaungatanga and belonging. WhƒÅnau aspirations for their children are valued. Teachers relate to children with respect and humility.</p><p>Children benefit from a programme based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Early concepts of literacy and mathematics are integrated meaningfully into children's play. They experience a programme including the arts, science and technology, construction and music and movement. The indoor environment for the under two children and the outdoor environment for the over twos have recently been refurbished in order to extend children's learning and thinking. Quality mat times provide opportunity for focussed literacy and mathematics learning. Flexible routines promote a sense of well-being and are used to develop children's independence and self-management skills.</p><p>Children's growing understanding of themselves as kaitiaki of the world around them is an ongoing curriculum focus. The development of social skills such as making and maintaining friendships and solving problems when playing together are encouraged.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are well provided for in a centrally located and well-equipped space. They are able to lead their own play and exploration. Teachers are gentle and caring. A structured but flexible transition in to the over-two area ensures their learning is not disrupted.</p><p>Children's identity as MƒÅori is reinforced by deepening their understanding of atua MƒÅori such as TƒÅne and TƒÅwhirimƒÅtea. The curriculum embraces this learning.</p><p>Teachers' planning begins with a focus on children's interests. A learning disposition such as building confidence or providing opportunities for trial and error is identified along with a valued outcome and for MƒÅori children learning about a MƒÅori view of creation. Activities and experiences that encompass these areas are then developed. Learning interests are more intentional and meaningfully integrated into children's play.</p><p>Assessment portfolios have recently been strengthened so that they clearly capture the child's interests and learning.</p><p>Teachers regularly reflect on their practice. Their skills in noticing and responding to children's ongoing learning has been strengthened through the appraisal process, as have their skills in managing children's behaviour.</p><p>ERO observed examples of open-ended questioning, support for oral language development, and supporting rather than directing children's play. This support is allowing teachers to systematically extend children's thinking and build complexity into their learning.</p><p>The head teacher has developed a strong, professional team culture. Teachers and leaders work collaboratively to ensure positive outcomes for children and whƒÅnau. High levels of trust and sound systems for giving and receiving feedback, managing change and maintaining effective working relationships are contributing to continuous and ongoing improvement in teacher practice. Teachers feel valued and are strongly committed to ensuring positive outcomes for all children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>An effective mixture of centre-wide and individual professional development supports teacher's ongoing improvement. A new on-line appraisal system has enhanced the way they reflect on their practice and discuss the way they improve outcomes for children, parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The new owners have strengthened financial management and health and safety systems. A sound policy framework guides daily practice. A collaboratively developed strategic plan includes clear priorities for improving the quality of care and education at the centre. A newly developed process for self-review has led to meaningful change and continued improvement.</p><p>Equitable early childhood care and education is provided for children and their whƒÅnau in the Huntly community. Leaders value their community and continue to find ways of engaging with them in order to provide more learning opportunities for children. These engagements ensure the centre closely reflects the culture of the community and its aspirations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to continue to improve practice the centre should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the ways the children's Waikato-Tainui and Kƒ´ngitanga heritage is reflected and made visible in all aspects of the centre and its programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen parent involvement and cultural input to ensure that all children's diverse cultural heritages are acknowledged and celebrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a system of ongoing cyclic curriculum review to ensure that current theory and best practice is reflected in teacher practice and programme resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen planning and assessment for individual children to promote a more systematic response to each child's learning and development and show progress over time.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Huntly Kidz Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Huntly Kidz Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>15 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
