</table><p>Discovery Early Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Discovery Early Learning Centre is a privately-owned service in Kelson, Lower Hutt. The centre is licensed to provide full-time education and care for 36 children aged from two years to school age. The centre is governed by the Discovery Christian Centre Trust and operates in a purpose-built complex, alongside other community services the trust provides.</p><p>Since ERO's November 2016 report, a new head teacher and assistant head teacher have been appointed. A general manager manages the day-to-day operations as well as supporting the teaching team. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy emphasises the uniqueness of every child who is a precious gift with God-given strengths. 'Through loving relationships, we nurture the growth of each child‚Äôs spirit, body, and mind - taha wairua, taha tinana, taha hinengaro.'</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included strengthening aspects of review and evaluation, assessment and planning, MƒÅori success as MƒÅori, aspects of the appraisal system, and clarifying roles and responsibilities. Progress is ongoing to address some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play, learn and have fun in a calm and unhurried free-play programme. They are encouraged to explore and work independently and to create and learn with their peers. Teachers work alongside them, using a range of strategies to support and extend their interests. Oral language and mathematics concepts are promoted. Positive, respectful interactions are highly evident.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy was developed collaboratively by leaders, teachers, parents, whƒÅnau and children to determine what learning matters here and to define educational success. It is timely for the centre to review the philosophy to ensure it reflects current parent, family and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported through an inclusive programme. The centre works with external agencies as appropriate.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are valued and celebrated in the centre. Purposeful kaupapa MƒÅori rituals and resources support the programme. Excursions to the local awa enrich children‚Äôs learning. Leaders and teachers should explore how they can better promote places of value for MƒÅori in the curriculum. This should further enhance children‚Äôs understanding of te ao MƒÅori. Teachers should encourage greater use of te reo MƒÅori in every day conversations with children.</p><p>Purposeful group and individual planning are based on teacher-led and child-initiated interests. Teachers recognise what is important for learning through using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to develop specific learning goals and meaningful learning experiences. An online assessment tool provides opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to their children's learning stories. Leaders should consider how to better develop purposeful partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children‚Äôs taonga books provide a record of their developing friendships, learning and participation in a wide range of rich learning experiences. Teachers should enhance assessment documentation to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explicit intentional teaching strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how children‚Äôs culture, language and identity are celebrated</p>
</li>
<li>how children, their parents and whƒÅnau are supported through well-considered transition processes to school.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders are improvement focused. They use internal evaluation to reflect on and improve the curriculum. A next step is to build teachers' knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation so that they can more effectively measure the impact of their practices on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>A clear strategic plan guides the centre direction. Well-defined roles and responsibilities are in place. Leaders and teachers are highly committed to the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre.</p><p>The centre has an appropriate appraisal framework to support and grow teacher capability. Purposeful goals focus on building teacher practice and leadership. Observations are used to identify good practice and inform next steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy to ensure it reflect parent, family and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote places of value for MƒÅori in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' evaluation capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Discovery Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Paterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
