</table><p>Te whare Manaaki¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te whare Manaaki is situated in the children‚Äôs ward of Nelson Hospital and opened in November 2016. It provides a service for children admitted to the ward, and for their whƒÅnau and siblings. The service aims to promote a whƒÅnau-centred, supportive learning environment that celebrates every child‚Äôs uniqueness as a learner.</p><p>The service was established through a partnership between the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (the association) and Nelson Marlborough Health. The playroom used by the service is provided by the hospital, and the association provides staffing and the infrastructure for the management of the service.</p><p>The service is governed and managed by the association. The Chief Executive Officer and a board of trustees are responsible for the service meeting its legal obligations. A team of senior education advisers (SEA) oversees and supports the professional practice of the teaching team.</p><p>Day-to-day management of the service is undertaken by the early childhood qualified head teacher who, in this context, is known as a hospital play specialist (HPS). A play assistant completes the team. They work in conjunction with the multidisciplinary teams responsible for working with children and their families.</p><p>The playroom is licensed for 12 children, including six up to two years of age. The number of children in hospital who might use the service fluctuates daily. Some play and learning opportunities with children are undertaken at their bedside and in other parts of the hospital. This support is aimed at increasing children‚Äôs awareness and resilience in dealing with the complex medical procedures occurring.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service is welcoming to every child and their whƒÅnau. The HPS team works thoughtfully to meet the needs of the diverse learners who participate in this service. They maximise the opportunity to further their knowledge of special learning needs and ethnically diverse communities. Positive and sensitive relationships are developed between the HPS team, children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children have the opportunity to engage in a well-resourced, play-based programme. These experiences encourage exploration that is meaningful, challenging and enjoyable. Children's art work is valued and often revisited over time. This helps to foster a sense of belonging. The HPS makes links between the child‚Äôs home centre and the visit to Te whare Manaaki, and this is enhanced further through the sharing of assessment documentation.</p><p>Wellbeing of children and whƒÅnau is a priority for the HPS team members, who are highly responsive in their approach to supporting children to develop their knowledge and understanding of the medical procedures they are undergoing. This includes supporting children to understand the medical language used with them. Through play, this approach builds children‚Äôs confidence and ability to self-regulate. Medical staff are aware that the work and planning of the hospital play specialist team has a positive impact on children‚Äôs confidence and sense of wellbeing.</p><p>A range of information, including from multidisciplinary healthcare teams, is used to provide a comprehensive view about each child the HPS will visit. This information informs how the HPS will work with and support each child. Assessment acknowledges the meaning children are making of their healthcare and hospital experiences. Parents' feedback indicates that the support provided for both themselves and their child is appreciated.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is evident and valued. Resources reflect the service's commitment to the provision of aspects of te ao MƒÅori. Staff show a strong commitment to furthering their knowledge and confidence in the use of te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Leaders have identified that it is now timely for the service‚Äôs philosophy to be reviewed in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau. Consideration should be given to integrating the centre's identified learning outcomes in this revised document.</p><p>The team is improvement focused and uses internal evaluation to inform next steps for ongoing improvement. The team should undertake a deeper analysis of the information gathered and use this to make judgements about the effectiveness of the curriculum and teaching practice in regard to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The HPS team works collaboratively with hospital teams and acts as a strong advocate for the children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The association should update the performance management policy and appraisal procedure. They must also ensure that all staff are regularly and meaningfully appraised.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the service are for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>review the philosophy in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau, and ensure that valued learning outcomes are clearly identified in it</li>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te whare Manaaki completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found an area of non-compliance related to governance, management and administration. In order to address this:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association should ensure that all staff are appraised each year. <i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.]</i></p>
</li>
</ol><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>4 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
