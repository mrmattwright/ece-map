<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Te Akau &amp; Districts Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Enthusiastic parents work effectively together. They use their parenting and teaching skills to manage the operation of the centre and provide good quality education and care for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Akau &amp; Districts Playcentre is a parent cooperative located in the rural district of Te Akau, catering for 16 children from birth to school age, one morning a week from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm. The centre operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA) who provides governance, management and educational support. The WPA communicates effectively with centre members and supports them as educators of their children.</p><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s last review in 2006, the playcentre has responded positively in addressing the recommendations in this report. Currently the centre is operating under a transitional licence. Parents have made significant progress in working towards completing outstanding issues resulting from the Ministry of Education relicensing visit. An experienced and valued centre support worker (CWS) is employed by the association to assist the centre to meet administration and regulatory requirements.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy aims to achieve &lsquo;happy children and parents having fun, working and learning together, to become confident and competent individuals&rsquo;.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Waikato Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families experience a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. Children learn and play in a positive, safe environment where they feel they have a place. Parents know their own and other children well and are responsive to their strengths and interests. They share information and learning through wall displays and end of session evaluations. The programme provides opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>child-initiated learning experiences that allow children to choose their own activities from a range of good quality resources</li>
<li>positive social opportunities for children to learn about cooperating with others</li>
<li>oral language, literacy and mathematical experiences through meaningful play</li>
<li>exploration in the outdoor environment</li>
<li>successful transition to the adjacent school supported by positive relationships between the centre and school.</li>
</ul><p>Parents work effectively together and share responsibility for the education programme and administration of the centre. They are encouraged by experienced members to develop their leadership skills by taking on management roles and responsibilities, and participating in centre decision making. Parents have established a warm caring culture in which children are affirmed and their successes celebrated. Relationships among parents are based on mutual respect with the focus on catering for the child and their families.</p><p>Members are involved in professional development provided by the Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA) in self review and assessment practices to support and enhance their knowledge and skills. There are links to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> (the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum) that are evident in planning and some learning stories. Models of individual children&rsquo;s portfolios show children&rsquo;s learning and participation in the programme.</p><p>ERO agrees with the priorities identified by the centre. Parents:</p><ul>
<li>are conscious that they need to more consistently record children&rsquo;s learning and strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>have identified the Te Ao M&#257;ori dimension needs to incorporate te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the curriculum. This was identified after a reflective centre self review process.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Akau &amp; Districts Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>11 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
