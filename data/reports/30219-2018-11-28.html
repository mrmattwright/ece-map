</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Abbey’s Place is a privately owned education and care service located in the Tauranga suburb of Brookfield. The service is licensed for up to 47 children, including a maximum of 10 under the age of two years. Centre organisation comprises two separate age-based settings for younger and older children. The roll of 45 includes 26 Māori children.</p><p>Through the philosophy management and teachers aim to provide a caring, safe and secure home-like setting where each member is entitled to respect and the best of care. The philosophy also promotes celebration of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa.</p><p>ERO’s July 2015 report identified next steps for programme planning, interactions with infants and toddlers and teacher appraisal. The centre has made significant progress in improving interactions, the environment and programme for infants and toddlers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre management implements responsive and sustainable practices that enable equitable opportunities for the participation of children and their families. Inclusion of all children and promotion of positive learning outcomes is central to decision making. Management and staff have developed productive partnerships within the local community, including iwi, schools and external agencies. Children and their whānau are affirmed for who they are and valued as members of the centre community.</p><p>Māori children are well supported to experience success as Māori. There are many opportunities for them to contribute and participate as tangata whenua. Tikanga and te reo Māori are embedded in teachers' practice and centre routines. There is a strong presence of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga that support children and whānau to develop a genuine sense of belonging.</p><p>Positive and nurturing relationships foster children’s trust and confidence. Children are encouraged to be independent, express their ideas and preferences. They confidently show leadership and make valued contributions to the programme. Teachers use a range of intentional strategies to support and fully engage children with additional learning needs. The emphasis on environmental sustainably provides children with meaningful opportunities to learn about the living world and how to care for it. All children experience a rich range of learning opportunities in the centre and wider community.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are viewed as capable and competent learners. They benefit from a culture of care in a small group setting. Key adults are responsive to individualised routines and children’s developing interests and successes. Transitions into and within the centre are well supported and responsive to children's readiness and needs.</p><p>Assessment for learning processes and practices are developing. Teachers maintain a good record of children's interests and participation in the programme. Further development is needed to more deliberately include individual children’s language, culture and identity. Documentation of continuity of learning overtime and the roles of parents and children in individual assessment and planning needs strengthening.</p><p>Centre leaders effectively build teachers' capability within the service to promote positive learning outcomes for all children. Leadership is collaborative and emergent leadership is encouraged among teachers, children and parents. Management and teachers engage in professional learning and discussion related to current trends in education and legislation. Beginning teachers benefit from focused and ongoing mentoring and coaching.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Some progress has been made in aligning the appraisal process to the new teaching code and standards. Further development of the appraisal process needs to include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formal observations of teacher’s practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quality goals that enable teachers to inquire into, and improve their practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate appraisal for the centre manager that takes account of the professional leadership role and teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Review of the centre philosophy is needed to ensure alignment to <em>Te Whāriki</em> 2017 and to clearly reflect centre priorities relating to Treaty-based and sustainable practices.</p><p>Recent professional learning and development has affirmed the need to strengthen strategic planning. This should now include more specific and measurable goals, alignment to teachers’ appraisal and self review for improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>28 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2  Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
