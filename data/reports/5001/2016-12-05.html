</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Anne West Kindergarten is licensed for up to 30 children between two and five years of age. It provides sessions for children that are similar to school hours. The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy is founded on respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi and values te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori. Most of the children enrolled in the kindergarten have MƒÅori heritage and many whakapapa to the five iwi of Muriwhenua.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of three in the Far North governed by the Kaitaia and District Kindergarten Association. A manager oversees kindergarten operations and reports regularly to a board that is responsible for the strategic direction of the association. A senior teacher was appointed in 2015 to support professional learning and the ongoing improvement of teaching practices. An experienced head teacher leads a team that includes qualified teachers and a part-time administrator.</p><p>Positive features identified in ERO‚Äôs 2009 and 2013 reports have been sustained. These include warm, respectful relationships and a programme that is responsive to children's interests and celebrates meaningful bicultural experiences. Teachers have considered how to increase complex child-directed learning. The outdoor environment has been enhanced by a natural 'Fallen Forest' that provides children with good opportunities for physical play and challenge.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three kindergarten reviews in the Kaitaia and District Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is highly evident in practice. Whanaungatanga and manaakitanga provide a strong foundation for children‚Äôs wellbeing and sense of belonging. Children are becoming more knowledgeable about MƒÅori protocol, including karakia and waiata. A pepeha expresses the story of the kindergarten's place in the local area. Te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori is an authentic part of the kindergarten‚Äôs programme. Tamariki MƒÅori have many opportunities to see and hear their language and culture being valued and respected.</p><p>Children's engagement in the programme is supported by a calm and inclusive tone. They develop friendships and capably manage their relationships with teachers and other children. Children learn to negotiate and ask questions and this helps them to direct their own learning. They have rich conversations and share their ideas with others. Flexible routines promote uninterrupted and collaborative learning.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their whƒÅnau. They value children's knowledge, listen carefully and provide resources to support children's exploration and learning. Teachers' skilful, intentional conversations with children contribute to the development of their oral language. Teaching practices empower children to investigate and inquire. A focus on environmentally sustainable approaches and providing opportunities for children to assess and manage risk underpin the programme. Teachers are highly effective in supporting children to grow as confident and independent learners.</p><p>The programme is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and reflects the concept of ako. Children and teachers share information and ideas, learn alongside each other and work together to determine the curriculum. Teachers value the information that whƒÅnau share about children's home and community experiences.</p><p>There are high quality and extensive systems for assessing, planning for, and evaluating children‚Äôs learning. Children's progress over time is analysed well and celebrated in attractively presented kupenga (individual learning records) that parents can access online. A mihi haerenga (leaving story) provides very useful information about children's interests and strengths as they transition to school.</p><p>The head teacher promotes high expectations and there is a culture of professionalism in all aspects of kindergarten operations. Regular professional learning and development helps teachers to extend their skills and knowledge. The appraisal system is well used by teachers to help them reflect on progress towards their individual goals. A clear vision for future improvement is supported by long-term and annual goals and well documented internal evaluation. Teachers value the support provided by the senior teacher to improve programmes and practices.</p><p>Management policies and processes are well established. The association‚Äôs strategic plan focuses on making decisions to improve learning outcomes for children, which include investing in upgrading property and environments. The board is using the New Zealand School Trustees Association's tool, <em>Haut≈´: MƒÅori Cultural Responsiveness Self Review tool for Boards of Trustees</em> to review how well the association is meeting its commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on existing high quality practices teachers agree they could:</p><ul>
<li>refine programme documentation to focus on the aspects that are most meaningful for and valued by whƒÅnau</li>
<li>improve the evaluation of programme and strategic goals to clearly identify positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The board and manager agree to:</p><ul>
<li>improve the policy and procedures for managing staff competency and performance</li>
<li>develop and implement an action plan to progress the association‚Äôs commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi</li>
<li>evaluate progress towards meeting the association's strategic goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Anne West Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. The board and manager should ensure the practices and procedures for police vetting meet the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children's Act</em>.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7A.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Anne West Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
