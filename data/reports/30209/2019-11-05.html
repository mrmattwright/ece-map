</table><p>Piki Te Ora&nbsp;is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Piki Te Ora operates from the children's ward of Hawke's Bay Hospital. The service is operated by a team of four Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) and the playroom is licensed by the Ministry of Education to cater for 11 children under primary school entry age, including seven aged up to two years.</p><p>Hospital Play Specialists are part of multidisciplinary teams (MDT) that support children's development, learning and emotional wellbeing while they are hospitalised. They also contribute to the wider aspects of paediatric care, providing support at bed sides, for hospitalised children and their family and wh&#257;nau members. All four HPS are registered teachers. The Service Director for Community Woman and Children has oversight of the management and operation of Piki Te Ora. The HPS team leader oversees day-to-day management of the service.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the importance of building partnerships with families and wh&#257;nau, celebrating diversity, and acknowledging Te Tiriti o Waitangi, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> and <em>Te Whare Tapawh&#257;.</em></p><p>The May 2016 ERO evaluation found that the service needed to improve in areas of governance and management, internal evaluation, assessment and the appraisal process. Progress has been made to address these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hospital Play Specialists adopt respectful and inclusive practices to quickly establish rapport with children, families and wh&#257;nau. Whakawhanaungatanga is highly valued to promote a sense of wellbeing within the hospital environment. Children and wh&#257;nau respond positively to the sensitive and attentive care provided by the HPS. They demonstrate secure and trusting relationships.</p><p>Children and wh&#257;nau benefit from the calm, natural outdoor play environment that provides a welcoming inclusive space to explore and relax. The playroom has been refreshed to reflect the dual heritages of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Appropriate resourcing for younger children has been sought to promote active and physical movement as required. HPS provide relevant activities to promote creativity, sensory play and problem solving. Children are well supported to engage in medical play to prepare them for medical procedures to reduce anxiety.</p><p>The service is committed to embedding te ao M&#257;ori concepts, tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori into children's learning experiences. HPS work collaboratively with wh&#257;nau to provide culturally responsive support for their children. The Hawke&rsquo;s Bay District Health Board (DHB) M&#257;ori Health Unit provides ongoing support as needed. Leaders have identified the need to improve the use of te reo M&#257;ori to further support M&#257;ori children's success.</p><p>A strength-based approach to assessment supports HPS to identify children&rsquo;s interests, abilities and dispositions. Responsive and meaningful learning opportunities are provided at children's bedsides and in the playroom. Families' cultures, languages and identities are valued and acknowledged. HPS have access to external support to strengthen their understanding of Pacific cultures. Supporting children to make choices about their learning and making this more visible within documentation continues to be a strategic focus.</p><p>Hospital Play Specialists advocate and empower wh&#257;nau and children as the experts of their own wellbeing to contribute to the development of a hospital-based curriculum. They work collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team to provide appropriate support that is responsive to the individual needs of each child and their family.</p><p>The DHB and the service have strengthened systems and processes to support consistent understanding and implementation of practice linked to legislative requirements of the play service. Several strategic projects have been successfully implemented to improve outcomes for children and wh&#257;nau. HPS work collaboratively to improve the quality of the service. To further support ongoing improvement in practice, a priority is to embed the new appraisal process for HPS, linked to the <i>Standards for the Teaching Profession</i>.</p><p>Some work has been undertaken to improve leaders&rsquo; understanding of internal evaluation. Parent and wh&#257;nau views are regularly sought and responded to. Further developing effective evaluation for improvement should support the team to report against achieving strategic goals, identify priorities for improvement and provide assurance that accountabilities have been met at governance level.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>embed the HPS appraisal process</li>
<li>strengthen the understanding and use of evaluation by HPS to improve outcomes for children and families</li>
<li>extend the use of te reo M&#257;ori to further strengthen inclusive practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piki Te Ora completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p>Central Region</p><p>5 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><i>Pou Whakahaere</i>&ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li><i>Pou &#256;rahi</i>&ndash; how leadership is enacted to contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li><i>M&#257;tauranga</i>&ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li><i>Tikanga whakaako</i>&ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity, contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of<i>arotake</i>&ndash; self review and of<i>whanaungatanga</i>&ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to two years of age.</p><p><i>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</i></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p></html>
