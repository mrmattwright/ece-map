</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids at Play Childcare Centre is a long established early childhood service located in Mt Eden, Auckland. It operates as a not-for-profit incorporated society. The management committee, made up from elected parents and the centre manager, is the governing body for the centre. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 42 children, including up to 12 under two years of age.</p><p>Seven qualified teachers and additional support staff work with age related groups of children. Infants and toddlers have their own large indoor and outdoor play areas and older children have several indoor and outdoor learning spaces. Several new teachers have been appointed in the last three years.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on the importance of the family and whƒÅnau involvement in children's learning. It includes a strong commitment to fostering an interactive, fun environment where children have positive learning experiences.</p><p>The 2015 ERO review identified many positive findings that continue to be present. The report recommended strengthening learning partnerships with parents, planning strategically towards the centre's vision and philosophy, and linking planning and assessment to better reflect current best practice in early education. Teachers have made positive progress in each of these areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are valued and respected learners. Teachers place high importance on play as a foundation for learning. Children learn at their own pace in the centre's large, calm and inclusive learning environments. Older children are involved in complex and sustained play. They engage in meaningful conversations with each other and with adults. Children trust teachers to be responsive and to encourage them in their learning.</p><p>Children make full use of the learning environment. The spacious outside play area is attractively set out and offers a good range of age-appropriate and interesting challenges. This environment helps children to develop their physical skills and social competencies. The indoor areas have some inviting spaces and displays that reflect the character of the centre. Early literacy and mathematics are integral parts of the programme. Teachers celebrate important cultural events with families and the environment shows some influence of children's culture.</p><p>Teachers are growing their bicultural practices and understanding of te ao MƒÅori and documenting these more explicitly. They are integrating more te reo MƒÅori into the programme, especially during mat time. Leaders are well placed to continue to grow the use and place of te reo MƒÅori me ≈çna tikanga into everyday common use.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for and nurtured. They form warm bonds with their prime caregiver and other teachers. They experience a range of opportunities that support their development and learning. Although the environment contains many good resources, teachers should increase the access infants and toddlers have to heuristic, natural, open-ended resources.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive of all children and their whƒÅnau. They listen to children respectfully. Teachers build positive partnerships with parents. They focus on developing quality teaching practices to support children's ongoing learning, wellbeing and development.</p><p>Well-considered planning and assessment practices guide relevant programmes for children. Planning approaches are collaborative and flexible, allowing teachers to respond to children's interests and to cater for diverse learning needs. Leaders intend to focus more on individual planning to support older children to develop their critical thinking skills.</p><p>Children's learning stories contain good records of their participation in the programme. They are available on-line to parents and whƒÅnau and are linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. More parents are using the on-line portal to share children's learning at home with teachers.</p><p>The centre manager and lead teachers provide effective leadership. Annual appraisal supports teachers and leaders to reflect on the quality of teaching practice against centre strategic goals and the professional teaching standards. These appraisals inform professional development decisions aligned to teachers' specific interests and promote valued outcomes for children.</p><p>The vision of the society management committee provides a clear direction for the centre. Extensive governance policies and practices outline operations and promote adherence to regulations. The committee has formalised self-review practices against strategic planning and is strengthening internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing and evaluating the centre philosophy in line with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and other teaching philosophies currently being implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritising teacher development and programme implementation within the centre's strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing the centre's self-review into more robust internal evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids at Play Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids at Play Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>8 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
