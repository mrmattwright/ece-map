</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Inglewood Playcentre is one of 17 parent led services governed under the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association) umbrella. The governance of these centres has recently reverted to a structure where all centre representatives contribute to association decisions and priorities. A large and active committee of parents is responsible for the centre‚Äôs operation and administration.</p><p>Areas for review and development noted in the November 2010 ERO review included strengthening the use of te reo MƒÅori, improved analysis of self review, and that association reports should provide more detailed feedback and next development steps to members. The committee and centre members continue to develop confidence in their use of te reo MƒÅori and self-review practices. The association still needs to improve its support for centre members.</p><p>Since the November 2010 ERO Review, Inglewood Playcentre offers three weekly sessions, to better meet the needs of children and families. Significant changes to the learning environment have enhanced children‚Äôs opportunities to explore, investigate and create.</p><p>Inglewood Playcentre is a cooperative where parents are involved in all aspects of decision making. A significant number of centre members accept management roles and responsibilities and undertake the necessary training to develop their skills.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Playcentre philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children‚Äôs needs, interests and strengths guide planning and the implementation of the child-initiated curriculum.</p><p>Individuals play and learn in a supportive and inclusive environment. Adults are warm and responsive to children. High ratios of adults ensure children‚Äôs needs are promptly met. Children‚Äôs talk is consistently encouraged, accepted and respected. Their language development and independence is fostered.</p><p>Children aged under two are well catered for. Infants and toddlers experience responsive nurturing from adults at the centre. Centre members are available to babies and young children, supporting them in their learning and encouraging them in problem solving efforts and mastery of their own physical development.</p><p>Assessment, in the form of learning stories, is written by the child‚Äôs parent or other centre members providing multiple views of each learner. Strong links are made to the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>. Attractive individual portfolios contain records of learning, providing opportunities for children to revisit past experiences and rekindle interest. Children‚Äôs progress is celebrated. Centre members gather regularly to further develop their knowledge about current early childhood assessment practice.</p><p>The development of literacy, numeracy and science concepts are integrated into the child-centred programme. Children‚Äôs growing appreciation of word and number, and understanding of the natural world occurs through play. Children participate in farewell celebrations when they leave playcentre and parents are supported to become involved in their child‚Äôs transition to school.</p><p>Centre members actively support children‚Äôs connection with their language, culture and identity. Children demonstrate familiarity with karakia kai and some greetings and phrases in te reo MƒÅori. Centre members receive support from Puriri Whakamaru o Taranaki, the association MƒÅori representative, to gain further understanding of te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>Leadership is well distributed to an increasing number of parent educators according to their interests and strengths. Centre members work collaboratively as a team to create a relaxed and harmonious atmosphere. They demonstrate an enthusiastic commitment to ongoing professional development, enhancing teaching and learning.</p><p>Regular visits by association personnel provide advice and guidance. Positive relationships between the playcentre and those in support roles are evident. The association also offers opportunities for parents to train in playcentre early childhood education courses. Extending and improving the support the association offers to playcentres is an important next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified, and ERO agrees, that the following areas require strengthening and developing:</p><ul>
<li>te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori, and providing an environment that reflects New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage</li>
<li>self review to more clearly show the impact of adults' practices and learning on outcomes for children</li>
<li>strategic goals that focus on teaching and learning</li>
<li>defined strategies to support children‚Äôs transition to school, including connection between playcentre and school curriculums, and sharing useful information between centre and school to support continuity in their learning.</li>
</ul><p>The association would benefit from external support to strengthen and improve its understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>annual and strategic planning that better informs priorities for teaching and learning</li>
<li>relevant approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>fostering opportunities for MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau to have success as MƒÅori</li>
<li>supporting members' understanding of teaching and learning, and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>current approaches to self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Inglewood Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Inglewood Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>13 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
