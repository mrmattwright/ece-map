<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Paremata Kindergarten is a well-established centre situated on the southern side of the Pauatahanui inlet and is licensed for 30 children each day.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p>
<p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p>
<p>All teachers are qualified and registered at Paremata Kindergarten. Some have many years experience at the kindergarten, including the head teacher.</p>
<p>The well-enacted philosophy emphasises the importance of partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau to support children‚Äôs learning within an environment that promotes discovery, sustainability and respect.</p>
<p>Since the July 2012 ERO report, the centre has made good progress in addressing areas of practice in need of improvement. Other positive developments include enhancements to the physical environment. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergarten‚Äôs annual plans with the association‚Äôs strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in WhƒÅnau Manaaki Kindergartens.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children and teachers enjoy positive relationships. They confidently work with their peers or by themselves for sustained periods. Children are comfortable to seek challenges in their learning. Many different literacy and numeracy experiences are well integrated within the programme.</p>
<p>Children respond positively to the teachers‚Äô view of them as capable and competent learners. Teachers use practices and have purposeful interactions to effectively build on children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving. They encourage children to make decisions about their learning. There is proactive support for developing social competence.</p>
<p>Transition-to-school links are well established that assist children and their families as they move on. There are many ways information is shared with parents about aspects of the programme.</p>
<p>Portfolios are used well to record children‚Äôs participation and progress in a range of contexts. Assessment practices provide parents and whƒÅnau with a way of contributing to their child‚Äôs learning. Information from individuals and groups of children is used to plan the programme. Recent development is supporting teachers to identify and promote continuity in learning. Enhancements to practice are ongoing and include plans to involve children more in setting their own learning goals.</p>
<p>Teachers put significant work into documenting children‚Äôs interests and the current kindergarten planning focus. These records show children‚Äôs active involvement and learning across many aspects of the programme, and their participation in the local community.</p>
<p>Children with additional needs are positively supported and well catered for, in the inclusive programme.</p>
<p>Self review is a well-established process. Teachers are focused on improvement and they have built a strong culture of reflection. With the purposeful support of the senior teacher, they continue to explore ways to build on these inquiry practices.</p>
<p>The 2012 ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. This continues to require development. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, has the potential to improve processes to better support the development of teachers and leaders. This includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p>
<p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p>
<p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te¬†Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning. Paremata Kindergarten‚Äôs curriculum is increasingly responsive to learners to promote successful outcomes for all.</p>
<p>Children have some opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they need to build their capability to be responsive to MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture, language, and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka¬†Hikitia: Accelerating Success</em> <em>2013 - 2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners.</em></p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps. They will:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to improve aspects of assessment</li>
<li>extend the bicultural curriculum for all learners</li>
<li>promote ways for MƒÅori to achieve success as MƒÅori, and Pacific learners to achieve success as Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<p>The senior management team of He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and the senior teacher. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paremata Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Paremata Kindergarten will be in three years.</p>
<p>Joyce Gebbie Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p>
<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
