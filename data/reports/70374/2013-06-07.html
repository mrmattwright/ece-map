</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC St Martins is owned and administered by Kidicorp Education and Care Centres. The centre provides all day education and care for children from birth to school age in separate nursery and preschool areas. The centre is licensed for a maximum of 40 children. Teachers are proud of their small family-like environment.</p><p>The centre has had a stable teaching team for some time. A recent early childhood graduate began at the centre at the beginning of 2013. All teachers, except one in training, are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre suffered earthquake damage during the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, and was closed for three weeks. It is still awaiting repairs to its outside area. This is affecting the timing of planned redevelopment of the outdoor areas. Both indoor areas have been recently renovated.</p><p>Centre managers, staff and parents have recently reviewed the centre philosophy. It focuses on providing a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment where communication between whƒÅnau and staff is actively encouraged.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled at the centre. Teachers respond to their needs and interests. They provide good choices for children through the range of resources, and the way that they communicate with them. Children experience positive interactions with adults that successfully build their confidence and extend their social skills. They notice children, question and respond to them in ways that challenge and extend their learning.</p><p>In the nursery, children are well nurtured by warm and caring staff. There is a calm atmosphere as teachers respond sensitively to children‚Äôs actions. Babies and infants settle well. Routines are well communicated and respectful. Toddlers are confident and competent, and unafraid of approaching adults. Teachers acknowledge the need for interaction between siblings and provide opportunities for siblings in different parts of the centre to have time together.</p><p>Teachers are proactive in getting to know children and their families. They use a range of ways to include and involve them in the life of the centre. There are good links with home evident in the environment, including framed photographs of family members, and a display of a recent whƒÅnau afternoon tea event. The centre manager has recently held parent interviews and followed up with a written summary of the meeting. Parents are encouraged to contribute to the children‚Äôs profile books and do so through writing comments on learning stories, and providing photographs of family activities for children to revisit at the centre. They are able to participate in comprehensive surveys twice a year.</p><p>MƒÅori children are supported through the centre‚Äôs focus on actively involving families. There is informal discussion after enrolment about parents‚Äô aspirations for their children. Teachers provide some bicultural learning opportunities. One staff member is supporting others to develop in this area. This is a good model of tuakana teina as teachers learn with each other and alongside the children. Improving biculturalism has also been identified as one of the goals in the centre‚Äôs strategic plan.</p><p>Centre managers and staff are now involved in effective self review. A new process was used to undertake a comprehensive review of the centre‚Äôs philosophy. A strategic plan has now been developed with major reviews planned through to 2015.</p><p>Kidicorp and centre managers work together to provide clear direction for the teaching team. The Kidicorp management framework guides centre operations. Kidicorp managers are making good use of this framework to identify where improvements should occur. There are clear links between future planning, organisational self review, staff appraisal and professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kidicorp and centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to improve learning and teaching include:</p><ul>
<li>building on and extending the effective practices for the assessment of and planning for children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>continue to support staff to use the new self-review process so that it is used for all reviews, spontaneous as well as formal reviews</li>
<li>strengthen bicultural learning and practices in meaningful ways to further support success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori and to enrich the learning of all children in the heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
<li>continue to monitor the use of indoor and outdoor spaces to ensure the best use is made for children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC St Martins completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC St Martins will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>7 June 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
