</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Teviot Valley Educare helps children know they belong in the Teviot Valley Community. The centre is the only full-day early childhood service in Roxburgh and serves the wider rural community. Children play and learn in well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas. About a fifth of the families identify as MƒÅori. Some families travel long distances for their children to attend.</p><p>The experienced teachers provide care and education for up to 30 children from six months to school age. The centre is governed by an elected voluntary parent committee. The head teacher and office manager oversee the day-to-day operations of the centre.</p><p>ERO noted significant progress since the 2012 ERO report in the areas of governance, self review and programme planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The leaders and teachers have a shared vision for children at the centre. The concept of ako (learning together) is central to their approach. Teachers value the knowledge and experiences children and their families bring to the centre. The teachers are intentional in the way they recognise and respond to opportunities to extend children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>There is a wide range of worthwhile learning experiences for children to choose from. The experiences reflect what is important in children's lives and also expose them to new ideas and opportunities for deeper learning. For example:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>they visit parents' workplaces in the town, local orchards and farms and recreate these experiences through dramatic play and art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an annual beach trip for children and their families allows them to explore a very different environment from where they live.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from warm and trusting relationships with their teachers. They play and learn in a settled and calm atmosphere. Teachers help build children's sense of security by ensuring children know what is going to happen next. Routines are flexible and responsive to children's needs.</p><p>Teachers have built strong connections with families and the local community. They know about the diverse needs of different families and have made an inclusive place where families are welcome and their cultures are celebrated.</p><p>The teachers are committed to creating an environment where whƒÅnau MƒÅori know their culture is valued. This is evident in the way they:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>make efforts to find out what is important for whƒÅnau MƒÅori at the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage tuakana/teina relationships (older children helping younger children to learn)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have sought professional learning to increase their own knowledge and confidence in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use some te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia with the children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share cultural events such as celebrating MƒÅtariki, and preparing hangi with the children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for. Teachers have thought carefully about what works best for this age group. They focus on building trusting relationships and maintaining a calm and unhurried pace. Four-year olds enjoy a weekly session that helps build their leadership and extends them as they prepare for school. The centre maintains close connections with local schools.</p><p>Children's learning is supported by a programme based on all the strands of Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum. The planned programme includes many opportunities for children to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learn positive attitudes to healthy eating and being physically active</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be creative and expressive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn early literacy and mathematics concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in real-life activities such as gardening and cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make decisions and be self managing.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teachers have significantly strengthened the systems for individual and group planning since the last ERO report. They now better show what they intend children to learn and how children have made progress over time. It is important that they refine and embed these new systems. They should also explore how they can combine parents' knowledge with teachers' expertise to identify next steps for children's learning and the best ways to achieve these.</p><p>The leaders and centre administrator have good systems to ensure the smooth running of the centre. The leaders and teachers work well as a team. They are open to new ideas and focused on improvement. All team members are encouraged to contribute to the development of the centre. They have not been limited by the geographic isolation of Roxburgh and have been active in finding relevant professional development and networks to keep them up to date with current ideas.</p><p>The appraisal system is becoming a useful tool in strengthening teacher practice. There is scope to build in some common goals to support the centre's strategic direction. Targeted observations would give teachers feedback about what they are doing well to support children in their learning and what they could do better. The committee should have input into leadership aspects of the head teacher's appraisal.</p><p>The team members have improved their understanding and use of internal evaluation. This has led to improvements at the centre. Better choice and use of indicators would make the process even more valuable. Outcomes of internal evaluation should be reported to the committee to assure them how well the centre is supporting children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The committee has written guidelines to help members know their roles and responsibilities. They agree they need to help new members understand the importance of their governing role and should explore ways to do this. They have good oversight of the day-to-day operation of the centre and support the head teacher in her role.</p><p>A useful strategic plan sets out important priorities for the centre‚Äôs future. The committee should make more use of the strategic plan to drive its decision making. The committee minutes and head teacher's reports could be more clearly aligned to show the centre‚Äôs progress in achieving the vision and strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps are for teachers to embed and refine:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>systems for assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aspects of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The committee needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to grow its governance capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more carefully monitor progress and actions towards meeting the centre's vision and strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Teviot Valley Educare Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To meet the updated licensing criteria, centre management must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>document daily safety checks (HS12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review emergency procedures annually (HS7).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Teviot Valley Educare Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>18 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
