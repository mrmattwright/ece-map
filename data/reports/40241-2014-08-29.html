</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Hokowhitu is an all-day education and care centre located in urban Palmerston North. At the time of the March 2011 ERO review this service was one of two licensed centres. It is now amalgamated to one service in two buildings and is licensed for 56 children including 17 up to two years of age.</p><p>Separate areas are provided for children aged two to three and a half, and for those over three and a half years in one building. The second house caters for infants and toddlers aged up to two years. Currently there are 14 MƒÅori children on the roll.</p><p>In November 2011, Kidicorp took ownership of the service. Changes were made to improve the indoor and outdoor learning environments for children and adults. The newly appointed centre manager and teachers are supported by a regional manager, business manager and professional services.</p><p>The visiting teacher from professional services is responsible for monitoring the quality of the curriculum and supporting teachers‚Äô ongoing professional learning and growth. The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the service.</p><p>The overall centre and individual area philosophies underpin practice. Teachers have recently focused on strengthening bicultural awareness and assessment for learning documentation practices to enhance outcomes for children.</p><p>There is a satisfactory reporting history with ERO for the centre prior to the merging of the two licences.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has a positive organisational culture. Its approach to reviewing, with a focus on improvement, is positively influencing teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Children enthusiastically engage in spontaneous and planned experiences. Learning programmes are relevant and responsive to children‚Äôs interests and ideas. Infants and toddlers develop trusting relationships with key teachers.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is enhanced through positive interaction with caring adults who know them and their families well. The centre‚Äôs youngest children are effectively catered for by adults who encourage developing verbal language and recognise their cues and wishes. Early mathematics concepts occur for infants through enjoyable everyday experiences that encourage them to explore further.</p><p>Older children show confidence and high levels of independence. Teachers mostly allow children to extend their learning without interruption. Conversations challenge children‚Äôs thinking through questioning and exploring possibilities.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy is often integrated and part of children‚Äôs choices. Mathematical learning is enhanced through a range of opportunities to engage in games in which children can vary the level of challenge.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and affirming in their relationships with children. A positive tone is noticeable across the centre.</p><p>Staff work collaboratively to determine parents' aspirations and expectations. Learning and development are increasingly celebrated and shared between teachers and parents. A developing part of this process is the collection and sharing of assessment information with families through e-portfolios. This approach has the potential to further extend children‚Äôs learning and encourage parent input.</p><p>Staff are reviewing the use of te reo MƒÅori in their practice. One consequence is increased use of te reo MƒÅori in daily practice in most areas of the centre.</p><p>Managing change to strengthen centre practices is a focus for the newly appointed centre manager. She effectively leads review processes that assist centre developments and decision-making. Leadership is supportive and collaborative. Clear expectations for managing centre operations provide direction through well-developed systems and processes.</p><p>Developing systems for planned and spontaneous self review promote ongoing reflection and improvement. Managers support staff as they develop their evaluation capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Attention should be given to strengthening practice in relation to aspects of the centre‚Äôs philosophy statements. Managers and teachers should continue to develop and increase shared understanding of formal, in-depth, evidence-based self review to enhance decision-making. Further development should include:</p><ul>
<li>maintaining MƒÅori learners' connections to their cultural identity through increased inclusion of te ao MƒÅori in curriculum practices</li>
<li>inquiring into the effectiveness of formal programmes for older children to support their literacy and numeracy learning</li>
<li>enhancing assessment practices to guide future teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Hokowhitu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Hokowhitu will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>29 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
