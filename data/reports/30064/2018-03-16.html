</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Hillcrest is an all-day centre providing education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre has a designated area for the care of children up to two years of age, but operates overall as a mixed-age setting. The centre licence allows for a maximum of 40 children, at any one time, including up to 10 under the age of two years.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims for children to be confident, competent life-long learners and communicators, healthy in mind, body and spirit. Through the philosophy the centre promotes children's sense of belonging and seeks to unlock their potential in all areas. The centre endeavours to promote self-help skills and to encourage children to be active explorers and independent learners.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart organisation which is owned by the Wright Foundation, a Charitable Trust. BestStart provides comprehensive policy guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management. Professional guidance and development of staff is provided through appraisal which includes teacher inquiry, internal reviews such as the annual Quality Education and Care evaluation (QEC) and professional learning opportunities. The centre is supported by business and professional service managers, who work collaboratively with the centre manager. Management also supports the implementation of the company and centre's visions and strategic goals. Centre goals cover project work and inquiry learning, building on parent aspirations for their children, bicultural practice, resourcing in the under two year area and strengthening links into the community.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in October 2014, a head teacher has been appointed to assist the long -serving centre manager and to take particular responsibility for assessment and planning. Teachers have been engaged in professional learning and development to strengthen assessment and planning, and bicultural practice. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>BestStart provides effective governance for the centre. A key guiding document is the annual QEC, which drives a model of continual improvement. The QEC is a well-established aspect of self review that informs strategic and annual planning, identifies priorities for professional practice, centre operations and improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Leadership effectively promotes a culture of mutual respect and collaboration within the centre community. The long-serving centre manager has strong links to past and present families and whānau. She makes a deliberate commitment to utilising strengths of individual staff to provide optimum learning opportunities for children. Leaders and teachers have a shared commitment to the centre's philosophy, vision and goals. Through professional sharing, reflective practice and focused learning and development teachers are enhancing their individual and collective capability. Leaders and staff provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all children, including those with additional learning and development needs, which contributes to children's wellbeing and belonging. </p><p>The centre’s curriculum offers a broad range of learning experiences and is effective in promoting positive learning outcomes for all children. Programme design incorporates strands and principles of <em>Te Whariki,</em> and is increasingly seeking to respond to parent aspirations. These aspirations are informing planning and goals for individual children, and are reflected in summaries of learning in assessment documentation. Parent input to their child's learning and development is being further enhanced through the use of online sharing. Children demonstrate confidence and competence to lead their own learning and to make a contribution to the programme.</p><p>A special focus in this centre is the designated space for project work and inquiry learning available for children of all ages. A rostered teacher is available in this space to guide children's curiosity and support their exploration. Leaders recognise that to realise the full potential of this learning approach, it is important to strengthen teacher's knowledge and confidence in strategies to sustain complex learning. In addition, teachers need to better integrate appropriate levels of mathematics and literacy, and ensure appropriate resources are available to support children's initiatives.</p><p>The centre's overall environment supports children's learning through play. The outside play areas are spacious and invite children's exploration. These areas provide opportunities for physical challenge, construction and access to the natural world. The covered verandah extends children's play space in poor weather, and is well used for socio-dramatic play. Play areas are well resourced, especially for art and creativity.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from the freedom they have to move between play spaces. Strong tuakana/teina relationships where older and younger children can learn alongside and from one another are also beneficial. Very young children are well supported through a primary care approach that provides high levels of care. Regular face-to-face communication with parents allows for information sharing including care routines and learning. </p><p>Leaders and staff are strengthening bi-culturalism in the centre. They have worked in partnership with whānau to develop a pepeha appropriate to places of significance in the area. There is evidence of increasing use of te reo and tikanga Māori in authentic contexts, with a teacher fluent in te reo Māori taking a lead role.</p><p>Teaching practices effectively promote positive outcomes for all children. Respectful, mutually positive relationships amongst children, whānau and teachers are highly evident. The ERO review team observed many examples of good teaching practice with teachers participating in children’s play as partners. Teachers skilfully support the development of children's oral language and communication skills by thoughtful questioning. Children have freedom to make choices, explore, experiment and create with sustained periods of uninterrupted play.</p><p>Children and their families experience responsive and flexible transitions into and within the centre. Parents expressed confidence in the process of preparation for school. Children’s social competence, self-management skills and independence, along with literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leadership agree that areas of curriculum and teaching practice need further development. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen teacher’s knowledge of, and shared understanding about, project work and inquiry based learning</li>
<li>deepen teachers' understanding of culturally responsive operations and practice through an internal evaluation process using the principles in <em>Tātaiako</em> and <em>Te Whatū Pōkeka</em>.</li>
</ul><p>Managers recognise the need to strengthen the appraisal process by formalising observations of teacher practice, consistent with the Education Council expectations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Hillcrest completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Hillcrest will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>16 March 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
