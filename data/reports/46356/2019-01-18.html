</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ELCM - Takanini provides full-day education and care for 96 children, including up to 12 aged under two years. Enrolled children are from diverse cultural backgrounds and many speak more than one language. The teaching team reflects the cultures of the children and their families.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age into four rooms. There are separate outdoor areas for infants and toddlers, and pre-schoolers. The centre is located on the same site as Great Potentials, a holistic support service for families in the community.</p><p>The centre's newly established philosophy strongly reflects MƒÅori values with a focus on people and relationships. Teachers aim to take a holistic approach that empowers children, is respectful, and responsive to their individual needs.</p><p>The centre manager and two team leaders provide leadership for eight other qualified teachers, plus three in training and one unqualified. Leaders are looking to recruit two more teachers to complete the team.</p><p>ELCM - Takanini is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) and operates under its policies and management framework. An operations manager from CMKA visits regularly and provides leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The CMKA is in the process of reviewing its structures and operational framework.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the CMKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily into richly resourced, carefully considered play environments. They play well together in small groups or choose to explore on their own. There is a relaxed pace to the programme and a wide range of experiences that support children's wellbeing and engagement in their learning.</p><p>A consistent team of teachers and caregivers provides infants and toddlers with respectful and responsive care. Teachers are aware of the interests, abilities and communication styles of individual children and respond appropriately to them. They ensure children have easy access to resources and provide numerous opportunities for sensory play.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive of all children and know them well. They engage in warm conversations that support children's oral language development and celebrate their learning. They use effective strategies to support children's developing social competence.</p><p>Programme planning is based on teachers' observations of children at play. Children have opportunities to revisit their learning and play. The planning and evaluation framework continues to evolve as leaders and teachers reflect on the strengths and possibilities of a developing system, unique to their context.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori perspectives are very visible in the centre's philosophy. Leaders and teachers have worked collaboratively to establish a philosophy that is meaningful to their community. They are committed to strengthening their knowledge and use of te reo MƒÅori, and to deepening their knowledge of the MƒÅori culture.</p><p>Leaders are focused on progressing the vision and strategic thinking of the CMKA. They have developed an annual plan for the centre that links well to the organisation's strategic plan and is relevant to their context. A robust and consultative process drives the centre's internal evaluation. Relevant topics are chosen for review and the process results in positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is very well led. Centre leaders work collaboratively to effect change, ensuring the whole team is engaged in the process. Relevant professional learning, accessed through an external mentor, is promoting growth in teaching and leadership practices.</p><p>Well established CMKA management systems, policies and processes guide the early learning centre's practices. Embedding regular documented observations into the appraisal process would provide effective support for teachers' professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree their key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment documentation to more deeply reflect children's language, culture, identity, and their individual learning journey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening evaluation to show the impact of teaching practices on children's learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening teachers' shared understandings around implementing the newly developed centre philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>CMKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing consistent ongoing support for leaders and teachers that sustains leadership and improves teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, to identify priorities for learning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to increase the visibility of children's cultural identity and continuity of learning in their individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability and depth in internal evaluation across the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ELCM - Takanini completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ELCM - Takanini will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
