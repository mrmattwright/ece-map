</table><p>The centre is well placed to provide a sense of well being and belonging for children. Ongoing professional learning development for teachers should help them to more consistently promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Buttercups Early Learning Centre is a purpose built facility that opened in 2012 in the township of Pukekohe. It is a family owned and operated centre providing full-day education and care for up to 75 children from three months to school age.</p><p>The centre is led by the owners, one of whom is the manager. They share a history of education experience. The management team has developed policies and procedures which are regularly reviewed by teachers and parents from the centre. Professional development and support for staff is ongoing.</p><p>Children are catered for in three age-related groups. Each group has an outdoor area and a team leader who has responsibility for care routines and programme implementation. Most of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Teachers have taken inspiration from aspects of Reggio Emilia philosophy, particularly in terms of the environment and resources they provide throughout the centre. Teachers participate in ongoing professional learning development to strengthen the integration of Reggio Emilia approaches.</p><p>Teachers have a commitment to bicultural and multicultural practices. They continue to develop and celebrate these practices in the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle well in the centre environment. They have developed friendships, are happy and enjoy the resources and activities provided. They confidently engage in conversations with adults and each other.</p><p>The centre is welcoming to children and their parents. Teachers have developed deliberate strategies to support children with diverse needs. They could consider ways to further develop their questioning skills in order to extend children’s learning. Implementing flexible morning tea routines should provide opportunities for children to develop their self-help skills.</p><p>There are some good examples of teachers using te reo Māori, waiata and karakia. Resources with Māori themes are available to children. Teachers plan to further develop aspects of bicultural practice in their planning, assessment, and evaluation processes.</p><p>Teachers are making links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and are aligning their programme planning with Reggio Emilia principles and a project approach to learning. Centre managers have identified that staff are continuing to develop their understanding about Reggio Emilia philosophy. Ongoing reviews of play areas and teaching practices should help them to better reflect this philosophy.</p><p>Teachers identify children’s individual interests and incorporate both children’s and parents’ voice in programme planning. Teachers’ approach to assessment is becoming more focussed on children’s knowledge. Managers recognise the need for teachers to build their capacity to integrate individual interests into programme plans and to improve the quality of programme evaluations.</p><p>Whānau get good information from the centre. Feedback from parents shows that they appreciate opportunities for children to participate in excursions and learn about different cultures. Parents are also positive about the ways children’s relationships and people skills have developed.</p><p>While parents appreciate the transition to school programme, teachers should review the effectiveness of formal literacy and numeracy programmes and consider other approaches that could provide more authentic learning contexts for children.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The owners and assistant manager work collaboratively and have a shared vision for the centre. They have established thorough systems and documentation that supports strategic planning and goal setting. Centre documents provide a useful foundation for strengthening self review. The centre is making good use of Ministry of Education resources to support their ongoing self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and manager agree that the next steps for the centre should include:</p><ul>
<li>an on-going review of the philosophy, strategic planning and bicultural practices</li>
<li>further developing the transition to school programme, and the quality of teachers’ interactions with children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Buttercups Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Buttercups Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Dale Bailey<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Northern Region</p><p>10 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
