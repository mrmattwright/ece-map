</table><p>Taulama Home-Based ECE 2¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taulama Home-Based ECE 2 is one of seven home-based education and care networks owned by Kaliloa Education Limited. This network is licensed for up to 50 children, including a maximum of 35 under two years of age. Most of the children are Tongan. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. This is the network's first ERO review.</p><p>A manager and supervisor works closely with the coordinators to support educators qualified to plan educational programmes based on children's interests, and to monitor health and safety requirements.</p><p>Key aspects of the service's philosophy are to provide a culturally responsive curriculum based on the Tongan concept of vƒÅ, respectful relationships and connectedness, and maintaining Tongan language and culture.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Coordinators are continuing to build educators' knowledge and understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, through coaching, modelling and workshops. Educators are well supported to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>foster children's dispositions and self-management skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a programme that is meaningful for children under two years of age.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Educators integrate Tongan language and cultural practices well through the curriculum. They are continuing to develop an understanding of te ao MƒÅori perspectives. Coordinators should continue to build educators' understanding of children as leaders of their learning.</p><p>Coordinators regularly observe children's experiences to build continuity in their learning and capture their progress and development in learning stories. Parents have many opportunities to contribute to these records. Online portals and weekly news video clips provide effective ways of communicating with educators and parents.</p><p>Coordinators use internal evaluation to inform ongoing improvement. Internal evaluation has identified the need to continue developing a curriculum that recognises the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua. Leaders recognise that transitions to school processes need to be strengthened.</p><p>The implementation of the service philosophy, vision and strategic direction is guided by clearly defined roles of governance and management of the service. Leaders purposefully build the capabilities and skills of all educators and staff through targeted professional development. There is a robust induction process for new educators. A relevant appraisal process is in place. It would be useful to develop an appraisal policy to clearly guide the process.</p><p>Effective management and leadership support service operations. There is a framework of policies and procedures in place. Internal evaluation is well understood and used to inform continuous improvement. Leaders agree that they should enhance internal evaluation processes and document evaluation findings and related actions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enhance the service's strategic planning by refining and deepening internal evaluation at all levels of service operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build educators' understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and enable children to be leaders of their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taulama Home-Based ECE 2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>13 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
