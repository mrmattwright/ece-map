</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mini Miracles Educare - Pukekohe Kindy is a privately owned centre providing all-day education and care for children from two years to school age. The centre was purchased by the current owner in May 2017, and is one of four under the same ownership. It is licensed for 29 children over two years of age. The current roll is 33, including seven children who identify as Māori.</p><p>The owner/director retains responsibility for governance matters, including employment, financial and property management, setting the strategic direction, and a policy framework to meet legislative requirements. She is supported by a regional manager who has responsibility for professional leadership. The on-site supervisor was a teacher in the centre prior to the change of ownership and was appointed to her position in July 2017. She has responsibility for day-to-day operations including planning and assessment. The remaining teachers are new to the centre, and all qualified in early childhood education.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the provision of family-like environments and the establishment of genuine relationships between teachers, children and their families. The centre seeks to build links with their wider community.</p><p>The centre responded positively to recommendations in the 2014 ERO report. Self-review processes have been strengthened with both planned and spontaneous reviews focused on centre improvement. Planning and assessment are now responsive to children's individual learning dispositions.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A strength of the centre is the welcoming, genuine, sensitive relationships amongst teachers, children and parents. The ERO team observed highly engaged, settled and happy children, who are able to initiate their own learning, and have extended periods of uninterrupted play to develop sustained and complex learning. Familiar and purposeful routines support children to develop social competencies and build friendships. Shared celebrations foster children's sense of worth and belonging. The inclusive centre culture welcomes children who have additional learning and development needs, and teachers provide well-considered support for them and their families. Teachers recognise the need to further empower children of Pacific origin who are English language learners. Children are affirmed and supported to become confident and competent learners, within family-like environments.</p><p>The curriculum provides a rich range of learning opportunities to promote positive outcomes for all children. Teacher planning is closely linked to children’s current interests and strengths, and parent's aspirations. These aspirations are sought, respected and displayed. There are frequent examples of intentional teaching, when teachers make deliberate links to children's family and prior learning experiences. Teachers prepare individual assessment portfolios which are increasingly shared on-line. Children's play and exploration is well supported by appropriate resourcing of such areas as physical challenge, construction, sand/water play, art and creativity. Their learning experiences are further extended by natural world experiences including visits to the community. Children benefit from well-integrated literacy and mathematics learning opportunities. Children and their families are well supported prior to transition to school with reciprocal school visits. Aspects of practice related to the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em> curriculum and success for Māori children remain areas for further development by the new owners.</p><p>The supervisor and teachers recognise the importance of further strengthening the centre's culturally responsive practices and operations. The responsive and mutually respectful relationships amongst teachers, children and their whānau provide a strong foundation for this next step. Each child's pepeha is developed and displayed, and there are deliberate actions to increase all children's awareness of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. <em>Te Whāriki</em> 2017 curriculum provides the expectations for a stronger local curriculum which should enhance success for Māori children.</p><p>The recently appointed supervisor is successfully building relational trust with the regional manager, teaching team and parent community. The teaching team demonstrates mutual trust and collaboration as it works together constructively to plan and deliver the curriculum. Teachers appreciate the mentoring role of the supervisor as she assists them to develop their own professional practice. Reflective practice is being encouraged through teaching as inquiry and internal evaluation processes. Sound leadership is building capability within the centre to promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The new owner/director has developed a shared philosophy and the expectation to build parent partnerships and improved learning outcomes for children. The governance and centre support structures are at the consolidation stage. It is now important to formalise the professional development programme and appraisal processes for the supervisor and regional manager and to align these with the strategic plan and current requirements of the Education Council. These steps are necessary to support sustainability and the ongoing improvement of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner/director and ERO agree on the importance of strengthening quality assurance processes so she can be assured that professional practice and centre operations are consistently enhancing educational outcomes for all children. The continued strengthening of culturally responsive practice should be included in these regular reports. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mini Miracles Educare - Pukekohe Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mini Miracles Educare - Pukekohe Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>31 January 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services.</a> <em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
