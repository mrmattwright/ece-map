<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Oxford Playcentre is one of 49 centres that operate under the Canterbury Playcentre Association. This centre opens for two morning sessions each week. Supervision of the sessions is provided by an employed coordinator. Parents also remain at the centre during sessions and assist in running the programmes.</p><p align="left">The centre has made good progress since the June 2008 ERO review with assessment, self review and increasing parent involvement with children in the programme.</p><p align="left">The centre fosters an inclusive and supportive culture in which children&rsquo;s interests are supported and extended in a relaxed and enjoyable environment.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this centre are:</p><ul>
<li>children being supported to increase their independence</li>
<li>a high level of parent participation and contribution</li>
<li>the shared understanding of experiences and opportunities that most effectively support children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO, the coordinator and centre parents agree that the next steps for continuing improvement are to extend aspects of assessment, planning and self review.</p><h3 align="left">Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Oxford Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Oxford Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Programme</h5><p align="left">Children benefit from the child-led programme that is developed from and focuses on extending their interests. There is an appropriate mix of group and individual learning experiences. Parents and the coordinator have a shared understanding of their centre&rsquo;s philosophy which is evident in the programme in action.</p><p align="left">Children are supported to develop independence in their learning and self-care tasks. The programme also provides for periods of uninterrupted play where children are supported to sustain their attention in activities.</p><p align="left">The children&rsquo;s profile books show a good record of children&rsquo;s participation in the centre programme and aspects of the learning that has occurred.</p><h5>Environment</h5><p align="left">The indoor and outdoor areas are spacious, well resourced and well maintained.</p><p align="left">The outdoor environment is interesting and varied. It is inviting for children and provides many opportunities for them to explore and make discoveries. There is a range of equipment that provides physical challenges and is well used by children to extend their skills and build confidence.</p><p align="left">Parents are guided in their teaching roles during sessions through wall displays of useful information about programme objectives and ways to assist children&rsquo;s engagement.</p><h5>Interactions</h5><p align="left">Relationships among children and between adults and children are positive and friendly. On the day of the ERO review, adults were actively and continually involved with children. They were affirming of children&rsquo;s choices and responsive to them as the children engaged in their chosen activities.</p><p align="left">Language interactions between adults and children are varied and supportive of children&rsquo;s play and language development. Some adults make effective use of questions and prompts to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and exploration.</p><p align="left">The adults provide clear and consistent expectations that are helpful to children in developing their social skills.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The coordinator and parents have made good progress in noticing and recording children&rsquo;s interests and involvement in the programme. The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue developing skills in identifying the learning that is occurring for children</li>
<li>more clearly respond to the next steps for children&rsquo;s learning including planning learning experiences to address these</li>
<li>make better use of information about children&rsquo;s learning and the quality of teaching in reviews of programme effectiveness.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Oxford Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</ul><p align="left">ERO, the coordinator and centre parents agree that the next steps for continuing improvement are to extend aspects of assessment, planning and self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
