</table><p>Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 1¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Significant work is required by leaders and teachers to better understand and implement a curriculum that is consistent with the prescribed curriculum framework, as outlined in <em>the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Services 2008</em>. Children would benefit from targeted improvements to teacher practice, particularly relating to child-led learning, social competence support, and planning and assessment practices that reflect the early childhood curriculum <span lang="mi"><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></span>.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 1 is situated in Taita, Lower Hutt and provides education and care for children from three years to school age. The privately-owned service is licensed for 50 children aged over two years. Six children identify as MƒÅori and six as Pacific.</p><p>The service is one of two Life-Start centres. The Cottage (Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 2), located on a different site, caters to infants and toddlers. The two centres share a philosophy, that emphasises Christian values and equitable provision for families.</p><p>Management and leadership roles have recently been restructured. A centre manager now guides teaching and learning in both centres. The owner supports with administration and finance, and oversight of centre systems and professional learning. Teachers represent a diverse range of cultures and experience. Most are qualified.</p><p>The March 2017 ERO report identified a number of areas requiring development. These included: improving culturally responsive practices; appraisal; relationships with local schools; internal evaluation; and assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Some progress is evident, particularly in building internal evaluation practice and appraisal.</p><p>This review was one of two in Life-Start Early Learning Centres Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm relationships with their teachers. They benefit from regular local excursions, including swimming lessons. <span lang="mi">Te reo MƒÅori</span> and Pacific languages are heard regularly, supporting the oral language and sense of belonging for MƒÅori and Pacific children. There are well-considered processes in place for transitioning children and their families into the service.</p><p>The programme and teaching practice are of insufficient quality to meet requirements. Fostering children‚Äôs social competencies and engaging them in focused, sustained play is required. At times, resources and opportunities for children to make choices are unnecessarily limited. To promote positive outcomes for children, leaders and teachers should develop and implement a curriculum that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reflects of the principles, strands and the intent of the early childhood curriculum, <span lang="mi"><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrates an understanding of high quality early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offers children more opportunities for creativity and self-challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develops children's social competence through positive and consistent practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children have not benefitted from regular assessment, planning and evaluation of their learning. Teachers require support to understand and implement effective assessment processes. Areas for immediate improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing and monitoring the frequency of assessments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending children's learning in a wide range of areas, across the breadth of <span lang="mi"><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focusing teaching on following children's interests, and adding complexity over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning assessments with the strategies and areas of significant learning set out in the individual education plans (IEPs) of children with diverse learning needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring children have opportunities to revisit documentation of their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have been attentive to parent aspirations around school readiness and literacy and numeracy learning. A priority is for teachers to build a current understanding around effective and appropriate strategies in this area. This would equip them to offer parents an up-to-date understanding of what works best for children. Opportunities to engage with literacy and numeracy should be integrated meaningfully into play-based contexts, driven by children‚Äôs interests, rather than in formalised programmes and adult-directed activities. This would better prepare children for school learning.</p><p>Targeted strategies that support the success of MƒÅori children are in the early stages of development. A knowledgeable staff member has been appointed to lead professional learning and improve practice in this area. Leaders and teachers should ensure that whƒÅnau MƒÅori are central to decisions around these practices.</p><p>Leaders actively find ways to build on the expertise and interests of teachers and develop leadership across the Life-Start centres. Appraisal processes are used to encourage teachers to research and reflect on their practice. A next step is for staff to focus their professional learning on current research around learning through play, school readiness, and social competence support strategies.</p><p>Recently restructured leadership roles are currently being embedded. Leadership demonstrates a good understanding of internal evaluation. A next step is to share this knowledge and build practices across the teaching team and use internal evaluation to promote improvements for children. Leaders need to better streamline processes and prioritise developments, to ensure improvements in key areas.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve outcomes for children, leaders and teachers should urgently develop practices in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building a curriculum that is child-led and more strongly responsive to their interests and ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing understandings and practices around appropriate literacy and numeracy teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent and effective social competence support strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing regular, high-quality assessment, planning and evaluation for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and recording outcomes of IEPs for children with diverse learning needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, leaders should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding the newly developed leadership structure and roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing understanding and capability in using internal evaluation for improvement with all staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, premises and facilities and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum should be consistent with the prescribed curriculum framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum should be informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, whƒÅnau, and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the practices of adults providing education and care should demonstrate an understanding of children's learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when children leave the premises on an excursion, appropriate assessment and management of risk is undertaken and documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that children's access to the licensed space is not unnecessarily limited.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1, C2, C4, PF2, HS17.</em></p><p>Since the onsite phase of the review, the service has taken steps to satisfactorily amend the excursion and risk management processes.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>3 June 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
