</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Buckland Street Childcare Centre (2010) is a privately owned childcare centre located in Putaruru, now licensed under the Ministry of Education, Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. It provides education and care services for children from approximately two and a half to five years of age, and is commonly known as the Buckland Street Preschool. The preschool operates as a combined early childhood service with an infants and toddlers centre on the same site. The number of children enrolled has increased this year. Currently there are 71 children enrolled in the preschool, of whom 11 are identified as Māori.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, there have been significant leadership appointments that include the office manager, and new head teacher. The owner has formed a combined management team comprising these new leaders, the head teacher of the infants and toddlers section, and herself. The centre has maintained a high proportion of qualified staff. Detailed strategic and annual plans have been developed.</p><p>The service has a positive reporting history with ERO. The previous ERO review in February 2011 identified areas for development in relation to the centre’s philosophy, self review and curriculum. The combined management team, with the support of staff, has made considerable progress in these areas.</p><p>The revised philosophy expresses the intention to provide a safe and inclusive environment that acknowledges Aotearoa/New Zealands’ dual cultural heritage. The philosophy also includes an emphasis on awareness of the natural world and sustainability, promoting children’s physical wellbeing and encouraging them to become lifelong learners through exploration and play.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Buckland Street Childcare Centre (2010) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for all children. Staff have established close, respectful and inclusive relationships with children and their families that foster a sense of belonging and wellbeing. Key teachers support children through transitions into and between the two services.</p><p>Teachers take time to listen to children, notice their current interests and respond with learning conversations to support and extend play. They have established an effective planning and assessment process that is focussed on developing dispositional learning, as well as skills and social competencies. Increasingly, children are given the opportunities and access to resources that enable them to initiate and engage in their own play. Individual learning journals are well presented, informative and shared frequently with children and their families/whānau.</p><p>Strengths of the centre’s curriculum and environment include:</p><ul>
<li>an emphasis on valuing the culture, language and heritage of Māori children and their whānau</li>
<li>using the community as a resource to extend learning experiences</li>
<li>an extensive outdoor environment that supports children’s physical confidence and development</li>
<li>aspects of early literacy and mathematics that are integrated through the context of play</li>
<li>routines that allow children more uninterrupted time to play and learn with and alongside each other</li>
<li>an increased range of learning areas and resources to support their learning.</li>
</ul><p>The full potential of the programme is likely to be realised by further review and development of the building and physical learning environment.</p><p>Self review is systematic, ongoing and well documented. The process has been effectively used to inform centre improvement, especially in the areas of transition to school. Children and their families/whānau are well supported as they prepare to start school. Staff contribute to, and receive useful feedback from, community liaison meetings with local schools. These interactions allow teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of the support they have given each child and their family/whānau. While teachers organise a ‘STAR’ area for four-year old-children, ERO and centre management agree that there is a need to further review this programme and environment to support children's learning as they prepare for school.</p><p>The combined management team is working effectively and collaboratively to strengthen the quality of this early childhood service. They have been involved in the development of administrative and communication systems to support more efficient operations. Robust reporting and self-review processes ensure the owner is well informed and confident that the centre is meeting its regulatory requirements. Professional development opportunities for staff are financially supported and aligned with the overall vision, direction and philosophy of the centre. Several staff have undertaken the ‘Incredible Years Teacher’ programme aimed at strengthening the positive guidance approach to managing children’s behaviour. Members of the management team are relatively new in their leadership roles. There would be benefit in continuing to build their professional knowledge and confidence as leaders of teaching and curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that priorities for strategic development and professional learning include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building teachers knowledge and confidence to work more effectively within the context of an emergent and child-initiated curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance management and teacher registration processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Buckland Street Childcare Centre (2010) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Buckland Street Childcare Centre (2010) will be in three years .</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>14 January 2014 </p><div>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
