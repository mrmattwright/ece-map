</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Buckland Street Childcare Centre is a privately owned all-day education and care service, located in expansive facilities in central Putaruru. The centre is licensed for 60 children, including a maximum of 16 under two years of age. The current roll is 81, and 14 children are identified as Māori.</p><p>In May 2016, the centre was purchased by new owners, Provincial Childcare Holdings Ltd (PCH) who provide a team of personnel with oversight of governance matters and professional leadership. A new centre manager with responsibility for daily operations was appointed in 2016. Team leaders in the two age-specific rooms are responsible for planning, assessment and evaluation of the programme. The centre retains a high proportion of qualified staff, several of whom are of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre philosophy places an emphasis on holistic learning within an environment that is inclusive, respectful and welcoming. Children's identity, language and culture are to be acknowledged, respected and celebrated. Healthy living and eating is promoted. Children are encouraged to care for their natural environment.</p><p>The new owners have responded effectively to recommendations in the 2014 ERO report. Performance management, induction and mentoring systems for staff have been strengthened. Bicultural practices continue to be developed, and transitions into, within, and from the centre have been reviewed and improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families/whānau are made to feel welcome and valued at the centre. Relationships between teachers and children are affirming, encouraging and supportive. Teachers make consistent use of effective strategies to positively guide children's behaviour and to promote social play. A next step is for routines for older children to be reviewed to more deliberately promote their self-management skills. Children with additional needs are well supported and respectfully included in the programme. Centre leaders are committed to building effective partnerships with outside agencies to support these children. Children are settled and confident to approach adults for help. Regular shared celebrations foster the development of children's strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Children's language, identity and culture is acknowledged. Teachers have undertaken professional development in aspects of culturally responsive practice and this is evident in the increasingly natural use of te reo Māori, respect for tikanga, and the deliberate fostering of children's awareness of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa. Māori children see their culture and language affirmed by adults they respect.</p><p>Children up-to-two years of age play and learn in a calm and settled environment. Infants and toddlers experience high levels of nurture and care through familiar routines and regular communication with parents. Teachers in this area have participated in recent professional development related to best practice for very young children. Infants and toddlers benefit from high levels of care and respect, as they explore and develop in a safe and stimulating environment.</p><p>The centre programme provides children with a wide range of learning opportunities and experiences in the spacious indoor and outside environments. The programme is a mixture of teacher-led and child-initiated play within set routines. The outdoor play areas provide extensive opportunities for children to explore, find adventure and experience physical challenge. Children have direct involvement in growing, harvesting and eating vegetables and fruit. Early literacy skills are integrated into songs, puppetry, the sharing of stories and writing. Children's creativity is encouraged and they have opportunities for dramatic and role play. Particular areas of the curriculum for strengthening are aspects of literacy, mathematical and science concepts, and language.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a good knowledge of children's learning and development, and document this through learning stories shared through individual profile books and online portfolios. There are examples where teachers have added complexity to the learning of individual children, but this is not consistently evident. Well-planned transitions provide support and guidance for children and their parents as they move into, within, and from the centre. This includes visits to local schools and new entrant teachers visiting the centre to share information.</p><p>The centre manager provides effective leadership for the efficient day-to-day operation of the centre. She has long-established and positive relationships with staff and the local community. The manager works collaboratively with team leaders and teachers to oversee programme planning and assessment. The next step is for centre leaders to participate in professional development to strengthen their shared understanding of current best practice in teaching and learning across the centre. This should include setting expectations for teachers about curriculum implementation and the presentation of the environment that responds to the needs, particularly, of older children.</p><p>The PCH management team is well qualified and experienced, and is providing highly effective professional leadership and informed guidance for centre staff. Performance management systems and processes have been significantly strengthened, and are focussed on continual improvements in teaching practice. Provisionally certificated teachers receive extensive induction and mentoring programmes of support. Self review is well documented and places the centre in a good position to sustain and further improve the quality of provision of education and care for children.</p><p>PCH demonstrates a commitment to making good quality education and care affordable to families. Fees for children to attend the centre have been reduced, and parents/whānau are given relevant advice and guidance concerning support that is available for them. PCH has retained the existing name and respects the unique community character of the centre. Relevant strategic and annual plans have been developed and shared with the community, and financial resources made available to increase resourcing levels and to support staff development. PCH is providing practical and effective support to children and families to participate in a well-resourced early childhood education and care service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>PCH has identified the need to continue to support the centre manager and team leaders as they seek to further develop teachers' understanding and implementation of intentional planning, assessment and teaching.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Buckland St Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Buckland St Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>10 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
