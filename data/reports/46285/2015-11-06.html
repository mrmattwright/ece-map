</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre is a new, purpose built service that has been operating since November 2013. The centre provides full day and sessional care and education for up to 70 children, including a small number less than two years of age. Children are organised into three separate age-related groups known as Whenua, Wai and Ngahere. The two older groups share some facilities and their outdoor play area. This is the first review of the centre.</p><p>The centre is owned by an extended family. Two family members work collaboratively with the head teacher to manage the service. They have strategically staffed the centre with a multicultural team of teachers who reflect several of the cultures in the diverse community they serve. Most staff members are registered teachers. Managers support the ongoing professional development of staff and are committed to maintaining strong relationships with families.</p><p>The centre philosophy embraces <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and expresses commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Managers and teachers‚Äô aim for children is for them to ‚Äòacquire the skills that are needed to become confident and competent learners‚Äô.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well settled in this welcoming environment. They enjoy warm relationships with teachers and interact well with their friends. Children‚Äôs learning is enriched by the cultural diversity of the centre and by teachers who know what it is like to be a second language learner. Children confidently make choices about their play and engage well in ongoing projects that support their interests. They would now benefit from more consistent challenges in their learning programmes.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in Whenua are generally content in the care of attentive teachers. Adults provide individual support for unsettled babies and they respect them as capable learners. There is good communication with families and transition to the Wai room is thoughtfully managed in consultation with parents. A planned review of the teaching philosophy in this room should include further consideration of the ways the Whenua programme, including the outdoor environment, meets the needs and interest of children under two years of age.</p><p>Teachers support children to use resources and engage in prepared activities. Teachers enthusiastically lead mat time activities and frequently incorporate te reo MƒÅori in their interactions. They encourage children to use their home languages and provide effective cultural support through programme activities and the celebration of special events. The head teacher models strategies for teachers to extend children's learning very well. Her open questions foster complexity in children's play and encourages them to solve problems.</p><p>Teachers are developing new processes for managing the play programmes. They meet regularly to discuss children's interests and have used related topics to provide aspects of science, literacy and numeracy in activities and resources. A recent change to provide multiple perspectives in children‚Äôs portfolios is a positive step towards making documentation more meaningful. Identifying specific strategies that will help guide teachers‚Äô work with children could enhance the programme plans and result in more challenging learning experiences for children.</p><p>The centre provides attractive and spacious indoor environments for children. Natural wood furniture and lockers for children contribute to their sense of wellbeing and belonging. The 'L' shaped outdoor area has been carefully laid out to maximise the use of space. Teachers should continue to review and develop their supervision practices and plans for this area to ensure that the full range of play options is regularly available and that children, including babies, can play safely and confidently outdoors.</p><p>The managers are capable leaders and thoughtful employers. They have established a sound policy framework, developed effective health and safety practices and implemented positive personnel systems. Ongoing self review is highly valued as a means to enhance practices and improve outcomes for children. Managers put considerable effort into involving parents and staff in reviews. They encourage teachers to reflect critically on practices through meaningful appraisal and feedback processes.</p><p>A professional development programme for all staff, focused on improving the kaupapa MƒÅori lens in teachers‚Äô practice, is about to get underway. This demonstrates managers‚Äô belief that biculturalism should underpin the diversely multicultural opportunities the centre provides.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing development of individual planning to strengthen guidance for teachers‚Äô roles in the programme</li>
<li>reviewing aspects of the programme including the provision for infants, mat times and the extent to which children are engaged in meaningful learning</li>
<li>considering leadership roles for teachers to enhance their sense of ownership and responsibility for programmes</li>
<li>establishing a formal strategic plan to guide the long-term development of the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
