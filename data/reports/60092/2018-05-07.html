</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre Ltd (Boulcott) is one of eight learning services in the Wellington region, owned and operated by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd, a national organisation. The centre is licensed for up to 70 children, including 25 up to two years of age. Of the 91 children enrolled, 11 are Māori and five are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The purpose-built centre caters for children in age specific rooms that access shared outdoor spaces. Kindercare provides an overarching philosophy, policies and procedures and a framework to monitor health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support the operation of the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on three key values identified in the organisations overarching philosophy, ‘Safe, Loved and Learning’. </p><p>Since the March 2015 ERO report there have been changes to staffing, including leadership. The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included: integration of bicultural perspectives in practice and guiding documentation; parent and child contribution to learning; and programme planning and evaluation processes. Some progress is evident.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Kindercare Learning Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers are sensitively and responsively cared for by staff. Good two-way information sharing between home and centre is evident. Opportunities for teachers and parents to work together to support children's social and emotional development is well supported by management.</p><p>Older children have opportunities to engage with a wide range of resources and experiences that allow them to follow their interests. A combination of teacher-directed and child-initiated learning is evident and their independence is promoted. Literacy and numeracy activities are integrated throughout the daily programme.  Leaders have identified that strengthening the <br> transition-to-school process continues to be a focus. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction. </p><p>Group planning guides the provision of a wide range of engaging activities. The service has taken steps to gather parent aspirations. Overall, curriculum planning and assessment practices require further work. To improve practice, consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>deeper analysis of children's significant learning overtime</li>
<li>planning intentional teaching practices that are responsive to individual's cultures, languages and identities</li>
<li>making plans that are responsive to parents aspirations' and recording outcomes in children's learning stories.</li>
</ul><p>Some aspects of biculturalism are part of the programme. Teachers' use of te reo Māori and understanding of te ao Māori concepts are variable. Growing teacher knowledge and understanding, in order to implement a bicultural curriculum, is a priority.</p><p>It is timely that the service, in collaboration with whānau and families, review the philosophy to ensure that it reflects the learning that is valued within the context of this centre. As part of this review, leaders and teachers should take into consideration the extent in which the bicultural intent of <em>Te Whāriki </em>(2017), the early childhood curriculum, is enacted within this service. This was an area for development in the previous ERO report.</p><p>Promoting educational success for Māori learners remains a key next step for leaders and teachers. Planning for this development, should be done in partnership with whānau to further guide teaching practices. Additionally, leaders have identified that strengthening teaching practices that are responsive to Pacific children and their families is necessary, to improve learning outcomes for these children.</p><p>Understanding of self review and internal evaluation is a continuing development. Teachers regularly take part in centre wide and individual room reviews to reflect on the delivery of the curriculum. A next step is for staff to determine, through evaluation, the effectiveness of their teaching actions on outcomes for children to better inform decision making.</p><p>Governance and management systems are well established and provide a clear framework for centre operation. There is a strong focus on building leadership. A key next step is for Kindercare to strengthen guiding policies and procedures to better acknowledge te ao Māori. Clearer expectations and guidance for teachers to implement a Treaty-based curriculum is required to improve practice at centre level.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>the philosophy guiding teaching and learning to support the intended learning outcomes specific to this service and reflect the bicultural intent of <em>Te Whāriki</em></li>
<li>programme planning and assessment that is more responsive to individual learning and parents' aspirations for their children</li>
<li>deliberate strategies to improve learning outcomes for Māori and Pacific children</li>
<li>understanding of internal evaluation to better inform decision making.</li>
</ul><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd should strengthen policies, procedures and other guiding documentation to establish clearer expectations and guidance for teachers about curriculum and the bicultural intent of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017) and these should align with the relevant licensing criteria.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre Ltd (Boulcott) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centre Ltd (Boulcott)will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>7 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
