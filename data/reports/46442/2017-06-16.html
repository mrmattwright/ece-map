</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Create Limited 2 is one of four home-based education and care networks owned by Kids Create Limited. This network is licensed for 80 children from birth to five years of age. Children enrolled in this network are from across South, West, East and Central Auckland.</p><p>A team of four qualified programme coordinators oversee the delivery of the curriculum to educators who provide education and care for up to four children in each of the homes. Most of the educators are family members such as grandparents. Most children have Pacific or Māori heritage.</p><p>The service's philosophy promotes education, collaboration and empowerment for all children. A strong meaningful Pacific and New Zealand bicultural approach underpin learning experiences for all children. Positive family and community connections provide children with a foundation for learning. Respectful, responsive relationships are nurtured, and children's language, culture and identity is valued.</p><p>The organisation's directors, who are also members of the Board, work closely with the team of programme coordinators. There are well developed policies and systems to manage the fast growing demand for home-based education and care in the Pacific community of greater Auckland. Additional staff have responsibilities to oversee the operations and management of the service and together with leaders embed the services' vision and strategic direction.</p><p>This is the first report for this network since being established in 2014.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two home-based network reviews in the Kids Create organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kids Create Limited's vision reflects a strong commitment to early childhood education within a context of a home setting. The service is driven by a belief in the importance of belonging, wellbeing, culture and identity based on values of respect and inclusion. High expectations for literacy and numeracy are prioritised.</p><p>Children's learning and involvement in a variety of experiences in the home and community is recorded in attractive portfolios. Documentation shows that children are developing a strong sense of cultural identity and support to use their first language. Programme coordinators model how to analyse children's learning and guide educators to build a picture of the child's engagement in activities. Children's confidence in their growing understanding of the broader curriculum is documented clearly for parents. Parents are invited to contribute to the programme for children, and their aspirations provide good feedback for educators.</p><p>Robust health and safety systems and clear guidelines are in place. Very effective monitoring of health and safety systems in homes is well documented and informs the service's auditor-required maintenance. Culturally appropriate and respectful approaches support the accountability of educators in homes.</p><p>A culturally responsive curriculum has been developed. It is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em> and aligned to the service's philosophy. Programme coordinators are committed to working collaboratively with educators to promote play-based approaches to learning. Programme coordinators meet regularly to plan programmes that are increasingly responsive to children's interests. Children's rights are considered and their wellbeing is a strong focus for building trusting and responsive relationships between educators, children and their whānau.</p><p>The commitment to acknowledging Māori heritage is promoted through te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme. Whānau/parent perspectives are included, and constructive feedback from parents is used to inform the bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Educators are well supported through regular professional learning. Programme coordinators' reports of visits and educators' practice are presented regularly to the Board. There are various opportunities for coordinators and educators to share and learn about quality education and care in the homes, and appropriate support is given to educators to develop their practice.</p><p>An effective leadership structure with clear lines of accountability based on relational trust is in place for all staff. There are many opportunities to grow leadership capability and pathways for promotion in the service.</p><p>Open communication is evident in meetings at all levels. Strong learning partnerships with parents and whānau show the service's commitment to building whānau/parents' understanding of the New Zealand education system. Bicultural practice is an ongoing priority of the service.</p><p>Internal evaluation is becoming well understood. Leaders and programme coordinators have developed a good process to evaluate practice, guide improvements and inform future direction.</p><p>Strategic and annual plans identify priorities around positive outcomes for children that contribute to the service successfully achieving its vision. These plans are clearly documented and well monitored.</p><p>There are very good management systems in place. A comprehensive set of policies is regularly reviewed and updated and define clear expectations for all staff. Performance management is a current focus for development. An external provider is currently working with leaders to refine the appraisal process and other areas of the centre's organisation and administration. They now need to align the appraisal process to the Education Council's Practising Teacher Criteria and promote more quality reflection resulting in improved teaching practice.</p><p>A genuine commitment to <em>te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> and the place of tangata whenua in Aotearoa is well understood by all staff. Combining this with understanding of Pacific cultural identity has helped to develop a culturally responsive service for the service's diverse community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and programme coordinators agree that to enhance effective practices they could:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop educator knowledge of children's learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align the service's vision and philosophy with its strategic direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the effectiveness of planning, assessment and evaluation on positive outcomes for children, and how well educators extend children's interests over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Create Limited 2 completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Create Limited 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>16 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
