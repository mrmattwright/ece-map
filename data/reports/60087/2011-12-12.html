<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kura Pepe O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten caters for children between the ages of six months and five years. It works closely with the adjacent Kura Tamaiti O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten sharing the site and head teacher. The hours of the service were restructured at the beginning of 2011 following community consultation. This provides parents with a variety of choices when selecting early childhood education.</p><p align="left">Children are calm and settled within the positive learning environments. Routines and expectations are well understood by children and contribute to their well-being. Children freely access a range of resources to support their current interests. They are able to pursue sustained, independent and cooperative play. Teachers provide good support for children to make choices about their play and transition within and beyond the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Teachers have developed a consistent, shared process for planning. This enables children&rsquo;s strengths, needs and interests to emerge and develop. They reflect on the programme, identify children&rsquo;s learning and consider actions and strategies to better support children.</p><p align="left">Portfolios provide detailed individualised records of children's involvement in the programme. These records identify elements of learning and development, celebrate successes and are readily accessible for parents to share in their children&rsquo;s learning and to promote learning partnerships.</p><p align="left">The head teacher is effectively leading change. She is taking a strategic approach to the implementation of consistent practices that enhance the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively to develop a professional learning community. They have a shared vision and goals. These provide a good basis for self review. Management and staff have identified, and are progressively working on, areas for development and review. These include the strengthening of self review, and assessment, planning and evaluation practices. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation concurs with these developments.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kura Pepe O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKura Pepe O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the interactions between children and adults;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>programme provided for children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of two licensed early childhood services sharing the same site that offer different session times. In 2011 a change in the management structure resulted in the appointment of a senior head teacher who oversees both services. Two sessions are run on the Kura Pepe site.</p><p align="left">The first is known as Isola, which runs from 8.30 to 11.00 am each day and is run similarly to a playgroup. Parents and caregivers attend the Isola playgroup with their children. Provision is made for up to six children to attend without a significant adult accompanying them.</p><p align="left">The second is a four hour daily kindergarten session for children from three to five years old from 11.00 am to 3.10 pm, referred to as Kura Pepe.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Interactions</strong></p><p align="left">Children cooperate well and regularly support each other as they engage in exploration and creative activities. They are friendly and inclusive. Children confidently communicate with their teachers and each other.</p><p align="left">Teachers promote positive, caring, respectful interactions with and between children. They are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and support them to manage their learning. Staff members work well as a coordinated team to effectively provide for children&rsquo;s needs. Use of te reo M&#257;ori is evident in conversations, instructions, and in routines. Some good quality teacher interactions support children&rsquo;s developing interests and make connections to earlier learning experiences.</p><p align="left">Provision for infants and toddlers Teachers working with infants and toddlers in the Isola playgroup model high quality interactions. They structure the programme and routines to follow the natural rhythms of children in their care. Planning is well displayed to make information clear and available to parents.</p><p><strong>Learning Environment</strong></p><p align="left">Children are calm and settled within the positive learning environments. They are able to self select from a wide range of resources which allows for sustained, independent and cooperative play. Teachers further support learning through purposefully selected resources and by responding to children&rsquo;s requests for additional equipment. Routines and expectations are well understood.</p><p align="left">Children have a variety of choices for messy, creative and active play and freely pursue their interests. Afternoon access to the neighbouring Kura Tamaiti environment provides children with increased opportunities for interaction and learning.</p><p align="left">Parent and Wh&#257;nau Partnerships Staff demonstrate a high level of commitment to engage with parents and wh&#257;nau to share information about children. Parents are made to feel welcome and teachers value their contributions.</p><p><strong>Programme</strong></p><p align="left">Teachers are developing a consistent, shared process for planning. This process enables children&rsquo;s strengths, needs and interests to emerge and develop. Opportunities for regular dialogue and communication allow teachers to reflect on the programme, identify children&rsquo;s learning and consider actions and strategies to support children's growth. Teachers appropriately promote children's developing physical and social skills.</p><p align="left">The use of te reo M&#257;ori is evident in the kindergarten and teachers are being supported to share their strengths and build capacity in te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori across the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Portfolios provide individualised records of children's involvement in the programme, identify elements of learning and development, and celebrate successes. These are readily accessible, allowing parents and wh&#257;nau to share in their children&rsquo;s learning and promote learning partnerships.</p><p align="left">Teachers effectively focus on building common practices across the kindergarten to ease children's transitions within the kindergarten and between learning activities. They have strengthened relationships with local schools and formalised the process for transition to school to foster children's familiarity with new environments and practices.</p><p align="left">The head teacher effectively leads change. She demonstrates a strategic approach to the development of consistent practices across the kindergarten. A focus on enhancing the quality of teaching and learning drives improvement. The expanded appraisal process provides effective support for teachers to develop their capability and professional responsibilities in line with the kindergarten&rsquo;s vision and priorities.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively within a developing professional learning community. They engage positively in regular opportunities to examine and discuss their practice. Professional readings and information are sourced and shared to build understanding of effective practice and support ongoing development to improve outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Self review A considered approach to establishing effective self-review practices across the kindergarten is underway. The practice statement clearly articulates a shared vision and aims for the kindergarten, and provides a basis for self review. Teachers engage in reflective examination of their practices to determine priorities for improvement.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Management and staff have identified the need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and embed effective self review</li>
<li>consistently promote rich, sustained and purposeful conversations linked to learning pathways to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and add complexity to their play</li>
<li>strengthen assessment practices to more consistently identify children&rsquo;s learning, show development over time and how learning might be enhanced</li>
<li>actively promote opportunities for children to revisit their learning</li>
<li>implement planned development of the outdoor environment to increase the variety and challenge of learning opportunities.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s evaluation affirms these directions.</p><p align="left">To strengthen bicultural aspects of the programme further engagement with wh&#257;nau is needed to ascertain aspirations and enrich connections within the community.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kura-pepe-o-tapu-te-ranga-island-bay-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kura Pepe O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kura Pepe O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Kura Pepe O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten caters for children between the ages of six months and five years. It works closely with the adjacent Kura Tamaiti O Tapu Te Ranga Island Bay Kindergarten sharing the site and head teacher. The hours of the service were restructured at the beginning of 2011 following community consultation. This provides parents with a variety of choices when selecting early childhood education.</p><p align="left">Children are calm and settled within the positive learning environments. Routines and expectations are well understood by children and contribute to their well-being. Children freely access a range of resources to support their current interests. They are able to pursue sustained, independent and cooperative play. Teachers provide good support for children to make choices about their play and transition within and beyond the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Teachers have developed a consistent, shared process for planning. This enables children&rsquo;s strengths, needs and interests to emerge and develop. They reflect on the programme, identify children&rsquo;s learning and consider actions and strategies to better support children.</p><p align="left">Portfolios provide detailed individualised records of children's involvement in the programme. These records identify elements of learning and development, celebrate successes and are readily accessible for parents to share in their children&rsquo;s learning and to promote learning partnerships.</p><p align="left">The head teacher is effectively leading change. She is taking a strategic approach to the implementation of consistent practices that enhance the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively to develop a professional learning community. They have a shared vision and goals. These provide a good basis for self review. Management and staff have identified, and are progressively working on, areas for development and review. These include the strengthening of self review, and assessment, planning and evaluation practices. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation concurs with these developments.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Kathleen Atkins</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region</p></html>
