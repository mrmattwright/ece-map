<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Burnham Nursery and Preschool governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the effectiveness of management practices, including an ongoing programme of self review that sustains improvements</li>
<li>the quality of education, including teaching, planning, assessment and review</li>
<li>relationships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and the community that reflect and enhance the bicultural partnership</li>
<li>progress in using the action plan and effective use of external support to bring about the necessary improvements.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Burnham Nursery and Preschool is a not-for-profit organisation run by a parent committee. The staff are qualified early childhood teachers or in training as early childhood teachers. Many staff have worked at the centre for a number of years. Teachers are very aware of the unique context of the tamariki and their wh&#257;nau with many parents working overseas for the military.</p><p>Staff have made considerable progress in addressing the recommendations of the May 2012 ERO report. The action plan, developed with ERO, helped the centre to clarify its next steps. The centre director, supported by the committee, promptly took action and sought external support and professional development for staff. There is a high level of commitment to making the necessary changes and a more unified approach to meeting the needs and interests of children. The centre leaders recognise the need to maintain the pace of change as they continue to use the action plan.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The committee and staff now have a vision and philosophy that set out what they want to achieve for children and their families. Previous documentation focused on caring for children without reference to providing good quality education. These are now both valued and included. The new strategic plan provides useful guidelines for making future improvements. A number of policies and procedures have been reviewed and updated to provide teachers with clear expectations for their practice. The staff and committee have a shared understanding of the goals and direction of the centre.</p><p>Job descriptions have been clarified and updated. The centre director and teachers have developed a new team contract that better supports the way they will work together to meet the interests and needs of children.</p><p>The committee has supported improvements in practice through professional development for all staff and a mentor for the centre manager. Coaching sessions have helped teachers improve the quality of assessments to more accurately notice and respond to children&rsquo;s learning. Staff stated how useful this was in helping them understand what needed to be done and in supporting them to make changes.</p><p>The centre director and teachers have developed a useful process of self review. While this is in the early stages, teachers are building their confidence by leading and contributing to self review. Teachers regularly think about ways to improve their teaching practice and ultimately children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Significant improvements can be seen in the quality of planning and assessment. Increased levels of professional discussion are having a positive impact on teacher practice. There are clear links between planning, children&rsquo;s developing interests, and assessments for meeting the needs of individual children. This is particularly noticeable in the nursery.</p><p>ERO observed children in sustained play in the nursery and preschool. Children confidently expressed their needs and interests to teachers who were responsive and caring. There is an increased depth of understanding about children&rsquo;s learning shown in the learning stories. Teachers are working well together to support the children in their care.</p><p>Te reo M&#257;ori is used with children in the nursery and preschool and can be seen in learning stories. Some staff members express interest in developing their use of te reo M&#257;ori and are currently enrolled in a professional development programme.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Further refinements need to be made to management and teaching practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>improving strategic planning to show the different actions that will be taken each year so that goals can be met over time</li>
<li>managing effective self review showing recommendations, next steps and outcomes for children within a set timeframe</li>
<li>ensuring newly introduced planning and assessment practices are used consistently and well so all children receive good quality programmes and assessment</li>
<li>developing the indoor areas to engage children&rsquo;s curiosity and creativity and parents&rsquo; interests.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees with the centre manger that the next steps are to develop stronger relationships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and community to form an effective bicultural partnership. While this area for development is scheduled for review in May 2013, it is important that this is now made a priority.</p><a id="3-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>The centre manager has not had a completed appraisal since 2011. Information regarding the appraisal has been gathered, but has not yet been completed or shared with the centre manager.</p><ul>
<li>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must:</li>
<li>ensure the centre manager is regularly appraised.</li>

Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
