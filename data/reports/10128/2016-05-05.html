</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fatugatiti Preschool is a Christian based, total immersion Samoan aoga amata in Papatoetoe, Auckland. It provides care and education for children from three months to five years of age. The aoga is licensed for 47 children, including 10 children up to the age of two years. It has a growing roll and is located on the grounds of the Manukau Pacific Island Presbyterian Church.</p><p>The aoga is administered by a board of governors consisting of church members and parent and staff representatives. The minister of the church is the patron of the board. A centre manager oversees the daily operations of the aoga, and works closely with the education specialist teacher who provides leadership and guidance on curriculum development, delivery and associated documentation.</p><p>Findings of ERO's past four reviews indicated that there was not sufficient progress made to improve the quality of education and care provided for children. However, since ERO's 2013 report the board and staff have made significant progress in addressing the recommendations from previous reports. Matters of urgency included improving the effectiveness of teaching practice, governance, management, self review, and staff appraisal and induction systems.</p><p>The significant changes that are noted in this report acknowledge the good leadership, management and governance of the aoga. This has provided teachers with clear direction and the opportunity to improve the programme to bring about more positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a sense of belonging to the aoga. They are confident and enjoy learning through play. They show respect for each other and for the environment as they make choices about their learning. They speak gagana Samoa confidently and demonstrate pride in being Samoan. Children form good friendships and older children are encouraged to support and care for younger toddlers.</p><p>Children understand the routines well and are learning independence by using their self-help skills. They enjoy the many opportunities for physical exercise and excursions. Children demonstrate a developing understanding of sustainable practices and heathy eating practices.</p><p>The environment is welcoming and readily accessible resources help children to manage their own learning. It reflects the Samoan culture and promotes the centre's philosophy of developing children's language, culture and identity. Teachers display children's work with care and children enjoy revisiting the displays. The spacious indoor and outdoor environment provides children with good choices of play areas.</p><p>Teachers work well together to promote the values of the aoga. They are all fluent in gagana Samoa and enjoy supporting children in their play. The curriculum programme promotes the principles of<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Many of the staff are long serving and have built good relationships with families and parents. There are good leadership opportunities for staff. They are involved in regular professional conversations and are supported to implement the aoga‚Äôs philosophy. Teachers‚Äô appraisal processes are useful and provide opportunities for staff to identify meaningful goals. Leaders encourage teachers to attend professional development and to consolidate their skills and expertise.</p><p>The education specialist teacher leads the development of the aoga's curriculum implementation, delivery and assessment. Through modelling good practice and working alongside staff to share their practice, teachers have raised their expectations for teaching and learning. A rigorous self-review process supports teachers to make improvements to the programme and their practice. They work collaboratively to make decisions and evaluate the programme for children.</p><p>Parents have opportunities to contribute to the programme and to participate in reviews of aoga systems and practices. They are invited to suggest changes and talk to teachers about their child's learning progress. Newsletters and social media forums keep parents informed of the aoga's activities, teachers' expectations for children's education and how parents can support their child at home.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board and management team have identified appropriate next steps for the aoga. These include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve and embed good practice and current changes to procedures and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use current research to inform ongoing development of teaching and learning practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen partnerships with parents to promote shared understandings about early childhood education and the curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fatugatiti Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fatugatiti Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
