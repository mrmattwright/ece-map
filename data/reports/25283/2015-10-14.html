</table><p>The Otara Community Preschool requires ongoing support to establish effective governance and management practice and good quality programmes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Otara Community Preschool is located in Otara, South Auckland. It promotes bilingual education for its multicultural community and is licensed for 50 children over two years. The preschool operates under the Multicultural Christian Educational and Sporting Trust. The trust has accessed Ministry of Education (MoE) Targeted Assistance for Participation funding to extend and upgrade its facilities. Building work is expected to be completed before the end of 2015. The board will then seek to extend the preschool‚Äôs licence to cater for children up to the age of two.</p><p>The preschool has had a varied reporting history with ERO identifying some good progress in 2007 and 2010. In 2013 ERO reported that insufficient progress had been made in programme planning, the quality of teaching and centre self review. ERO continues to have concerns about the lack of progress in these areas.</p><p>The preschool was placed on a provisional license in 2013 and provided with support from the MoE to meet licensing requirements. The preschool regained a full licence in November 2013. The manager has recently contracted an external provider to support the new teaching team to address areas for development identified in ERO‚Äôs 2013 report and build teachers‚Äô capability. Many improvements resulting from external support are at beginning stages. There is limited evidence of sustained centre-wide improvement. Trustees were not available to meet with ERO during this review. Neither was governance documentation made available.</p><p>Progress is not only hindered by poor governance and management practices but also by continuing high staff turnover. The preschool is led by a long serving manager and a head teacher who is very new to leadership. All of the teachers are new since the time of the 2013 ERO review. Four staff are provisionally registered teachers and two are in training. They are supported by an administrator.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers continue to provide a warm and caring environment that supports children‚Äôs participation in the programme. Children are happy and confident as they play. Interactions in the preschool are friendly and respectful. Parents appreciate teachers‚Äô open communication with them.</p><p>Families‚Äô home languages are encouraged and valued, and integrated in songs, prayers and conversations. Teachers have improved the learning environment so that it now reflects the preschool‚Äôs multicultural community.</p><p>Children‚Äôs individual portfolios align well with aspects of the early childhood curriculum and show children‚Äôs participation in the programme. With external support, teachers have begun to:</p><ul>
<li>provide a good range of activities and play scenarios for children to explore</li>
<li>implement programmes that are more responsive to children‚Äôs interests</li>
<li>establish self-review processes.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should continue to work with external advisers to improve curriculum leadership, as well as programme planning, implementation, and evaluation.</p><p>Governance and management are ineffective. Concerns that affect the viability and sustainability of the service include:</p><ul>
<li>lack of evidence that the Trust is meeting licensing requirements or providing adequate support for the manager and teaching team to fulfil their roles</li>
<li>the need to implement the recently developed teacher appraisal process and to appraise the performance of the manager</li>
<li>financial management and reporting issues identified by the service‚Äôs auditor.</li>
</ul><p>Trustees, the manager and head teacher should work with external professional advisers to:</p><ul>
<li>develop annual and strategic plans that are pertinent to the specific needs of the preschool</li>
<li>build the professional capacity and capability of all staff</li>
<li>ensure that the board is accountable and effectively fulfilling its governance role</li>
<li>establish self review that leads to improved outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Otara Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice the trustees and manager should:</p><ul>
<li>review and rationalise centre policies and procedures in consultation with staff and parents</li>
<li>ensure that staff adhere to the administration of medication policy and procedures.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service that must be addressed. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management and employment practices, including financial management and an ongoing process for self review that help maintain and improve the quality of education and care</li>
<li>programmes provided for children are informed by well documented planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, 7, 8, 9, C2.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Otara Community Preschool. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Otara Community Preschool will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Graham Randell <br>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
