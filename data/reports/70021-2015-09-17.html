</table><p>Montana Early Learning Centre is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Montana Early Learning Centre is one of two centres owned by the University of Canterbury Students' Association and is located close to the university campus. The centre manger is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre.</p><p>The centre serves a diverse community. This includes parents who are students, staff at the university and others from the local community. A large number of these families come from countries other than New Zealand.</p><p>The small, purpose-built centre has a maximum number of 35 children each day. It has three separate areas to cater for the specific learning needs of infants, toddlers and older children.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered. The ratio of teachers to children is higher than minimum standards. This provides good opportunities for one-on-one supportive interactions with children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have sustained the positive features identified in the May 2012 ERO report. They have also been responsive to the recommendations to refine annual planning and review assessment and planning processes.</p><p>Centre leaders are part of the local community cluster of primary schools, and early childhood centres, that promotes professional networks to support teaching and learning across the sectors.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers have a strong shared philosophy that is focused on working in respectful and responsive ways with children. The child-centred curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers foster positive, respectful and supportive relationships with children and their families. They work closely with families and agencies to help children with additional learning needs. Each child is seen as a capable learner. Teachers promote successful outcomes for all children using very inclusive practices.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers encourage a strong sense of belonging for children and families. The language, culture and identity of each child and their family is highly respected and celebrated. Teachers work closely with families to support children with English as a second language. Aspects of children‚Äôs home languages are integrated into the curriculum in meaningful ways.</p><p>The teaching team recognise and value the inclusion of MƒÅori perspectives. The individual strengths of some teachers are well used to help others to develop their understandings and use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori with children.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers effectively recognise that language and culture are key to Pacific children‚Äôs identity and positive sense of self. They work well with families to help maintain children‚Äôs connections to their cultural identity.</p><p>Children benefit from well presented and resourced environments. Teachers are responsive to the interests, strengths and capabilities of children. Literacy, mathematics and creative experiences are a natural part of the learning programme. Oral language development is central to children's learning and is meaningfully integrated into their routines and experiences. Visitors to the centre and excursions into the community further enrich the learning experiences offered to them.</p><p>The wellbeing of infants and toddlers is actively promoted within a well-paced programme. Responsive and consistent caregiving supports infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô need for strong and secure attachments. Teachers respond sensitively to each child‚Äôs changing needs and preferences through calm and unhurried routines that align to family expectations.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Strong leadership motivates and promotes a positive team culture. High expectations and individual coaching is helping teachers to develop reflective practice and teacher expertise.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers make good use of effective self-review processes, a new appraisal system and targeted professional development. They have a strong shared focus on ongoing improvement to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that priority should now be given to:</p><ul>
<li>refining strategic planning to provide focus for managing key centre goals</li>
<li>further developing assessment and planning practices to better reflect the depth of children‚Äôs learning and progress over time</li>
<li>identifying the teaching strategies used in planning, and evaluating the impact of these on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen bicultural perspectives in key documents and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montana Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montana Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>17 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
