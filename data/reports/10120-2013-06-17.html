<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Lynnmall is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Lynnmall is a well established centre. It has operated for several years as a joint venture between the present owner and the Lollipops Educare organisation. The centre is now privately owned under a franchise agreement with the company. Lollipops management, administration and personnel systems are used to support centre operations. A new centre manager has been appointed since the 2010 ERO review.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and older children are catered for in separate learning environments that are planned to support their developmental and learning progress. Families associated with the Lynnmall Shopping Centre and others from surrounding suburbs enrol in the centre. The education programme is responsive to the diverse cultural backgrounds of the children. Cultural celebrations are regularly observed.</p><p>The teaching team works collaboratively to support children&rsquo;s ongoing development. The centre manager is gradually becoming more knowledgeable about her increased responsibilities. Staff have contributed ideas to the design of a larger outdoor space for children to enjoy.</p><p>The previous ERO report recommended that centre managers further develop processes for reviewing the programme in action so that they continue to support positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the centre. Positive strategies are used to help new children settle quickly. New families are welcomed and an ongoing sense of belonging and inclusion is reflected in relationships between teachers and families.</p><p>Children are friendly and respectful toward one another. They manage meal times and personal care routines capably. Tuakana/teina relationships are encouraged. Older children help to support the welfare and wellbeing of younger children. Opportunities for children to participate during the day in mixed-age groups are a strong feature of the programme. Siblings and friends can spend time together and children are able to maintain relationships with teachers with whom they share special bonds.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They know children well and are attentive and responsive to their physical and emotional needs. Teachers come from a variety of cultural backgrounds. They use their first languages and cultural knowledge to help children and parents from diverse cultures to settle into the centre and into the programme.</p><p>Infants are provided for in a separate space where they can safely engage in a range of tactile, physical and social experiences. Teachers arrange opportunities for them to raise their awareness of others through short visits to play in mixed age groups settings.</p><p>Teachers maintain attractive records of children&rsquo;s individual learning. Individual development plans are regularly assessed and evaluated.</p><p>Self-review processes have been recently introduced. Updated appraisal documents detail key tasks and possible achievement outcomes. The new appraisal system is likely to help teachers to make ongoing improvements in their practice. The centre manager recognises that reviewing the centre&rsquo;s philosophy should result in improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The owner and centre manager acknowledge that some areas of practice could be better administered and have agreed that the centre manager and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>provide workshops to help parents understand how they can best support the development of their children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>ensure that curriculum planning provides opportunities for children to enjoy enriched learning</li>
<li>continue to use children&rsquo;s languages, including M&#257;ori and Pacific, to further promote children&rsquo;s languages, cultures and identities</li>
<li>continue to refine and strengthen self-review practices</li>
<li>review centre policies and procedures so that they better support teachers to promote positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The owner should ensure that the centre manager is formally inducted into her role and responsibilities.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Lollipops Educare Lynnmall completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to comply with legal requirements the centre owner must report to the centre&rsquo;s community about the use of each component of government equity funding.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
