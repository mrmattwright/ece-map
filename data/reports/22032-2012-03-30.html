<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1&nbsp;The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Titirangi Playcentre is a parent-led early childhood service that is affiliated to the Auckland Playcentres Association. The Playcentre philosophy of adults working together to benefit all children is very evident. Centre members share responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning and development and centre operations.</p><p align="left">Children have good opportunities to explore activities of their choice. They interact confidently with all adults who support their play in appropriate ways. Adults promote children&rsquo;s engagement through interactions that are calm and unhurried. Inclusive relationships and a welcoming tone are highly evident.</p><p align="left">The centre environment is attractive and appealing. Children make good use of the wide range of activities and resources. Well planned curriculum areas allow for uninterrupted play. Extensive building additions and renovations since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review have resulted in positive outcomes for children and adults. Centre members have plans for ongoing improvements to the outdoor area.</p><p align="left">The Playcentre is well placed to grow and develop. The centre is well attended and Playcentre training levels amongst centre members are high. Collaborative evaluation and decision-making about centre goals and priorities results in well considered strategic planning to guide development.</p><p align="left">Centre members have identified appropriate areas for programme development. In addition ERO identified that members could consider providing additional displays at children&rsquo;s eye level and increase the ways that te ao M&#257;ori is reflected in the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Titirangi Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTitirangi Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Centre members responded positively to ERO&rsquo;s previous review in November 2008. Well-developed self-review systems and practices and the commitment of centre members is ensuring that the Playcentre continues to grow.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Welcoming environment</h4><p align="left">Relationships within the centre are warm and inclusive. Adults model friendly interactions and provide good support for children to learn to play together in positive ways. Children comfortably engage with all adults and firm friendships are evident amongst older children.</p><h4 align="left">Child-led programme</h4><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s play preferences guide the programme. Centre members follow children&rsquo;s lead and offer suggestions and resources. They work closely with children in a relaxed way that promotes children&rsquo;s engagement. Flexible daily routines allow children to decide when they are ready to participate.</p><h4 align="left">Self review</h4><p align="left">Internal evaluation practices are well established and focus on Playcentre improvement. All aspects of centre operation are reviewed and evaluations are well documented. Centre members consider their programme provision for all age groups of children. They make good use of available self-review resources to guide their practice.</p><h4 align="left">Planning and assessing learning</h4><p align="left">Planning begins with parents identifying their child&rsquo;s interests and next steps for learning and development. These are updated each term and discussed at planning meetings. Portfolios are valued records of each child&rsquo;s time at Playcentre. While parents take responsibility for maintaining these, other centre members contribute their observations and stories to these documents.</p><h4 align="left">Environment</h4><p align="left">Children make good use of the well-planned environment and ample resources. Specific spaces for different activities allow for children&rsquo;s undisturbed play. Significant additions and renovations to the building since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review have resulted in positive outcomes for children and adults. Centre members have ongoing plans to improve outdoor play areas.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">Playcentre self review has identified priority areas for development. ERO agrees with centre members that these next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">enhance the programme for older children by increasing literacy, numeracy and science provision across the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">encourage and extend the complexity of children&rsquo;s play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">find useful ways to document and communicate children&rsquo;s progress and emerging interests to provide continuity between sessions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO recommended that centre members could consider:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">providing more displays at children&rsquo;s eye level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">increasing the ways te ao M&#257;ori is reflected in the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Titirangi Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p align="left">ERO and centre members agree that members continue to use their effective self review to identify and plan strategically for Playcentre development priorities.&nbsp;</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

The Playcentre philosophy of adults working together to benefit all children is very evident. Centre members share responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning and development and centre operations.</p><p align="left">Children have good opportunities to explore activities of their choice. They interact confidently with all adults who support their play in appropriate ways. Adults promote children&rsquo;s engagement through interactions that are calm and unhurried. Inclusive relationships and a welcoming tone are highly evident.</p><p align="left">The centre environment is attractive and appealing. Children make good use of the wide range of activities and resources. Well planned curriculum areas allow for uninterrupted play. Extensive building additions and renovations since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review have resulted in positive outcomes for children and adults. Centre members have plans for ongoing improvements to the outdoor area.</p><p align="left">The Playcentre is well placed to grow and develop. The centre is well attended and Playcentre training levels amongst centre members are high. Collaborative evaluation and decision-making about centre goals and priorities results in well considered strategic planning to guide development.</p><p align="left">Centre members have identified appropriate areas for programme development. In addition ERO identified that members could consider providing additional displays at children&rsquo;s eye level and increase the ways that te ao M&#257;ori is reflected in the programme.</p></html>
