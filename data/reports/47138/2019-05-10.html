</table><p>Happy Kids At Home Childcare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Happy Kids At Home Childcare is privately co-owned and operated. The network provides care and education for up to 80 children in the homes of educators. This is a standard funded network with the majority of the educators living locally. This is the service's first ERO review.</p><p>The network was established with the intention of increasing the participation of Chinese children in early childhood education. At the time of this review, there are 55 children enrolled in the network and 22 educators who work under the guidance and supervision of the two owners, who are qualified and registered early childhood teachers. As visiting teachers (VT), they visit educators at least once a month or more regularly if required. The VTs, educators and all children except for one, are of Chinese heritage.</p><p>The philosophy expresses a commitment to provide respectful care practices and learning in a bicultural environment. It recognises and embraces the partnerships espoused in Te Tiriti o Waitangi and acknowledges that <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, will guide the programme provided for children. An external provider is contracted to support and strengthen leaders' practice and pedagogy to further support educators.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service has a strong focus on the health, safety and wellbeing of children in its care. The VTs and educators monitor children's ongoing development and learning, and complete regular safety checks of homes. Visiting teachers provide opportunities for children and educators to experience a range of activities, including regular excursions. The music and movement sessions held in the local libraries are a popular part of the programme.</p><p>Visiting teachers help educators to understand the importance of children's learning through play and assist educators to recognise and support children's learning. Children up to two years of age enrolled in this network have their developmental milestones acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Providing children with authentic experiences of their heritage language and culture is a priority for this service. The majority of children are placed with a family member or someone connected with the family. Many of the educators have limited English. The VTs are fluent speakers of Mandarin and Cantonese. They are careful to facilitate communication with parents, and when needed in the home of the educator. The recent introduction of an online portal allows parents and whƒÅnau to see the VTs' monthly reports for their child, and to add their comments and stories if they wish.</p><p>The service is underpinned by genuine, supportive, culturally sensitive relationships. The VTs provide regular professional learning and development opportunities for educators to support them in their role.</p><p>Happy Kids At Home Childcare is a new service. Many of the systems, policies and procedures are in the embedding stage and some are still under development. Internal evaluation is used to improve planning and practice, and service operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for improving the service are for visiting teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the focus on play-based learning and help educators notice children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy in order to strengthen the guidance it provides to achieve the service vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop internal evaluation processes to promote greater depth of inquiry into educators' practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the feedback to educators on what is going well and what could be improved.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Happy Kids At Home Childcare completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>10 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
