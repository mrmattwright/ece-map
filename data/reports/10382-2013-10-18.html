</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Unlimited (Learning Centre) Ltd, located in Mt Albert, Auckland, caters for a maximum of 34 children from birth to five years of age. It is an all day education and care service where older children play in mixed-age groups and children under two years of age have a separate room. Specialised age-related teaching sessions occur for all children each afternoon.</p><p>The centre is multicultural and children come from the local area to take advantage of the home-like environment. Staff numbers have recently been enhanced due to the centre‚Äôs increased roll. The majority of staff are either fully qualified or in training.</p><p>The centre has four directors, with the head teacher and service provider owning and managing the service. The owners have responded positively to the priorities identified for review and development in the 2010 ERO report. Management systems, administration procedures and curriculum support underpin centre operations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive good quality care and education. Children are warmly welcomed to the centre and teachers develop friendly relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers use some te reo MƒÅori during the day. Some aspects of cultural identity are displayed in the centre. The owners seek parent help and advice on cultural practices. Multicultural aspects are evident within the learning environment. However, there needs to be further work on implementation.</p><p>The centre timetable allows for both regular routines and time for children to explore and play within the attractive and well organised environment. The outdoor area includes weather protection for all year round play. Although the outdoor space is limited, the teachers makes good use of this learning environment for children.</p><p>Teachers offer appropriate age-related group teaching and learning sessions for all children during the afternoon. Children from four years of age participate in a programme designed to support their transition to school. Children have opportunities to explore areas of interest and learn related literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>Children up to two years of age are catered for within a responsive and caring environment. The babies and toddlers room encourages children to develop physically and emotionally and explore their surroundings safely.</p><p>Teachers implement useful planning and assessment procedures for children to extend their interests by offering a variety of activities. Teachers evaluate the effectiveness of these activities regularly and modify or change the programme as appropriate.</p><p>Teacher‚Äôs professional learning is aligned to outcomes of the centre‚Äôs self review, and to areas identified through the owner‚Äôs participation in local ECE networking. The majority of teachers are yet to achieve full registration and are supported to meet the registered teacher‚Äôs criteria through mentoring from fully registered staff.</p><p>The owners have implemented good quality self-review procedures that ensure improvements are sustained. Owners are implementing good quality practices for the employment, performance management and ongoing professional development of teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on the good quality practices at the centre, centre owners and ERO agree that their next steps for learning include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing useful strategic planning by including all areas of operation and ongoing development of curriculum areas</li>
<li>strengthening the usefulness of assessment practices by including more formative assessment processes</li>
<li>documenting children‚Äôs ongoing learning by identifying their dispositions and using them to increase the complexity of their play</li>
<li>increasing teachers‚Äô capabilities and awareness of bi-cultural and multicultural practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Unlimited (Learning Centre) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the owners should consider external appraisal to meet teacher registration requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz Unlimited (Learning Centre) Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
