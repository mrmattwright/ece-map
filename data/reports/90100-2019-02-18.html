</table><p>Barnardos Early Learning Home Based Southland Two is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Home Based Southland Two provides individual care and education for children from birth to school age in the educator's home. It is part of the Barnardos Early Learning organisation.</p><p>Barnardos Early Learning Home Based Southland Two is a standard funded network. The network works collaboratively with Barnardos Early Learning Home Based Southland One to support its educators and children across a wide geographical area.</p><p>The organisation and the network have undergone significant organisational and management changes since the previous ERO review in 2012. The Barnardos Early Learning organisation has recently rebranded. It was previously known as Barnardos KidStart. The Southland Two network was previously known as KidStart Gore. A new leadership team has been in place since 2016. This includes a regional manager, practice advisor and visiting teacher who work together to support the educators to provide positive outcomes for children. They have addressed all of the areas identified for improvement identified in the previous ERO report.</p><p>In 2017 the vision and philosophy of the whole organisation was reviewed to create a stronger focus on the service's valued outcomes for children. It aims 'to have an Aotearoa New Zealand where every child shines bright'; 'create strong foundations for the future' and go from being 'credible to incredible'.</p><p>In 2018 Barnardos Early Learning policies and procedures were updated and aligned its quality assurance and accountability processes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five Early Learning Home Based Network reviews in the Barnardos Early Learning organisation cluster.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning records show that their security, wellbeing and belonging are well supported and responded to, within a small group setting, with a consistent educator. The individual interests, strengths and capabilities of all children (MƒÅori, diverse learners, infants and toddlers) are thoughtfully responded to. Children are offered opportunities to be involved in a wide range of interesting experiences within and beyond the home-based setting that enhance their learning and understandings of the local area and the natural world.</p><p>Service leaders and the visiting teacher work effectively together to develop educator's skills and reflective practices through individualised mentoring and coaching. Leaders promote bicultural practices that are respectful of the MƒÅori culture and meaningful for children. The aspirations and expectations of parents are valued and responded to. Purposeful links are made to external expertise to advocate for and support the wellbeing and learning of children with additional needs.</p><p>The Barnardos Early Learning Home Based organisation has recently introduced and actioned a number of new initiatives. The purpose of these initiatives is to provide assurance of consistent, collaborative and professional approaches to support equity and excellence for all children. This¬† includes:</p><ul>
<li>clear alignment of key priorities to the Barnardos vision, philosophy, and valued outcomes for children</li>
<li>strong collaborative leadership and inclusive, learner-focused relationships within and across the service and with relevant community expertise</li>
<li>giving prominence to te ao MƒÅori and culturally responsive practices across the organisation</li>
<li>developing initiatives to respond to the diverse needs of learners and to promote equity and social justice for children and families</li>
<li>high expectations and purposeful use of evidence-based internal evaluation and quality assurance processes to inform future directions and improvements</li>
<li>effective systems to identify, monitor and report on health and safety and legislative requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps for the Southland Two Network are to:</p><ul>
<li>embed new initiatives, including annual planning and evaluation, policies, procedures and appraisal processes</li>
<li>align and personalise the organisation's philosophy to the network philosophy</li>
<li>further develop internal evaluation, including an explicit focus on the impact of actions on outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau¬†</li>
<li>further develop and build on consistency of best practice in assessment, planning and evaluation, including fully implementing Te WhƒÅriki (2017).</li>
</ul><p>National and service leaders have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps for the organisation are to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>embed new initiatives and evaluate the impact of actions on practice and valued learning outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau¬†</li>
<li>progress the monitoring, tracking and evaluation of key priorities</li>
<li>consolidate and build on reflective and evaluative practices.¬†</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Home Based Southland Two completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Early Learning Home Based Southland Two will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Director Review &amp; Improvement Services<br>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>18 February 2019¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service¬†</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
