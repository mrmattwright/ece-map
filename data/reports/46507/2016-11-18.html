</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Go Bananas is a privately owned all-day education and care service located in Hamilton City. It is licensed for 100 children, including up to 25 children under two years of age. Its roll of 102, includes 28 MƒÅori children and a number of children from other nationalities. The centre's philosophy embraces aspects of the teachings of Reggio Emilia and the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. The centre opened in 2014 and a sister centre has recently opened in Rotokauri.</p><p>The centre is purpose-built and operates three age-based classrooms. The Bambino room caters for babies and toddlers, Piccolo for children from two years old and Scuola for children up to school age. The centre maintains a focus on providing healthy food for children prepared and cooked on site.</p><p>The centre is owned by the director, who maintains a strong interest, oversight and presence in the centre. There is a centre manager with many years of experience in early childhood education who takes responsibility for day-to-day operations. There is a head teacher in each room.</p><p>A well-qualified professional practice manager is responsible for overseeing the quality of teaching practice, and the induction and mentoring of teachers. An administrator contributes to the smooth running of centre operations. The service is committed to employing qualified teachers and supporting teachers in training. They also provide transport to and from the centre for children whose families would not otherwise be able to access the service.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for Go Bananas Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Go Bananas is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Children and families are welcomed into classrooms by teachers who know them well. Many families enjoy taking time to settle their children, share conversations with teachers about their children, and read the attractive and informative displays of children's participation in the programme. This contributes to a strong sense of belonging for families. Teachers are caring and focused on children's wellbeing. Children are resilient, confident to make choices and follow their interests. As a result of recent self-review and professional development, transitions and routines are flexible and responsive. This enables children to follow their interests and sustain their play. There is a good balance of teacher-directed and child-initiated play that includes times for group experiences as well as independent exploration.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are being cared for in a nurturing and stimulating environment. The head teacher skilfully models respectful, responsive practices that promote the physical and emotional wellbeing of children in this room. Babies and young children are encouraged to explore the well-resourced and interesting indoor and outdoor environments. This is contributing to their growing confidence and understanding of the world around them. The teaching team fosters warm and trusting relationships amongst adults and children. They encourage children to share and communicate with their friends and carefully maintain familiar routines from home. Breast feeding mothers are actively supported and encouraged. Teachers should continue to reflect on ways to display familiar links with home to further enhance babies' sense of belonging and their transitions into the centre.</p><p>Older children build early concepts of literacy and mathematics. They gain confidence in using different materials for writing and creative activities. They confidently engage in dramatic play, singing and dancing, and games, alongside teachers who actively participate with them. Cultural celebrations are held and reflect the nationalities of teachers and families in the centre. Some children and families benefit from teachers who are able to speak their home language. A well-planned transition-to-school focus includes lunch-box days, visits to the local school and building children's social and self-care skills. The curriculum is enriched by the inclusion of many events that promote health and safety, visits into the local community, and regular visits from a local librarian. It is now important for centre leaders to ensure that older children can access a wider range of materials and equipment throughout the day that is age appropriate and provides opportunities for children to extend and add complexity to their learning. This should enable the service to realise the intent of their philosophy which is to provide an environment that acts as 'the third teacher'.</p><p>Teachers recognise, value and integrate the cultures of all children. They demonstrate respect for tikanga MƒÅori, enjoy Matariki celebrations and include waiata, karakia mo te kai and basic te reo MƒÅori in daily routines. They understand the value of tuakana-teina and provide opportunities for siblings to play and learn together. Teachers and leaders have considered the Ministry of Education resource, <em>TƒÅtaiako,</em> as a way of increasing their understanding of culturally responsive practices. WhƒÅnau share information about their whakapapa and aspirations for children's learning and development. This is contributing to the success and mana of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO observed models of good teaching practices. These are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers engaging in rich learning conversations with children that promote oral language, thinking and problem solving skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies that foster children's confidence to explore, make mistakes and take risks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carefully listening to children and recognising their strengths, interests and dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working in positive partnership with specialist agencies to provide inclusive education for children with special needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers regularly plan for and document aspects of children's learning and share these with families and whƒÅnau through electronic portfolios, centre displays and individual portfolio books. These books are readily available to children and contribute to their developing concept of themselves as competent and confident learners. Teachers should continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation by reviewing and clarifying the purpose and content of individual portfolios of learning. Attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making more effective use of the valuable information provided by parents and whƒÅnau in planning for children as they transition into the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying a wider range of learning experiences and child voice in portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more clearly documenting children's progress and development over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In a relatively short time the service has established effective, sustainable systems and processes to govern and manage the centre. This is evident through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a clear and shared philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate policies guidelines and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>useful frameworks for strategic planning, self review and performance management that is guiding centre direction, and contributing to ongoing development and improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a collaborative and collegial staff who feel valued by centre leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular opportunities for staff professional development, mentoring and coaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>positive and respectful relationships with children and their families and whƒÅnau.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to build on the good practices in place, centre leaders should continue to review and refine:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning to include specific goals with measureable indicators and outcomes aligned to Ministry of Education expectations and the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the performance management system to more closely align with strategic goals, contribute to consistent and high-quality teaching practices across all classrooms and promote positive outcomes for all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the service continue to access professional learning and development opportunities to build on and embed teaching practices that reflect best practice and current theory and research in early childhood education.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Go Bananas Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Go Bananas Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>18 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
