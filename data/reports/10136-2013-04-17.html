<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Expressions Childcare is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Expressions Childcare is a well established centre in Papatoetoe that caters mainly for children over three years old. Although the centre currently has a small group of younger children enrolled, the service for toddlers is being phased out over the next two years.</p><p>In 2010 ERO commended the quality of interactions between teachers and children and the respect shown for children&rsquo;s cultures. Parents were actively encouraged to be involved in the centre and staff maintained strong links with the community. These practices continue to be positive features of the service.</p><p>Restructuring of management and personnel roles in 2012 has enhanced the financial viability of the centre. The owner remains committed to providing affordable early childhood education to lower income families. She has significantly extended the hours subsidised by the government, at no cost to families.</p><p>The centre philosophy is focused on developing children as individuals, recognising their strengths and interests and fostering respectful relationships.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and settled in the centre. They interact enthusiastically with each other and enjoy teachers&rsquo; involvement in their play. Children are familiar with routines and expectations, and know to ask adults when they need additional resources. Older children are learning to work collaboratively and share well during group games. They benefit from many community excursions, including transition visits to the local primary school. Tuakana/teina relationships with the small group of toddlers enable older children to model self-help skills and strategies so all children can develop as independent learners. Children are friendly, show a sense of belonging and wellbeing, and are proud of their cultures.</p><p>Teachers consistently support children&rsquo;s involvement in play. They encourage children to explore resources and frequently ask questions to prompt ideas and conversations. Teachers model respectful relationships and are responsive to children's interests. Their warm interactions with children are helping children to develop as confident communicators. Teachers integrate literacy and numeracy experiences in the context of children's play, but could enhance this provision with prompts and visual displays that celebrate children's interest in reading, writing and numbers. Teachers affirm all children in their cultural identities. They are planning professional development to further enhance their skills in te reo M&#257;ori to further extend ways in which the centre reflects New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p>Teachers have established very good relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau. They welcome family members to the centre and organise many excursions and events which families enthusiastically support. Parents and wider community contribute well to Matariki celebrations and some parents are beginning to share their child&rsquo;s home experiences in learning journals. A recent formal survey has enabled parents to give feedback about centre practices and confirms their satisfaction with the service. Parents particularly appreciate cultural aspects of the programme and the positive learning environment.</p><p>Teachers actively involve children in developing programme topics. Weekly meetings with children are opportunities for them to suggest excursions and/or share ideas about their interests. Teachers use this information to plan activities and identify interests for ongoing topics. Children&rsquo;s learning journals are attractive records of their centre experiences and teachers often analyse the learning they observe well. Teachers have scheduled whole-team professional development in 2013 to further strengthen their planning, evaluation and assessment strategies.</p><p>The owner has adopted a collaborative approach to centre management and operations. Regular meetings, a daily diary, and shared management of children&rsquo;s learning journals and the environment enable all teachers to contribute to centre development and decision-making. Working as a team, the owner and teachers reviewed and improved their centre philosophy in 2012. They are currently refining centre policies and procedures. Other formal self review is in the early stages of development and the owner recognises the need to continue developing strategic planning and the staff appraisal process.</p><p>The centre manager and ERO agree that next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the extent to which there are focused learning experiences for toddlers</li>
<li>extending the depth of learning challenges for older children</li>
<li>further refining self-review processes and strategic planning</li>
<li>extending the appraisal system to incorporate a process for the owner/manager.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Expressions Childcare Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices the centre manager should ensure teachers keep more specific records when monitoring sleeping children.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
