</table><p>Since the March 2014 ERO report, the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association (the association), has built their internal capacity to provide clear direction and targeted support for Kaiti and other playcentres in the association.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaiti Playcentre is one of eight early childhood centres administered by the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association which oversees governance operations. A board of governors provides guidance and support for members. A liaison officer is employed by the board to visit playcentres and monitor how centres are meeting legislative requirements.</p><p>The playcentre operates three mixed-age sessions weekly for a maximum of 30 children, including 15 children up to two years of age. Of the 14 children enrolled, seven identify as MƒÅori and most are under three years of age. A qualified teacher works alongside the parents to cooperatively provide the programme.</p><p>The March 2014 ERO report identified that significant improvement was needed particularly in the following: assessment, planning and evaluation; the integrated use of te reo MƒÅori in the curriculum; fostering children‚Äôs independence; strengthening the programme for older children; and internal evaluation. Key next steps were identified for the association which focused on ensuring the centre was effectively governed and managed.</p><p>Playcentre members and the board of governors at the association received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). The Playcentre Federation has also provided ongoing professional development related to the key next steps.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Playcentre members have made some progress in self review, group planning and in how they integrate te reo MƒÅori into the programme. They have participated in professional learning and development to further their understanding of self review and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Children engage in a play-based programme. A range of interesting learning experiences are provided for them, and adults work alongside following their interests. Children engage in sustained play.</p><p>Adults use a range of strategies to extend the conversations they have with children, whose vocabulary is supported through adults‚Äô use of descriptive language. There is a dedicated space in the centre for infants, that is safe and peaceful.</p><p>The March 2014 ERO report found that members needed to review the centre philosophy in relation to fostering children‚Äôs independence. At the time of this previous review there was limited documentation available to show the extent of this review.</p><p>Progress is evident in group planning, which takes a thematic approach and reflects and extends children‚Äôs emerging interests. A next step for members is to develop a shared understanding of school readiness for children and reflect this through the playcentre programme.</p><p>Children‚Äôs assessment information shows a connection to the planned programme but does not yet reflect an understanding of the individual child‚Äôs learning journey. This area continues to require ongoing development. Next steps should include assessment information clearly identifying the significant learning for the child and showing how members have responded to this interest.</p><p>The bicultural programme is developing. Some progress is evident in adults' use of te reo MƒÅori throughout the programme. Te ao MƒÅori is strongly evident. The association has identified that a next step for them is to provide more strategic guidance for playcentres in promoting success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori. ERO's evaluation affirms this planned development.</p><p>Members are now using spontaneous review to reflect on aspects of practice and inform ongoing changes. While some progress is evident, ongoing development is still required. Key next steps should include the association supporting members to further develop their understanding of the purpose and use of internal evaluation. Once this is understood, members should be supported to shift from reviewing what they do to evaluating how well practices support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Adults have an understanding of the implications of the changes required to meet the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>. The Playcentre Association has provided initial guidance in this area.</p><p>The board of governors demonstrates leadership in supporting playcentres in their understanding of legislative requirements. Monitoring of these in the playcentre has been supported through the appointment of a liaison officer. In addition the association, has developed:</p><ul>
<li>an operational manual which provides policy guidance for members</li>
<li>appointment procedures</li>
<li>a system for police vetting</li>
<li>an appraisal process for employees</li>
<li>an approach for reviewing and evaluating the services' guiding documents and ongoing developments.</li>
</ul><p>The association has identified a next step is to develop an internet safety policy. ERO agrees that social networking and appointment policies should also be developed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association should assist members to address the key next steps to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared understanding of school readiness and reflect this in the programme</li>
<li>deepen their understanding of the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to expand their te reo MƒÅori vocabulary and integrate this throughout the curriculum</li>
<li>build their understanding of the purpose and use of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>provide greater strategic direction for centres in prompting success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori</li>
<li>develop policies for social media and staff appointments.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the association support playcentre members to develop an action plan that outlines how they will address the key next steps identified in this report. ERO will monitor progress against the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaiti Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice:</p><ul>
<li>members should consistently follow the systems and processes that have been established to monitor health and safety requirements in the playcentre</li>
<li>the association should consistently undertake police vetting of possible employees prior to their commencement.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaiti Playcentre will be dependent on the progress the playcentre makes in relation to the action plan.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>18 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
