<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Rangitoto Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children and to sustain high quality performance.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Rangitoto Kindergarten in Mairangi Bay, Auckland operates as part of the North Auckland Kindergarten Association (NAKA), which provides a policy framework and good professional guidance for the teachers. An administrator, teacher aide and a parent support group also assist teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s hours of opening have changed. Each week they now operate a six hour day for three days and four and a half hours for two days. This change has enabled NAKA to increase the teaching team by two new staff members and to reduce the teacher child ratio from 1:15 to 1:10. The majority of teachers are long serving and all teachers are qualified and registered. Since the last ERO review, teachers have engaged in extensive professional learning and development (PLD). This PLD has had a positive impact on the curriculum and in building a strong team culture. Teachers continue to provide high quality learning opportunities for children.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The high quality programme for children is a combination of many factors and support systems working together to meet the children&rsquo;s individual needs. Effective management processes, highly professional teachers and strong professional leadership are features of the kindergarten. High quality programmes, learning environments and interactions between adults and children contribute to children&rsquo;s ongoing development and learning.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy is underpinned by teachers&rsquo; shared values and understandings of the educational approaches they provide for children. The strong community networks and relationships evident are key to sustaining effective partnerships at all levels of the kindergarten&rsquo;s operation.</p><p>Teachers reflect carefully on their professional practice. They make good use of observations to determine the effectiveness of the programme and improve outcomes for children. As a result, children are:</p><ul>
<li>confident and socially competent, able to enjoy their relationships with others and value being part of a group</li>
<li>initiators of their own learning, cooperative and independent learners</li>
<li>resourceful and expressive in their creativity, and actively engaged in investigation and sustained explorations</li>
<li>open to new experiences and challenges, are happy and have fun.</li>
</ul><p>Effective communication with families has resulted in strong relationships and partnerships between the kindergarten and home, giving children a greater sense of belonging. Parents support teachers in the programme through their active participation and contributions. Parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga are invited to share and celebrate their cultures, values, beliefs, and foods. This not only enriches the curriculum but also deepens children&rsquo;s and teachers&rsquo; understanding and appreciation of other cultures and their own.</p><p>Teachers continue to grow and strengthen their professional practice through extensive professional development. They are highly reflective and are lead by a collaborative and experienced head teacher who is focussed on improvement and progress.</p><p>The Teaching Services Manager (TSM) provides good liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. Through her regular visits she raises teachers&rsquo; awareness of Association services, documentation and expectations. Her feedback through head teacher appraisals and visits contribute to teachers&rsquo; internal review processes and their annual planning.</p><p>ERO acknowledges the comprehensive self-review undertaken by teachers about the promotion and implementation of bicultural practices within the programme. Teachers agreed that the next step is to identify the growth of bicultural practices in the kindergarten&rsquo;s strategic plan so that they increase their use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori over time.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rangitoto Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>13 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
