<a id="1-evaluation-of-te-whare-kohungahunga-o-y-tamariki" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 <span>Evaluation of Te Whare Kohungahunga o Y Tamariki</span></h2><h3>How well placed is Te Whare Kohungahunga o Y Tamariki to promote positive learning outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Whare Kohungahunga o Y Tamariki is located in the suburb of Kaiti in Gisborne. The centre is a bilingual early childhood service. It is a place to be, to live and to learn Māori. The whakatauāki states: “we build strong kids, strong families and strong communities.” The centre’s primary focus is to work effectively in partnership with its mainly Māori community and service their specific needs.</p><p>The centre opened in March 2008 and this is the first education review. The kaiako have established strong and meaningful relationships with its whānau and community of Kaiti. The organisation provides a range of community services and whānau are able to access these as required.</p><p>Most whānau and staff are related through whakapapa. The emphasis on whanaungatanga makes this centre a preferred place for all children and their whānau. Children are settled, happy and content.</p><p>The majority of kaiako are early childhood trained. Others are working towards gaining their qualification. A major focus of professional learning and development is growing staff capability in te reo Māori and strengthening relationships with each other and the wider community.</p><p>Since the centre opened management has experienced considerable staff turnover due to a number of factors. Over the last two years a number of routines have been reviewed resulting in a settled and a more structured approach to centre and staff management.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The governing body acknowledges Māori as tangata whenua and are committed to Te Tiriti ō Waitangi partnerships. Through the philosophy, the goals make reference to Te Tiriti ō Waitangi and success for Māori. The centre aligns its policies and practices to the organisation’s overall goals and strategic vision.</p><p>The kaiako team’s capacity and capability to lead and promote a learning environment that reflects bilingual and bicultural practices is a strength. There is a clear vision that sets direction for the quality of the programme. This vision:</p><ul>
<li>seeks to realise the potential of Māori children and their whānau</li>
<li>responds to a diverse group of children through providing good quality bilingual and bicultural programmes.</li>
</ul><p>The place of tangata whenua is acknowledged and supported throughout the centre practices and within the community.</p><p>Children lead the learning programme. Self initiated learning occurs because the environment and programme allows them to pursue their own interests and challenges. Kaiako recognise and respond to all opportunities that engage and extend children’s learning. Children are confident and competent learners.</p><p>Priority learners are well catered for within the centre. Multiple arrangements are made to ensure whānau and their children can access appropriate services.</p><p>Whānau are pleased with their children’s learning. Opportunities are provided for whānau input and kaiako are respect their views and opinions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A number of areas for centre consideration include:</p><ul>
<li>The integrated programme needs to consider the interests and needs of toddlers. Closer monitoring is needed to ensure resourcing is age appropriate and health and safety needs are well catered for.</li>
<li>Each child has an individual plan. These focus on a child’s interests and learning at the centre and home. In the plan, there is little or no acknowledgement of a child’s emerging interest and participation in the programme.</li>
<li>More analysis of children’s learning is required. Assessments currently describe children’s learning experiences or involvement in activities. Comments do not refer to what children know, what kaiako did to support their learning and what children did to demonstrate their understanding of new knowledge.</li>
<li>Programme evaluation needs improving. Currently programme evaluation describes the programme but does not evaluate how effectively the programme meets the needs of children or how it can be improved. Identifying next steps will inform future planning.</li>
<li>A policy and procedure document for transitions is needed to ensure there are consistent practices that support children to transition within the centre and outside the centre. Continuity, collaboration and communication are essential between the whānau, staff and the child’s next learning stage or school.</li>
<li>Kaiako are focused on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing self review. Clear decisions are needed to ensure self review projects are completed within agreed timelines and reported appropriately.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Whare Kohungahunga o Y Tamariki completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Whare Kohungahunga o Y Tamariki will be in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Māori (Te Uepū-ā-Motu)</p><p>18 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
