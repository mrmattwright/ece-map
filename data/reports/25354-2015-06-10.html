</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papatoetoe Footsteps Community Preschool is a purpose-built centre located next to the Papatoetoe Adventist Church. The preschool has a Christian based philosophy with an emphasis on providing for its diverse cultural community. It offers half-day and six-hour sessions. The Pond Room caters for children aged between 2 and approximately 3 ¬Ω years of age. The Beehive Room provides for older children up to 5 years of age. Children also access a shared outdoor area.</p><p>The centre is run by a charitable trust. A governance board oversees financial aspects of service operations. Daily management is the responsibility of a centre manager, supported by two lead teachers. All of the teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2012 report noted positive relationships and interactions between adults and children. It commented on the variety of curriculum experiences offered to children to promote their health, wellbeing and spiritual development. These remain positive features of the programme. ERO recommended that teachers refine programme planning, assessment and evaluation and strengthen partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau. ERO also recommended teachers improve transitions within the centre and on to school. The teaching team is committed to make ongoing improvements in these areas of their professional practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A calm and positive tone supports children to settle quickly into the programme. Children move between clearly defined areas of play that are attractively presented to invite exploration. They are confident to work alongside other children and talk about their experiences. Children sometimes participate in sustained, cooperative play.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô interactions with children are caring and respectful. They are alongside children and listen carefully to their thoughts and ideas. Teachers know individual children well and respect children‚Äôs diverse cultural backgrounds. They effectively support children‚Äôs developing social skills. The programme caters well for children with special educational requirements.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs Christian philosophy and values are well integrated into the programme. Teachers plan to further develop learning programmes that emerge from children‚Äôs interests, particularly in the Beehive Room. Programme planning systems make clear links with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Parent/teacher interviews are an opportunity for teachers and parents to share information and for parents to discuss their aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning. Parents/whƒÅnau also appreciate informal opportunities to talk with teachers about their children.</p><p>Children‚Äôs participation in the programme is attractively documented. Teachers skilfully identify the learning that happens in children‚Äôs play. They could more clearly show children‚Äôs learning and progress over time and evaluate group programmes to identify improved learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is committed to developing practices that reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Teachers are using resources to help them increase the use of te reo MƒÅori during group times. They could also incorporate more te reo MƒÅori in their spontaneous interactions with children. Reviewing the centre philosophy and developing a long-term goal to reflect the centre-wide focus on biculturalism and te reo MƒÅori are appropriate next steps.</p><p>Teachers are currently strengthening their support for children and families to settle into the centre, move between the two rooms and onto school. Centre leaders report the improved transition practices have benefitted children from diverse cultural groups, particularly those from Pacific Island nations. ERO‚Äôs 2012 report noted that supporting children to develop inquiry skills could better prepare them for school. Centre leaders recognise that they could use recent research and current theory to review the centre‚Äôs ‚Äòschool readiness‚Äô programme.</p><p>The centre manager provides effective leadership. She works collaboratively with the lead teachers to promote team approaches. Staff are focused on continuous improvement. Teacher appraisals provide opportunities for teachers to reflect on and develop their practices. Professional development is supporting teachers to strengthen self-review systems. Leaders agree that it would be useful to evaluate the impact of change on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The governance board has a good understanding of trustees‚Äô roles and responsibilities. Operational systems are efficient, including the management of privacy requirements. A parent committee contributes their perspectives to the overall management of the centre. The board is currently reviewing the centre‚Äôs strategic plan. Revisiting and adding to the plan annually could enable them to maintain a long-term vision for the centre‚Äôs future direction and ongoing development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to review and improve transition practices, particularly the ‚Äòschool readiness‚Äô programme</li>
<li>increasing the visibility of the centre‚Äôs commitment to bicultural development</li>
<li>following up on identified next learning steps to show children‚Äôs progress over time</li>
<li>using self review to evaluate how the programme and teaching practices improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papatoetoe Footsteps Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papatoetoe Footsteps Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
