</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kilbirnie Community Creche provides education and care for 20 preschool children, including five up to two years of age. An advisory committee of elected parents governs the centre. The day-to-day running is the responsibility of the manager and senior teacher. The creche philosophy of children learning most effectively through a ‚Äòself-choice‚Äô approach continues to guide practice. There is a strong focus on partnership with parents and the local community.</p><p>The teaching team is experienced and well established. The March 2012 ERO report identified several areas for development and review. Management and teachers were highly responsive to suggestions in the report. They drew up a deliberate action plan that is regularly reviewed and discussed. Consequently, all areas for review and development have been addressed. The centre has a good reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers use their knowledge of children to ensure that the curriculum is responsive to their strengths and interests. They demonstrate respectful, sensitive and nurturing interactions. Teachers encourage children to develop their independence, problem-solve and take risks as they learn. Children have plenty of choice in their play, reflecting centre philosophy. Teachers and children have fun learning together. Teachers model quiet, calm and respective relationships. The physical environment offers a variety of challenges to encourage children‚Äôs exploration.</p><p>Assessment, in the form of learning stories, focuses on learning attitudes or dispositions. Connections are made within and between assessment records. Children‚Äôs progress is shown over time and the development of learning is demonstrated. Their language, culture and identity are intentionally reflected. Planning is informed by assessment and session evaluations. Records of children‚Äôs learning are in individual portfolios or displayed on centre walls. Te reo MƒÅori is deliberately incorporated throughout assessment, planning and evaluation. Documentation of children‚Äôs learning includes the use of te reo MƒÅori. This is a feature of the centre.</p><p>A bicultural perspective is strong and highly visible. A recent focus for self review and professional learning and development has been about ways to promote success for MƒÅori children. Managers and teachers continue to explore and define what success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori means at their centre. Staff have revisited their philosophy and made links to strategic planning and appraisal. Teachers have engaged with whƒÅnau to improve their knowledge of tikanga MƒÅori. The planned use of the Ministry of Education resources, <em>Ka Hikitia:</em> <em>Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017 and TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> is likely to further enrich the curriculum.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop their understanding of mathematics concepts through authentic learning experiences. Te reo MƒÅori is successfully interwoven through literacy and numeracy learning.</p><p>Children up to two years of age learn in a secure, calm environment where teachers and older peers support them to make choices and master their own physical development. Affirming relationships between teachers, children and their families promote the development of children‚Äôs positive sense of self and belonging. Young children access a varied and flexible outdoor environment.</p><p>A performance management system for teachers has been developed since the previous ERO report. The process aligns teachers' goals to centre priorities and the Registered Teacher Criteria. Providing evidence of progress towards goals should strengthen the process and further contribute to teachers‚Äô development.</p><p>Self review is evaluative and includes indicators for desired practice. Well-considered strategic planning guides ongoing development and change.</p><p>The centre manager and senior teacher work collaboratively to guide teaching and learning. Positive outcomes for all children are consistently promoted.</p><p>The committee is well informed and supported by the centre manager. They effectively guide centre operation through well-developed systems and processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>deciding and documenting curriculum priorities that reflect the unique culture of the centre and the shared values and beliefs</li>
<li>reviewing the centre's effectiveness in meeting these priorities</li>
<li>teachers using evidence to show how they are meeting requirements in their appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kilbirnie Community Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kilbirnie Community Creche will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>17 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
