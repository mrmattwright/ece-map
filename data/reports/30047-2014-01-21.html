</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Lil Pumpkins Preschool Centre Limited is a privately owned centre located in the Glenview suburb of Hamilton. The centre provides education and care for children from three months to school age in two age-based rooms. It is licensed for 30 children, including five under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review the centre‚Äôs roll was 30, including 11 children who identify as MƒÅori.</p>
<p>Since the 2011 ERO review there has been a change in centre leadership and some changes in the teaching staff. The centre owner provides overall governance for the centre. The company manager provides professional guidance for the centre supervisor and teachers, and oversees centre administration. Four of the seven teachers at the centre are fully qualified early childhood teachers. The centre has a positive ERO reporting history and centre leaders have responded positively to the areas for review and development in the 2011 ERO review about strengthening partnerships with families. At the beginning of 2013 the centre was relicensed by the Ministry of Education under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>.</p>
<p>The centre philosophy makes a commitment to providing learning experiences that allow children to become confident and competent learners with a positive sense of identity and mana. Its curriculum is intended to reflect the principles of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and the Reggio Emilia philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The centre owner promotes positive outcomes for children by maintaining very good teacher-to-child ratios and a well-resourced learning environment. In consultation with staff and the company manager, she has developed a comprehensive strategic plan to guide centre development. A useful policy and procedures framework informs centre operations. These are regularly reviewed in consultation with parents and teachers.</p>
<p>The recently appointed centre supervisor is providing good quality leadership for teachers and children. She models effective teaching practice and has already established a collaborative team culture among teachers. The knowledgeable and experienced company manager provides high-quality support and professional guidance for the supervisor and teachers. The strong emphasis placed on building and supporting effective teaching practices, has been enhanced by implementing more robust teacher appraisal processes.</p>
<p>Children participate in a programme that provides them with many opportunities to explore and follow their interests. Teachers effectively integrate literacy and mathematics learning into children‚Äôs play and at set-group times. Children enjoy regular excursions into the local community. The programme is enhanced by parents and members of the wider community frequently sharing their knowledge and expertise with children. An increased emphasis on te reo, tikanga and te ao MƒÅori has strengthened the identity and sense of belonging of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau at the centre. A specific programme for older children supports their readiness for school by focussing on small group skills, number recognition and aspects of literacy.</p>
<p>Teachers have established strong partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. They keep parents well informed about their children‚Äôs participation in the programme and learning through regular conversations and attractively presented individual portfolios. Centre celebrations and special events are well attended by parents and members of the wider community.</p>
<p>Toddlers benefit from respectful, responsive and nurturing care. Consistent care giving supports their need to form strong and secure attachments. Toddlers also have good opportunities to interact with, and learn alongside their older siblings and peers.</p>
<p>Teachers‚Äô interactions and relationships with children are positive and affirming. They skilfully foster development of children‚Äôs social skills and oral language. Children with diverse needs experience an environment that caters well for their emotional and learning needs. The spacious outdoor play areas offer a wide variety of physical challenge and many opportunities for imaginative play. Attractively presented wall displays celebrate children‚Äôs creativity and learning.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>review and strengthen current assessment and planning processes to support teachers to more consistently notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests and learning</li>
<li>access centre-wide professional learning for teachers on the Reggio Emilia philosophy to build a shared understanding of how to implement this in the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lil Pumpkins Preschool Centre Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Lil Pumpkins Preschool Centre Limited will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
