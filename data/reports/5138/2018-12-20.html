</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Deanwell Kindergarten located in Hamilton, is licensed for 40 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care to children from two years to school age. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is an additional language. At the time of this ERO review 43 children were enrolled, including 11 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòOur children are strong in heart, head and hand‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumƒÅtua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the WKA are involved in a ‚ÄòCool for School‚Äô transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato Under 5 Energise. The kindergarten's education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy focuses on providing a high-quality learning environment that encourages children to play, explore and have fun. Priority is placed on empowering children to be confident and competent learners and fostering their self esteem and independence. The kindergarten believes in the importance of working in partnership and having respectful, responsive and reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2014 there have been several changes to the leadership team. A new head teacher and education services manager (ESM) were recently appointed. The kindergarten achieved Bronze Enviroschools status and a Healthy Heart award. A new garden area was developed in consultation with children, parents and local iwi. The kindergarten has also extended its operating hours to meet the needs of the community.</p><p>The kindergarten has responded well to the areas identified in the previous ERO report. This review was part of a cluster of three kindergarten reviews in the WKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's languages and cultures are highly visible and valued. Teachers naturally integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into the programme. Bicultural learning opportunities acknowledge the unique place of MƒÅori in New Zealand society. A positive relationship with a kaumƒÅtua enriches connections to local iwi. Families from other diverse cultures are encouraged to share their own languages and customs, and special events acknowledge and celebrate cultural diversity. MƒÅori and other children experience a strong sense of belonging in an inclusive family-based environment.</p><p>Teachers deliberatively foster children's social competence and self-management skills through positive and caring relationships. A newly established approach to individualised planning is supporting collaboration with parents and positive partnerships for learning. Further alignment of teaching practices to individual planning should strengthen children's ability to lead their own learning through complex and challenging tasks. Children with additional learning and behavioural needs are well supported and there is effective liaison with external agencies. A focus on improving oral language supports English language learners. The curriculum is enhanced through a variety of trips, experiences and visitors to the kindergarten. Children's literacy and mathematical learning is supported through authentic contexts for learning.</p><p>Leadership is collaborative and fosters a positive team culture. New leaders have developed high levels of relational trust amongst staff. Open communication enables parents and families to feel welcome and listened to. A strategic approach to strengthening partnerships between the kindergarten and local school is supporting positive transitions and learning pathways. Internal evaluation is used effectively to inform change and improve outcomes for learners.</p><p>The ESM works closely with the head teacher and provides well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operation. The WKA has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further strengthen the implementation of individualised planning to add challenge and complexity to children‚Äôs learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the environment to increase opportunities for children to lead their own learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy and formalise the kindergarten‚Äôs local curriculum, in consultation with parents, whƒÅnau and community.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Deanwell Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Deanwell Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
