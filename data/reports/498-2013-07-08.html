<h3>What are the important features of this school that have an impact on student learning?</h3>
<p>Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu (Te Kura) is a large national provider of distance education for children and young people in the early childhood, compulsory and post-compulsory years. Over time, the roll has become more diverse and enrolment is governed by the Ministry of Education's enrolment policy. Many of the students are referred by the Ministry of Education because they have not been able to succeed at their local school. There is an increasing number of adult learners enrolling with Te Kura.</p>
<p>Sixty-one percent of the current students are now in the at-risk category: alienated or excluded from a face-to-face school; referred because they have psychological or psycho-social needs; young parents; and students referred by Child, Youth and Family. About 5% of full time and dual-enrolled students have special education needs. MƒÅori students make up about one third of the roll and these students are less likely to remain on the roll for a full year, participate fully in learning or complete qualifications. This review focuses on student engagement, progress and achievement, particularly for those students less well served by our education system.</p>
<p>Te Kura has a new board of trustees, appointed by the Minister of Education in October 2012. Strategic goals in the 2013 Charter reflect Te Kura‚Äôs established aim to promote improved student outcomes. The board chairperson has confirmed the board‚Äôs determination to focus on lifting students‚Äô participation and achievement in education, in support of the Government‚Äôs Better Public Services targets.</p>
<p>The board reports some progress in its strategic initiatives since the November 2009 ERO report. Developments include regionalising the organisation to enable more face-to-face engagement with students, extending learning pathways for senior students through real-life learning and improving learning partnerships with dual enrolment schools and providers. School leaders are able to show improvements for some students as a result of these initiatives.</p>
<p>While Te Kura has maintained development in line with its strategic plan, overall progress in some areas has been affected by major work to implement a new electronic student management system (SMS) and update all course materials for National Certificates in Educational Achievement (NCEA). An additional factor has been the need to manage resources carefully through a period of financial constraints.</p>
<p>ERO reviews between 2007 and 2009 identified a number of continuing concerns that needed to be addressed. These were about low participation and achievement, particularly for MƒÅori students, the suitability of the learning model for many students, and the use of evidence in evaluating the effectiveness of practices and initiatives. ERO‚Äôs findings in this review indicate that these areas continue to be of serious concern.</p>
<p>A review by the Ministry of Education in 2012, in conjunction with Te Kura, provided a range of scenarios for students currently underserved by the education system. Discussion continues with the Ministry to determine the pathway forward. ERO agrees that traditional distance education on its own is not an appropriate model for learners at risk.</p>
<a id="2-learning" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Learning</h2>
<h3>How well does this school use achievement information to make positive changes to learners‚Äô engagement, progress and achievement?</h3>
<p>The school is starting to use achievement information better to improve outcomes for every learner. The school leaders acknowledged that they needed to analyse the information more closely to identify success rates for students who enrol through different gateways and who work with different providers. This work has begun. The new SMS system has the capacity to enable them to do that. The school is developing better systems for managing the quality of practices for senior assessment to meet New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) requirements.</p>
<p>There is a consistent pattern of low engagement and achievement for students considered most at risk. Many of these students are MƒÅori. The school‚Äôs self-review information indicates that the distance delivery model may not suit the majority of students who lack motivation, engagement and independent learning skills, and who work in ill-equipped learning environments. Many are not easily able to understand and use the resources on their own. Face-to-face learning opportunities are offered, but the most at-risk students are less likely to attend.</p>
<p>It is difficult to make an overall judgement about the extent of student progress and achievement due to the complex nature of the roll. Many students are on the roll for a short time and senior students, including young adults, may not be attempting a full course. In addition, the transition to the new student management system limited the ability of curriculum leaders to use assessment information effectively during 2012. The school has reported against National Standards on the achievement of full time students in Years 1 to 8. Results were variable and did not provide convincing evidence of progress over time. Years 7 to 10 follow an integrated curriculum, Te Ara Hou. Limited information was available about overall engagement and progress for these students. The school has set a target in the 2013 Charter to report on the progress of students with special education needs against their individual learning goals.</p>
<p>The school reported an overall decline in participation and achievement in NCEA from 2009-2011. Significant numbers of students in Year 11 and above do not gain credits in the course of a year. For those students enrolled in a full time course and completing course requirements, success rates show small improvements. Analysis of the provisional 2012 results was in progress during the onsite stage of the ERO review. The school's final analysis shows that overall pass rates for participating students, particularly full time and young adult students, are continuing to improve along with the proportion of merit and excellence endorsements. Fewer results were reported overall, due to a small decrease in the roll, changes to literacy and numeracy requirements and the removal of some mathematics unit standards.</p>
<p>Some students, including learners who were previously at risk of not engaging in education, are very well served by Te Kura. Teachers are able to identify examples of individual success across the school. These students benefit from the individualised programmes. They are able to work independently at their own pace and access on-line and paper course materials that meet their learning needs. Factors that appear to support their progress are:</p>
<ul><li>effective supervision (home or other provider)</li>
<li>supportive and well-resourced learning environments</li>
<li>students setting relevant, specific goals for learning</li>
<li>teachers adapting teaching materials in response to students‚Äô interests and providing authentic contexts for learning</li>
<li>effective relationships among student, whƒÅnau, learning advisor and teachers</li>
<li>teachers tracking and monitoring students‚Äô progress and providing useful feedback on learning.</li>
</ul><p>The increased accessibility of staff in the regions has had a positive impact on the engagement in learning of some students because there are now:</p>
<ul><li>more opportunities for face-to-face contact with learning advisors and teachers</li>
<li>improved relationships with other education and social service providers</li>
<li>opportunities for greater engagement with iwi and whƒÅnau.</li>
</ul><a id="3-curriculum" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Curriculum</h2>
<h3>How effectively does this school‚Äôs curriculum promote and support student learning?</h3>
<p>Te Kura has some challenges in providing a curriculum that effectively promotes and supports learning for every student.</p>
<p>Curriculum reviews and reports do not provide robust evaluation of how well the school‚Äôs curriculum promotes student learning. There are limited guidelines that explain how the school‚Äôs curriculum reflects the principles, vision and values expressed in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>. It is not clear what effective pedagogy (teaching and learning) or e-learning looks like in practice in a distance learning environment. Teachers do not have a shared understanding of Te Kura‚Äôs curriculum.</p>
<p>Some recent developments have made the curriculum more responsive to the needs of its diverse student groups. Digitising resources means that some students can access the resource immediately rather than waiting for the paper resources. Increasing numbers of subject teachers are developing online teaching and learning programmes that enable students to share ideas and work, and get more immediate feedback from teachers and peers.</p>
<p>ERO noted examples of effective practice where teachers are committed to interacting with students in advisory sessions and in a distance context. Teachers monitor each student‚Äôs presence and the contacts made with them, particularly for priority learners. There is an expectation that teachers will have individual conversations with full time students about their interests, learning goals and possible pathways. This practice is resulting in some students engaging in more authentic learning, for example, in workplaces, through Te Kura Trades Academy and other training organisations.</p>
<p>Where schools or other providers give high levels of support for dual-enrolled students, better outcomes have been achieved. Te Kura has developed a revised service agreement with schools and other providers using the dual-enrolment pathways for 2013. This makes it clear that the provider is responsible for supervising students and providing a properly resourced learning environment, including broadband, to support digital delivery. Relationship coordinators now provide better liaison between the provider and Te Kura.</p>
<h3>Areas for review and development</h3>
<p><strong>Self review.</strong> Internal evaluation does not yet provide an effective basis for ongoing improvement of the quality of education. This is because:</p>
<ul><li>expected outcomes of strategies are not clear</li>
<li>evidence is not used well to evaluate effectiveness</li>
<li>reports and reviews note actions and activities, rather than consideration of the impact of these actions.</li>
</ul><p>In order to promote organisational learning, planning for initiatives should include a clear rationale, an evaluation plan and a cost-benefit analysis so that the outcomes can be carefully evaluated and the subsequent learning shared across the school.</p>
<p><strong>E-learning.</strong> The school‚Äôs e-learning strategy is not clear to or well understood by all staff. In order to support this development, leaders need to implement:</p>
<ul><li>a clear strategy for developing digital education</li>
<li>guidelines and expectations for e-learning pedagogies</li>
<li>consistent access to computers and the technologies needed for learning for full time and dual-enrolled students.</li>
</ul><h3>How effectively does the school promote educational success for MƒÅori, as MƒÅori?</h3>
<p>A high proportion of MƒÅori students enrolling at Te Kura are already at risk, as they have disengaged from mainstream schooling. Regional planning focuses on building staff capability in promoting educational success for MƒÅori, as MƒÅori. Some specific actions have been taken to support MƒÅori students to achieve success, such as, closer tracking and individual interviews. ERO observed some examples of better engagement and positive learning relationships, particularly in local MƒÅori contexts. Although some students are beginning to gain success, the school has not been able to engage the majority of MƒÅori students effectively in the programmes offered. Educational achievement is lower for MƒÅori students than other students throughout the school. The 2012 NCEA results show however, that MƒÅori students entered for standards are achieving a higher level than non-MƒÅori.</p>

<h3>How well placed is the school to sustain and improve its performance?</h3>
<p>The organisation has an overall focus on raising achievement, one learner at a time. It will be better placed to sustain developments in the future if it can improve its capacity through:</p>
<ul><li>focusing on improving achievement for all learners, particularly those who are most vulnerable</li>
<li>effective planning and evaluation processes that contribute to improved performance</li>
<li>committing to full implementation and review of strategic priorities</li>
<li>better communication of the vision and direction so that all staff become committed to purposeful change.</li>
</ul><p>Robust performance improvement processes are needed to ensure that Te Kura is better placed to sustain and improve its performance. The board was not able to provide evidence that the chief executive was appraised effectively in 2012. No performance measures were set, evidence was not gathered from key stakeholders and an assessment of performance was not tabled for the board. The current board has established a performance agreement and an appraisal process for 2013.</p>
<p>Evidence from staff surveys during the past three years indicates that there are some issues around staff culture and low levels of morale. The board is continuing to address these issues and intends to conduct another staff engagement survey in 2013.</p>
<h3>Provision for Early Childhood Education [ECE]</h3>
<p>The early childhood service continues to be well placed to promote positive outcomes for children and families. The service supports the government‚Äôs goals for increasing participation in early childhood education for priority learners, including those who have limited access to an early childhood centre.</p>
<p>Factors that contribute to the success of the ECE team are:</p>
<ul><li>collaborative leadership and effective mentoring and support for early childhood staff</li>
<li>development of the MƒÅori dimension within the curriculum through the leadership of the MƒÅori curriculum committee</li>
<li>a buddy teaching approach that provides opportunities for professional dialogue, raises the quality of practice and better supports children and their families</li>
</ul><p>well developed self review that leads to ongoing improvements in practice.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education funded playgroup initiative has increased participation for families at risk, aligning with public sector targets. A trust, visited as part of this review, reported that the quality of resources and professional development provided by Te Kura are significant factors in sustaining these playgroups.</p>
<h3>Board assurance on legal requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the board of trustees and principal of the school completed the ERO Board Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklists. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>board administration</li>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>management of health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial management</li>
<li>asset management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on student achievement:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety of students (including prevention of bullying and sexual harassment)</li>
<li>physical safety of students</li>
<li>teacher registration</li>
<li>processes for appointing staff</li>
<li>stand-downs, suspensions, expulsions and exclusions</li>
<li>attendance.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendations to other agencies</h3>
<p>There needs to be an increased sense of urgency about addressing the low levels of engagement and achievement among priority learners: MƒÅori; Pacific; and students unengaged and underserved in mainstream schooling, including those with special education needs. These at-risk learners need appropriate resources, individual support and 21st century learning environments. Local community solutions, perhaps involving Te Kura in partnership with other providers, agencies and iwi are likely to provide better wrap-around support for these learners.</p>
<p>The issues related to at-risk learners raised in this report are the responsibility of the whole education sector, not just Te Kura.</p>
<p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education consider:</p>
<ul><li>setting up a clear policy framework for meeting the needs of excluded, alienated and at risk students, including better cross-agency collaboration to support these students</li>
<li>reviewing gateways to enrolment in Te Kura to ensure that those students who enrol and continue to be enrolled are able to benefit from the distance learning model and achieve success in their learning</li>
<li>reviewing the effectiveness of policies that relate to special education provision in mainstream schools, in light of the numbers of students who do not appear to transition to full inclusion.</li>
</ul><h3>When is ERO likely to review the school again?</h3>
<p>Given that the issues related to at-risk learners raised in this report are the responsibility of the whole education sector, ERO will continue to work with Te Kura and the Ministry of Education to support the changes discussed and recommended and will determine the timing of the next ERO review of Te Kura following this process.</p>
