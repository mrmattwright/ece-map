</table><p>ABC Parkside is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Parkside operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart is a large organisation that owns education centres across New Zealand.</p><p>The centre is licensed for full-day education and care for up to 50 children, including up to 16 under the age of two years. The centre is purpose-built and is located near an adult community college.</p><p>Children in the nursery and preschool have separate indoor and outdoor areas, with clear visibility for children between all areas.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, there have been significant changes in the centre's leadership. Good progress has been made in the identified next steps from the 2015 review. This includes a review of the philosophy and aligning it to the centre's vision and strategic goals. Children's thoughts and contributions are considered in decision making in programme planning and parents contribute to this learning.</p><p>The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations. There are two head teachers, with responsibility for the nursery and preschool areas. A BestStart business manager and professional services manager visit regularly to support the centre manager and teachers.</p><p>The staff comprises a mix of qualified and registered teachers and teachers in training.</p><p>Children come from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Families travel from within and beyond the local community to attend the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have reviewed the centre's philosophy. This is helping the new team to develop a shared belief in teaching practices and priorities that support children's learning. The values of respect, responsibility and relationships guide teachers' practices and the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers recognise the importance of children learning through play. The environment is thoughtfully organised, responsive to children's interests and encourages active exploration. Natural materials and resources are easy for children to access and support imaginative and creative play. Children's learning is extended through links to the local and wider community. Teachers facilitate opportunities for children to take responsibility for their own learning with respect and care for the environment and others. Mixed-age groupings encourage older children to engage with and support younger children and to enjoy tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have easy access to a range of activities and play spaces which are well resourced and which invite participation. Teachers maintain a calm pace which gives younger children space and time to lead their learning. Teachers are responsive to children's needs and interests.</p><p>Children's transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well supported by positive and supportive relationships between the centre, families and schools. Decisions on transition timeframes are flexible and responsive to the individual needs of each child and family.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed good links with external support specialists and agencies. Children with identified needs are nurtured and well supported in their learning.</p><p>Children experience aspects of MƒÅori language and culture. There are processes in place to strengthen practice and further integrate MƒÅori perspectives into assessment and programme planning.</p><p>Assessment information shows that teachers know children's interests, progress and learning goals. Parents' wishes for their children are sought and planning shows how these are incorporated into the curriculum. Teachers regularly share information with parents/whƒÅnau about children's learning both in electronic form, and in individual profile books and informative wall displays.</p><p>The strategic and annual plan effectively guides the centre's operations. Centre leaders follow a useful process of internal evaluation for planned and spontaneous reviews. Some reviews have led to positive outcomes for children.</p><p>There are supportive governance policies and procedures in place for leaders and teachers. The professional services manager and business manager provide effective guidance to the centre manager to ensure the efficient operation of the centre. The centre manager actively promotes teacher reflection through regular one-on-one meetings. Leaders and teachers have opportunities to participate in internal and external targeted professional learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The BestStart managers and centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to continue building on good practices are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement changes as a result of the philosophy review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build a culture of intentional and reflective teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and embed the cultural identity and perspectives for MƒÅori children into assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen and embed the understanding of effective evaluative thinking, practice and teacher inquiry across the teaching team.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Parkside completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Parkside will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>26 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
