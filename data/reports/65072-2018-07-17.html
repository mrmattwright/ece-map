</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Templeton Nursery and Preschool is a privately-owned centre providing care and education for infants, toddlers and children to school age. It is licensed for 52 children, including up to 13 children aged under two. A centre manager oversees the daily operation of the centre. Most staff are registered early childhood teachers. The centre is one of two centres owned by the same service provider. The other centre is Estuary Road Preschool.</p><p>The buildings and learning environment have been significantly improved since the 2015 ERO review. Infants and toddlers now have easy access from the indoor nursery environment to the outdoor play area. The preschool room has been extensively renovated and has its own outdoor play area.</p><p>There have been many staff changes in the last 18 months. This has included the appointment of a new centre manager. Following the 2015 ERO review, the owner, centre leaders, and teachers received ongoing Ministry of Education support and participated in professional development. However, due to the significant staff changes many of the current teachers were not part of the professional learning opportunities provided at that time. Staff changes have impacted on the rate of progress that the centre has made in regard to some areas identified in the 2015 ERO review. Centre leaders have been placing an appropriate emphasis on a professional team culture with new staff.</p><p>The centre is an active member of a learning cluster with other early childhood services and schools in the Hornby area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers have undertaken a useful philosophy review. This has supported teachers to more clearly identify the learning they value for children, and these values inform their daily practices and curriculum. Valued learning includes a sense of belonging, respect, being life-long learners, play, biculturalism, responsibility, and partnerships.</p><p>Teachers purposefully set up the learning environments and programme in ways that support children's current play interests and extend the centre‚Äôs valued learning outcomes for children. Infants, toddlers and children have good access to a range of play equipment and adequate spaces to use resources in a variety of interesting and creative ways. Teachers review the environment and ensure it is set up in ways that promote interactions between children and supports children‚Äôs social play. Children have choices about their involvement in routines throughout the day which creates opportunities for sustained in-depth play.</p><p>Teachers plan intentionally to support individual children's learning. Teachers regularly notice what children are interested in and their attitudes to learning. Teachers place emphasis on supporting children's relationships, and communication. They are also particularly aware of children's belonging and wellbeing, especially when infants, toddlers and children are settling into the centre. They are currently reviewing assessment, planning and evaluation practices and implementing more consistent systems.</p><p>Records of learning and display boards provide useful information to parents about children's learning, the curriculum, and the centre's developing responsiveness to Te Ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have regularly used emergent evaluations to make well-considered changes to some centre practices and the environment. They maintain good records of their reflections and outcomes of changes to practice. A systematic process is well embedded for policy review. Due to staff changes the current teachers have yet to undertake an in-depth internal evaluation.</p><p>The centre owner and manager have developed well-focused strategic and long-term planning that appropriately identifies priorities for improvement. They model and promote collaborative leadership to support centre improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has made some progress in regard to the next steps identified in the 2015 ERO review but this progress has been affected by the recent staff changes.</p><p>ERO has identified, and the centre owner and centre manager agree, that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>successfully embed new assessment, planning and evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the curriculum and teacher's understandings to reflect Te WhƒÅriki 2017</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build bicultural practices and ways to acknowledge children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen all teachers' understanding and use of internal evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal, including a clearer process for centre managers and teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO will work with the service provider in regard to following up the progress the centre is making against these key next steps.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Templeton Nursery and Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>ERO identified areas of non-compliance.</h3><p>The service provider must ensure that physical sleep checks are carried out and sleep records are consistently completed.<br>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres, 2008.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that appraisals of staff in teaching positions are based on current professional standards for teachers established by the Education Council for the issuing and renewal of practising teaching certificates.<br>Education Act 1989, Part 31</p><p>ERO also identified that some health and safety documentation wasn't consistently completed by teachers. To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should strengthen health and safety documentation and systems for monitoring and ensuring that practices are correctly implemented and recorded.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Templeton Nursery and Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>18 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
