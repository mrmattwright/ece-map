</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids World Childcare Limited is a privately owned early childhood centre situated in Bulls. The centre provides education and care for up to 49 children, including 15 children up to two years of age. Since the February 2015 report there have been several changes of staff particularly in the playschool. In December 2015 the centre changed ownership.</p><p>The centre is made up of a playschool, which provides education and care for infants and toddlers. Two qualified teachers and a teacher assistant have recently been appointed. The pre-school is for the older children and there is a stable teaching team in this area. They are located in separate premises on the same site and each have their own playgrounds.</p><p>The centre has a variable reporting history with ERO. The previous ERO review found that significant development was required in: the quality of teacher interactions; promoting educational success for MƒÅori; self review (including a focus on philosophy); assessment, planning and evaluation; teachers' understanding of best practice; strategic planning; and leadership.</p><p>After the February 2015 ERO report the teaching team, under previous ownership, received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). However, ERO has concerns about the extent of progress made and limited documentation was available to show the impact of any changes made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Since the new owners took over in December 2015, the learning environment has been developed. A dedicated infant space has been created and physical changes to the environment have been undertaken to purposefully promote children‚Äôs independence. Additional children's resources have been purchased.</p><p>A philosophy review has occurred at teacher level only. This should be reviewed in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau to ensure that it reflects the centre's community. When this process is complete a next step is for leaders and teachers to collectively determine what best practice looks like for the curriculum. Indicators of good practice will be useful in informing internal evaluation, future decisions, appointments and teacher appraisal.</p><p>Insufficient evidence was available to show progress made in the quality of teaching. Observations undertaken by ERO of teacher practice showed teachers interacted warmly with children and responded to their requests. In the playschool, teachers worked alongside children in adult-led activities that were of interest to children. A key next step is for these teachers to develop understandings of high quality practice when working with children up to three years of age. This should also include a strong focus on designing a responsive curriculum.</p><p>In the pre-school area, children are able to choose who they participate with and where. They had free access to indoor and outside areas and were observed to engage in sustained play. Teachers were respectful in their interactions with children.</p><p>A bicultural programme is developing and has a stronger emphasis in the pre-school setting. This aspect of the programme requires strengthening and greater integration across the curriculum. There is limited strategic direction for promoting educational success for MƒÅori. This needs to be a priority. Once established this should be used to build teacher confidence and guide appropriate practice.</p><p>Currently there are two models of assessment, planning and evaluation used by teachers. It is timely for the centre's programme planning policy to be reviewed to reflect the agreed practice. This approach should also include a stronger focus on promoting learning partnerships with parents. Once established, this policy should provide sufficient direction for teachers and guide implementation of assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Because of the changes to staffing in the playschool, professional learning and development has been targeted to the pre-school area. The focus has been on building teachers' understanding of good quality assessment practice. At the time of this review, a full planning cycle had not been completed. The evidence available does show that teachers are analysing significant learning in more depth and using this to plan for the child's learning and ongoing development. Although teachers have shown considerable commitment to this approach, leaders should now consider the manageability and sustainability for the long-term use of this current process.</p><p>The framework, notice, recognise and respond, is in the very early stages of development in the playschool area.</p><p>The recently introduced appraisal system is focused on building teacher confidence and trust. The process needs significant development to ensure a robust approach to performance management. The new approach should increase a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teaching practice that improves outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alignment with strategic direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observations of teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers demonstrating how they meet Practising Teacher Criteria and developing cultural competencies through an evidential portfolio.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new owners plan to introduce the appraisal process and induction and mentoring programme used in their other services. Monitoring of effective implementation of appraisal should occur over time.</p><p>Previous leaders participated in professional learning and development to build leadership capabilities. As a result of staff changes and centre ownership improvement has not been sustained. A new team leader in the playschool and acting centre manager have since been appointed in 2016. As a direct result of these changes, ongoing support is required to define and build leadership.</p><p>The previous owners engaged in professional development for strategic planning. However, new owners have decided not to continue with this model and will implement their own. Manageable and sustainable systems still need to be put in place to guide centre operation.</p><p>Kids World Childcare Ltd have introduced their organisations overarching policies and procedures to guide practice. They have begun to personalise them to the centre. A review of these is required to ensure that they meet the requirements of the <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Services 2008</em>. Through this review, leaders should support teachers and whƒÅnau to understand the requirements of these policies and procedures. Leaders should build their understanding of the <em>Vulnerable Children‚Äôs Act (2014)</em> and incorporate these requirements through the relevant policies and appointment procedures.</p><p>Internal evaluation is in the very early stages of development. A full cycle of review is not yet completed. New managers have undertaken initial audits of resourcing and curriculum areas and are using this to inform ongoing developments. Leaders and teachers should be supported to develop an understanding of the internal evaluation process and use this to effectively judge the impact of what they do on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Some evidence has been provided to ERO about the professional development engaged in by teachers and leaders. However, there was insufficient information available to show the impact of these on changes across all aspects of the centre's development plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids World Childcare Ltd T/A Bulls C.A.L.F completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>To improve practice</h3><p>Managers and leaders should improve practices in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meeting legal requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updating Kids World Childcare policies to reflect this service and its location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building staff knowledge of expectations for health and safety and regularly monitoring the implementation of these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a comprehensive system for recording police vetting, teacher registration and first aid details.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Kids World Childcare Ltd T/A Bulls C.A.L.F. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids World Childcare Ltd T/A Bulls C.A.L.F will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>5 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
