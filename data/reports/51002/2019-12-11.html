</table><p>Aramoho Playcentre requires further development so that Playcentre Aotearoa, leaders and parents ensure compliance with all health and safety licensing requirements, as outlined in the <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008.</em></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aramoho Playcentre is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 27 children three days a week. This includes 12 children up to the age of two years. At the time of this review, there were 26 children enrolled.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, ‚ÄòwhƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together‚Äô, is to 'empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together'. Alongside this, the centre philosophy promotes positive relationships with adults and children all supporting each other to provide a high-quality service that is welcoming to all.</p><p>Since the February 2017 ERO report, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation has restructured by amalgamating all associations to form Playcentre Aotearoa. Aramoho Playcentre is part of the Lower North Island Region and is supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>WhƒÅnau and families share responsibility for the curriculum. Day-to-day operation is undertaken by session support personnel and centre-elected office holders. A centre support worker and centre administrator regularly visit playcentres to provide professional support, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas for development for the association and the playcentre. These included: internal evaluation; planning for learning; appraisal processes; transition to school; Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based implementation; and practices that support sustainability of operation. These continue to be progressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 playcentres in the Lower North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Building all members' understanding of self-review for accountability to ensure all legislative requirements are met is a key next step. Members should be supported by Playcentre Aotearoa to build knowledge and understandings of policies and procedures and support systematic monitoring of these to ensure licensing requirements are upheld.</p><p>Children are confident explorers who lead their learning experiences in well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas. Children's self-care is fostered. Educators use a range of strategies to support their learning. Infants and toddlers grow and learn through one-to-one interactions that are nurturing, positive and respectful.</p><p>A framework guides assessment, planning and evaluation well. Planning for individual children highlights their strengths, preferences and interests. An online platform is promoting more input from members. Portfolios include learning narratives of children's current learning experiences and some progress. Increasing educators' depth of knowledge and understanding of planning for learning is needed.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are visible in the centre environment with posters, maps, kupu MƒÅori and photos displayed. A next step is to include te ao MƒÅori through the planning and assessment practices.</p><p>Review for accountability and improvement is ongoing. A new review framework has been introduced and is in the initial stages of implementation. A next step is for educators to further extend their knowledge, practice and use of evaluation with the focus on positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The revised parent education programme is becoming more accessible to centre members. At this playcentre several educators have accessed professional learning to build their capability. There is a strong focus on increasing membership, encouraging adult education and supporting new members into centre roles.</p><p>Appraisal processes for session support staff have recently been strengthened to better evaluate performance in relation to specific roles and responsibilities, identify professional learning and development needs and focus on achievement of goals.</p><p>The national restructuring process continues to require significant attention and support to implement an extensive range of systems and processes. Regular communication from Playcentre Aotearoa seeks to keep parents informed of progress, changes and upcoming requirements. National policies and procedures have recently been introduced and parents are in the process of aligning practices to these. Ongoing support is required to enable parents to understand and implement these procedures to meet licensing requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure members' participation in education programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include te ao MƒÅori throughout the planning and assessment processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should continue to build knowledge and understanding of policies and procedures, and systematic monitoring of these, to ensure licensing requirements are upheld.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aramoho Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety practices and premises and facilities.</p><p>To meet and improve current compliance practice Playcentre Aotearoa should ensure the service:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>undertakes the assessment and management of risk for all excursions outside of the licensed premise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implements a process for adults to record administering of medication to children (other than their own) while at the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has documented records related to hazard checks, accidents, fire and earthquake and emergency records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises supports effective adult supervision of the children. <br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17, HS 28, HS12, HS¬†27, HS8, PF1</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite stage of the evaluation, the centre has provided:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evidence that three monthly fire and earthquake drills are carried out (HS8).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>11 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
