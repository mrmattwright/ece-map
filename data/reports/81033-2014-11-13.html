</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ranfurly Playcentre is one of 35 playcentres within the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) and is located in the rural township of Ranfurly. It provides one morning session a week for children from birth to school age.</p><p>In 2013 the centre underwent a challenging period and numbers of children attending were very low. However, there was a very strong desire for the playcentre to remain open in this community and a group of dedicated parents has worked hard to ensure that the centre remains viable. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>actively fundraising to ensure the centre is financially viable</li>
<li>refurbishing the indoor area of the playcentre so that it is inviting and welcoming</li>
<li>a number of parents undertaking playcentre training so that there are enough qualified adults to run the sessions.</li>
</ul><p>While the parents are working through their training, the playcentre has been well supported by the centre advisor and qualified people within the community. The playcentre is now moving forward in a very positive way and has adjusted the license to accommodate the increasing numbers of infants and toddlers now attending.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 reviews in the Otago Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing are well supported at Ranfurly Playcentre. The indoor and outdoor areas are spacious and well resourced. They provide many opportunities for children to develop physical skills, to explore and be creative.</p><p>On arrival children settle quickly into their play. There is a wide range of resources and activities provided for them, including planned activities that promote early literacy and mathematics and cooperation.</p><p>There is an enthusiastic and motivated group of parents attending the centre. They and the educator work well together during the sessions to support children‚Äôs learning. The adults:</p><ul>
<li>effectively support children to take turns and play alongside each other</li>
<li>follow children‚Äôs leads</li>
<li>know the children well and have fun with them.</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported in this mixed-age setting. A safe and well-designed area with appropriate resources has been created for them. There is separate and useful planning for these children.</p><p>There is a strong commitment evident to developing the MƒÅori dimension in the programme. Two parents have delegated responsibilities to support this and this is becoming evident in practice, for example, wall displays, waiata and karakia before kai.</p><p>As part of this review, ERO investigated how well the centre supports children‚Äôs early mathematical learning. ERO found that there had been some deliberate planning for mathematics in the group planning. For example, planning showed opportunities to develop mathematics concepts through baking. Some stories show mathematical learning. Some wall displays showed the mathematics learning that occurs through play. When the educator and parents plan for individual children they should document children‚Äôs progress in mathematics. There is scope to build parents‚Äô knowledge of the wider range of mathematics learning</p><p>There are effective systems for the running of the centre. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>guidelines and expectations for adults and children, for example fair-play rules</li>
<li>all information being well displayed and easy for parents to see and know about</li>
<li>carrying out effective self review and a strong focus on improvement.</li>
</ul><p>A strength of this centre has been the way that the parents have collaborated. When redeveloping the centre philosophy, the parents considered what was important for them at the playcentre and involved the children in these discussions. The philosophy is now prominently displayed and described to show what it looks like at Ranfurly Playcentre.</p><p>The playcentre has been very well supported by the centre advisor.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A key next step for the parents is to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the centre. This includes continuing:</p><ul>
<li>with the playcentre training to ensure sufficient qualifications to meet supervision requirements and to meet the goal of opening a second session</li>
<li>to share the workload and delegations to include all parents and avoid overload</li>
<li>to build on the improvement model through self review and including the wider parent group in this</li>
<li>to build bicultural practice, including seeking MƒÅori families' wishes for their children.</li>
</ul><p>The parents and educators need to make more manageable and embed the system for planning. Later, if the centre increases the number of sessions provided, consideration will have to be given to involving the parents in individual planning for their children.</p><h4>Governance</h4><p>The Otago Playcentre Association is facing challenges and uncertainty as the Playcentre Federation and the training they provide undergoes a period of restructuring. During this time the association has made it a priority to focus on the daily operations of the playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>ERO found that the association needs to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the appraisal process for all employed personnel</li>
<li>ensure that association policies provided to the centre are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>be more responsive and timely to training needs to enable playcentres to meet licensing and employment requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Each playcentre has the ongoing support of a centre advisor. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>regular visits to provide informal and formal feedback and encouragement</li>
<li>help parents know what to do to meet the licensing requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Centre advisors should find ways to make best practice common practice across the association, for example effective self review and planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ranfurly Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ranfurly Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>13 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
