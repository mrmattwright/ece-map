</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Levin Montessori is a privately owned centre located on the rural outskirts of Levin. It is one of several operating under the service provider G. Williams Daycare Limited. The centre provides education and care for up to 30 children from two to six years of age. Of the 45 children, eight are MƒÅori. Two visiting teachers are employed to provide regular support and guidance to the teaching team.</p><p>The philosophy reflect values of respect for each other and the environment and a strong sense of whanaungatanga. Teachers plan to review the philosophy as part of their planned internal evaluation processes.</p><p>The November 2013 ERO report for the centre, identified that managers and teachers should further develop self-review processes including strengthening appraisal. Positive progress has occurred.</p><p>All teachers hold early childhood and Montessori qualifications, and are fully registered.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre programme successfully reflects the Montessori approach and an appropriate knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Teachers plan for groups and individuals. They notice, recognise and respond to groups and at times individual children‚Äôs emerging interests, ideas and passions. Prominent wall displays and accessible profile books make children‚Äôs learning visible to them and their parents. Links are often made to children‚Äôs prior learning, and progress over time is increasingly evident.</p><p>Opportunities for parents to contribute to their child's learning occur regularly. Formal parent meetings with teachers include sharing aspirations, children‚Äôs strengths and interests and next learning steps. Learners develop independently and are seen as competent, able to initiate interactions and lead themselves. Thoughtfully selected resources and positive peer interactions stimulate learning.¬†</p><p>Children are involved in activities for sustained periods. Positive, calm and sensitive relationships support their wellbeing and willingness to learn. Younger children have space and time to lead their learning. Building and showing respect are woven into interactions.</p><p>Children are presented with a wide variety of literacy experiences that enables them to regularly observe, listen and play with language. Teachers generally use meaningful contexts to develop print awareness and alphabet knowledge. Mathematical understanding is built through frequent opportunities for children to use numbers, shapes and patterns in everyday activities. Literacy and mathematical learning is supported by high quality resources.</p><p>Biculturalism is successfully promoted by the valuing of te a≈ç MƒÅori. MƒÅori concepts, language, customs and beliefs are integrated into the programme. Teachers effectively provide for MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Inclusive practices ensure children requiring additional learning support participate fully in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers. Diversity is valued. Teachers seek ways to maintain children‚Äôs connections to their various cultural identities, including using parent knowledge and skills.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is managed with care as they transition into the centre. Teachers support parents to settle their child according to needs. Staff participation in cluster meetings with local schools and centres supports establishing and building closer links with a range of schools. This involvement should help children moving on to school.</p><p>Staff work collaboratively to support positive outcomes for children. The visiting teacher provides effective professional leadership. She offers useful feedback and feedforward through comprehensive reports and is available to teachers for support as required. The visiting teacher works with the head teacher and teaching team to ensure day-to-day operation effectively promotes the education, care, health and safety of children.</p><p>Appropriate professional learning contributes to better understanding of responding to diverse groups of learners, and effective internal evaluation. The teacher appraisal process is developmental and encourages evidence-based reflection on each of the criteria for effective teaching. Strategic planning is closely linked to the centre vision and philosophy and includes a curriculum focus. It provides direction for the service and supports ongoing improvement and sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers should continue to consider how responsive their deliberate teaching practices are to support individual children‚Äôs emerging interests and learning.</p><p>Improved systems support internal evaluation. Continuing to implement the process should enhance outcomes for children through a stronger focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the quality of the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identification of priorities for improvement based on best practice indicators.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Levin Montessori completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Levin Montessori will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>3 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
