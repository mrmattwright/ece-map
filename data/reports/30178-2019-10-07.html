</table><p>Amazing Place Preschool (Sunset Road) requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The service needs support to further develop their curriculum, teaching and learning. There is also a need to improve systems and processes to ensure effective governance, self-review and day-to-day management of the service.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amazing Place Preschool (Sunset Road) provides full day education and care for children from six months to school age. It is located in central Rotorua. The centre operates two aged-based areas with shared outdoor spaces. It is licensed for 48 children including 12 children up to the age of two years. The current roll of 40 children includes 16 children who identify as Māori and 24 children from a wide range of other nationalities including children of Pacific heritage. The teaching team are made up of qualified and unqualified staff.</p><p>Through their vision and philosophy, teachers aim to develop caring relationships with all children and their families helping them learn, thrive and to grow holistically.</p><p>Amazing Place Preschool (Sunset Road) is one of five early learning centres governed by the Bethlehem Early Learning Centres Board. The board provide an overarching governance and management framework that guides the strategic direction. The head teacher is supported by a company manager and teachers.</p><p>Teachers have responded to areas identified for development in the July 2016 ERO report. Progress has included a review of assessment, planning and evaluation with a focus on children's individual interests. Teachers have taken steps to include parent involvement in ongoing internal review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Staff prioritise and value relationships and the provision of an inclusive environment where children and their families are welcomed. Teachers know children and their family connections well. Positive relationships promote children's sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers provide children with resources and activities for play. Whānau are encouraged to contribute their knowledge and skills to the programme. Children benefit from learning about their local and wider community with excursions and trips into the community.</p><p>Assessment and planning processes are being refined and require strengthening. A process based on individual children's interests has been re-introduced. Intentional teaching and strategies that support the progress of children's identified learning outcomes over time are not yet in place. Teachers have identified the need to integrate bicultural assessment approaches to support and respond to Maori learners and the cultures, language and identities of other learners.</p><p>Teachers are needing support to implement a curriculum based on current theories and practise. Leaders need to ensure infants and toddlers are encouraged to participate during daily routines and have suitable access to resources and spaces that invite their participation and learning.</p><p>Management should improve systems and processes that inform the centre's current and future direction and practices. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>the alignment of annual goals to longer term strategic plans and priorities. Clarifying annual goals that are more explicit about the education outcomes expected for children and the preschool should further assist the service to determine which actions are making the most difference for learners</li>
<li>a process is in place to guide internal evaluation. Further development is required to strengthen evaluation leadership and teachers understanding of effective internal evaluation for improvement. Consideration should also be given to purposeful ways to encourage, invite and respond to whānau contributions</li>
<li>the appraisal process enables management to identify priorities for improving and growing teaching practices. The implementation of this process requires more rigour, including observations relating to and of teaching practice and regular documented feedback to build teacher capability. Managers should urgently review and develop policy guidelines related to appraisal to better support teacher development.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for governance, management and the teaching team's development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment and planning practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability to effectively use internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing whānau with meaningful opportunities to be involved in decision making about their child's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The appraisal policy has since been updated to reflect the Teaching Council standards and associated criteria after the time of the review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amazing Place Preschool (Sunset Road) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>effective governance and management<br><em>[Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 47 (1a)]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>7 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
