</table><p><span>Active Explorers St Lukes i</span>s well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers St Lukes (previously operating as Lollipops St Lukes) is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 100 children, including up to 40 aged under two years. Children are grouped according to age into four separate learning spaces. Children and their families come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, and many speak more than one language.</p><p>A centre manager and two head teachers lead a team of five qualified and five unqualified teachers. While the centre attempts to recruit more teachers, a small group of long-term relievers completes the team. The centre is owned by Evolve Education Group (EEG). Visiting personnel from EEG support the centre manager with day-to-day operations and long-term planning and development projects.</p><p>The recently reviewed centre philosophy is focused on creating an environment that fosters individual learning and success, through positive, respectful relationships with whƒÅnau. The key dispositions of confidence, curiosity, independence, creativity, perseverance, empathy and resilience are held in high regard. The Treaty of Waitangi is recognised as a guiding document.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report acknowledged the respectful relationships with children and families and the calm, unhurried environment for infants and toddlers. Areas for development in the 2016 report included strengthening self review, bicultural understandings and practices, and building teachers professional knowledge, capability and teamwork. There has been good progress in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled. They make choices about their play. Teachers are responsive and engage them in positive, supportive interactions. Older children involve themselves well in a wide range of experiences and imaginative play with a good variety of resources that enable them to sustain their engagement. Effective questioning from teachers promotes more complex thinking.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive gentle care from teachers who are aware of their individual needs. Consideration could be given to the learning resources in the infants and toddlers spaces and how effectively children engage with them. Indoor environments centre-wide are attractive and inviting. Outdoor environments are more challenging, and plans are in place to make these more open and accessible to children and to ease supervision for teachers.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are woven throughout centre practices. Te ao MƒÅori is evident in programme planning to varying levels, but is particularly strong for the older children. This is being led well across the centre by the recently appointed centre manager.</p><p>Leaders and teachers reflect the cultures of the children. They use children's home languages in day-to-day interactions and include songs, music and cultural celebrations in the programme in authentic ways. Leaders and teachers are using the Ministry of Education's TƒÅpasƒÅ framework to strengthen teachers' knowledge and understanding of Pacific learners.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau contribute very well to the programme, the environment and support centre events. Teachers actively and successfully seek whƒÅnau feedback and this is included in the development of centre practices and documentation.</p><p>Teachers successfully implement effective strategies to support children's developing social competence. They place emphasis on enabling, through communication, children's understanding of each other and what is happening around them. Teachers skilfully include science, mathematics and literacy in the programme in meaningful ways.</p><p>Teachers plan and evaluate meaningful programmes for individuals and groups of children based on their observations of children at play. Assessment practices enhance children's identity as successful learners. WhƒÅnau voice is included in planning for children's learning.</p><p>EEG leaders have established an effective process for centres to implement internal evaluation. They have provided effective professional development that has enhanced this centre's leaders' understanding of the process, and this is driving improvement. Leaders have collaboratively established strategic and annual plans to guide the centre's direction.</p><p>EEG provides a framework of policies and procedures to guide centre practices. This framework continues to be reviewed. An effective process for staff appraisal is in place. EEG need to ensure managers are implementing this process effectively.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing professional learning and development for teachers in the infant and toddler rooms specific to quality care for children under two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to promote teachers' understanding and use of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to enhance programme planning and evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group Senior Managers have agreed that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company's vision and values, goals and principles reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addressing staffing issues in some centres to ensure quality teaching practices are evident, promoting positive outcomes for all children and ensuring sustainability of quality practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively the levels and quality of learning resources in centres promote collaboration amongst children and promote more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional learning and development for leaders and teachers to ensure a deeper engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers St Lukes completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, Evolve Education Group Senior Managers must take steps to ensure that health and safety policies and procedures are implemented rigorously across all services.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
