</table><p>ABC Waterview¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Waterview provides for up to 40 children in an adapted residential property. Programmes provided for older children are in the Oaktree room, and for up to 14 infants and toddlers in the Acorn room. The centre caters for the neighbouring community.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart charitable trust. It provides an overarching governance and management framework to support operations and curriculum delivery in individual centres. Business managers (BM) and professional services managers (PSM) lead the staff professional development and provide strategic guidance.</p><p>The majority of the staff are new to the centre. A centre manager, an assistant manager and a head teacher have been employed recently. BestStart has appointed a new PSM and BM to support centre management and teachers' professional practice. The new team has worked to re-establish management and curriculum practices.</p><p>Managers have addressed the areas for development identified in ERO's 2015 report. The centre's philosophy has been reviewed and emphasises children's learning through play.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in BestStart's Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children socialise well with their peers in a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Friendships are fostered, and children support each other through tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Staff provide gentle and nurturing care and encourage infants and toddlers to explore their surroundings. Stimulating resources and activities help children to gain confidence in exploring the environment and interacting with others.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are focusing on building whanaungatanga in the centre and have taken deliberate steps to welcome whƒÅnau and the neighbouring community. Teachers know children well and are now building constructive learning relationships with children and parents.</p><p>With the help of parents and community, leaders and teachers have recently put considerable work into improving the learning environment for children. The strategic purchase of new resources is adding to children's choices and engagement in play.</p><p>Staff and families have diverse cultural backgrounds and languages. Leaders and teachers are extending their knowledge and skills to better support this rich diversity of cultures and languages. Teachers are studying te reo MƒÅori to gain confidence in bicultural practices. Their planned work to unpack <em>TapasƒÅ,</em> the Ministry of Education's cultural competencies framework, will help them to better respond to Pacific cultures.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes for groups of children. They include experiences that support children's developing oral language. A next step is to develop individual planning processes that focus on each child's learning dispositions and interests and can be used by teachers to extend children's learning.</p><p>Individual learning records are available online for parents to view their children's learning records and to communicate with the centre. Parents are encouraged to participate as learning partners with their children and the teachers.</p><p>Leaders are establishing a culture in the centre that supports ongoing improvement. They are beginning to build teachers' professional practice to support improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans, and a shared vision. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promote a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and support more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Leaders and teachers regularly revisit the centre's strategic goals and annual action plans to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish individual planning processes to focus on each child's learning dispositions and interests, and extend learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' capability through inquiry into the quality and effectiveness of teaching practices, and developing shared understandings of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in shared professional development to develop leaders' and teachers' professional capacity and to support coaching and mentoring.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review ERO has requested, and BestStart managers have provided, an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates against the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Waterview completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>27 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
