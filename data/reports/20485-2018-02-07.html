</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tots Corner in Northcote is a well-established centre that provides education and care for children from six months to five years of age. The centre operates in a converted villa that has three separate spaces for children of different ages. The 'Nest' caters for infants from 6 months to approximately two years of age, the 'Kiwi' room is for children from two to three and a half years of age, and the 'Tui' room is for children up to school age. The majority of children attend full-time.</p><p>Teachers incorporate practices from Reggio Emilia, an early childhood teaching model that respects children as capable and competent learners and decision-makers. This complements the practices outlined in <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre has a positive history of ERO reporting. Effective leadership, connectedness with families, and high quality care for children are the characteristics that continue to define the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families arrive each day to a calm, settled centre and warmly welcoming staff. Teachers and parents have a strong partnership bond. There is a gentle pace to the day and teachers provide children with respectful and mindful care. All of this contributes to children having a sense of belonging and trust that allows them to relax, enjoy friendships, play and achieve deep learning. Transitions into and through the centre are calm, responsive to children's needs, and developed in partnership with parents.</p><p>A strong, shared vision guides practices. The centre programme is child-focused and child-led. Teachers are actively involved in children's learning and provide support when necessary. The emphasis is on enabling children to make decisions and manage their own learning as capable and competent learners. Children's thinking is challenged through conversations with teachers, and their interests are recognised, nurtured and extended. The centre's vision and philosophy are strongly evident in teachers' practices.</p><p>Learning through play is highly valued by teachers. Creativity, in all its forms, is supported using prompts in the environment. These prompts provide opportunities for children to explore, experiment, design, make and record their thinking. Teachers extend these opportunities through their conversations with children. This is helping to build children's persistence, research and experimentation, leading to learning that affirms their sense of themselves as successful leaders and learners.</p><p>Programme planning is flexible and responsive. As well as the daily programme, teachers plan excursions and experiences beyond the centre to broaden and enhance children's knowledge and learning. The once-weekly visits the older children make to a local ngahere (forest) are strengthening children's understanding and enjoyment of the natural world and developing their nature-based creativity. Children share their ngahere experiences with enthusiasm.</p><p>Children's portfolios are meaningful records of their individual learning journeys. They also outline for parents the learning arising out of children's group experiences. The centre uses an online portal to keep parents informed about their child's learning. Many parents respond through the portal by sharing information from home to add to teachers' knowledge about children. Teachers aim to continue to deepen partnerships and connections with families and to invite further input.</p><p>Teachers are actively improving their use of te reo Māori with children, following attendance at professional language courses. They sing waiata, use words and phrases in conversations with children, and say a karakia before kai. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident in play, through good support by older children for their younger peers. Including reference to Te Tiriti o Waitangi in the philosophy would affirm the centre's moves to embrace the principles inherent in the document.</p><p>Management of the centre is efficient, well-developed and highly supportive of staff. The owner/manager and senior staff inspire teachers to continually evaluate the quality of their practice. They also provide, and support staff to attend relevant and useful professional development. Leadership is shared across the centre utilising the different skills and knowledge that teachers are able to provide.</p><p>The owner/manager is involved, at a management level, in a number of early childhood professional forums. She brings enthusiasm and passion to her work for children. Her leadership is a key driver in ensuring the effectiveness of the centre. She is a founding member, and is on the Stewardship Committee of the Kāhui Ako (Community of Learners) group with local schools. Through this role she advocates strongly to support understanding of the value to children, of early childhood learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and teachers should continue to sustain the excellent quality of programmes for children by maintaining the high standards they have set in teaching and learning practices. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tots Corner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tots Corner will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>7 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
