</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz World Rutland Street originally operated as two licensed centres on the same site. The centres were amalgamated in September 2010, and the current licence is for a total of 70 children, with a maximum of 16 children under two years of age. Currently, the centre caters for 72 children, of whom 31 are identified as MƒÅori. There are also 7 children who are identified as Pacific.</p><p>The Kidz World management team consists of the centre owner/director, who works closely with the centre manager and the managers of two other centres under the same ownership. The centre owner/director has established trusting and responsive relationships, and clear roles and responsibilities. She leads the strategic planning process in consultation with staff, parents and whƒÅnau. She promotes professional inquiry and discussion and has improved communication within and between the Kidz World centres.</p><p>Rutland Street is led by a centre manager and four supervisors who lead the four age-group areas. These are staffed with a favourable ratio of teachers to children. The proportion of qualified staff meets requirements. As required, all unqualified staff are police vetted by the centre.</p><p>The last ERO review was a supplementary review undertaken in November 2011. At that time, the centre had made substantial progress since the 2010 ERO review, and has continued to make good use of self review to improve outcomes for children and their families. Additional priorities have been a review and further development of the teacher appraisal process, and the introduction of a more effective approach to professional learning and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly, have a strong sense of belonging, and are happy to approach adults to share their learning. They are independent learners with effective social and self-management skills. Children are able to select their activities and make choices. They benefit from responsive and flexible routines and relationships that support their concentration and engagement. Transitions into the centre, between areas, and to school are managed sensitively and effectively. Teachers advocate for children, and involve whƒÅnau and outside agencies as appropriate.</p><p>Babies and toddlers receive high-quality education and care within a well-prepared environment. Teachers nurture their wellbeing and development, and foster and respond to their oral and non-verbal communication. Children and teachers engaged in enjoyable activities both indoors and in the outdoor playground. They have opportunities to participate in physical challenges, sensory exploration, games and musical activities. Opportunities for children to play outdoors have been improved, and revisiting and reviewing the changes could suggest further development.</p><p>Teachers listen respectfully to children‚Äôs ideas and contributions, and build on their knowledge and thinking. Children and their families are encouraged to contribute their knowledge and ideas to the centre programme. Learning is made visible to children and their families through displays in the centre, in their portfolios, and on line. The centre manager is continuing to refine the online learning stories, which provide valuable communication with parents about their children‚Äôs learning and development. Teachers are now able to add links that identify aspects of children‚Äôs learning, and this will assist them to more consistently recognise and evaluate the continuity of children‚Äôs development and learning.</p><p>Teachers support each other within a collegial and collaborative professional culture. They are using meaningful self review, based on action research, to develop the curriculum and environment. Children‚Äôs diverse cultures are responded to respectfully. A research initiative is being undertaken to increase the centre‚Äôs bicultural understandings and knowledge.</p><p>Significant features of the curriculum are:</p><ul>
<li>the integration of literacy, numeracy and aspects of science</li>
<li>the natural inclusion of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in everyday conversations</li>
<li>the frequent use of waiata and karakia</li>
<li>the attractive presentation of the environment to invite children‚Äôs interest and play</li>
<li>opportunities for children to use computer technology to research information.</li>
</ul><p>Children‚Äôs ideas for further learning are shared and built on by teachers and other children in ongoing projects. Teachers understand the learning that is occurring, and encourage children to experiment, explore and develop their ideas about how the world works. Children have additional opportunities to learn through visits to the local and wider community.</p><p>Leadership is shared and supported by the Kidz World management team. Centre leaders have a culture of commitment to working together and sharing their understandings so they can continually improve outcomes for children. The centre manager is knowledgeable about teaching and learning, sets high expectations, and understands how to lead adults. She knows families and their children very well, and has an excellent knowledge of effective responses to children with diverse needs.</p><p>Leaders plan for relevant professional learning and development. They recognise teachers‚Äô strengths, support their development, encourage innovation, and empower them to research current best practice. The research findings are presented to the teaching teams and influence centre practice.</p><p>There is a centre-wide culture of robust self review and critical reflection resulting in ongoing improvement. The philosophy is based on the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and Te Tiriti o Waitangi and is currently being reviewed to better reflect centre values and beliefs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees that it is important to:</p><ul>
<li>complete a new three-year strategic plan to provide ongoing direction for centre development. This includes the review of the philosophy to strengthen the inclusion of service values and beliefs</li>
<li>review recent changes and developments to consider the outcomes for children and further opportunities for improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz World Rutland Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz World Rutland Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>27 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
