<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Hillsborough Playcentre is located in a quiet residential area of west Auckland adjacent to a park. The parent co-operative operates under the organisational umbrella of the Auckland Playcentre Association. The Association provides assistance with administration and training programmes for the centre.</p><p>Children of different ages interact well with one another and are happy, settled and engaged. Babies and toddlers move freely between play spaces. Caring and gentle dispositions are evident amongst children at the centre. Children are inclusive of each other in their play.</p><p>The inclusive wh&#257;nau culture of the centre is one of its key strengths. Adults know children well and participate alongside them in their activities. Trusting relationships with families are evident. Interactions and learning are enhanced by the rich mix of cultures and generations. The warm and supportive setting helps to empower Playcentre members to contribute to centre operations.</p><p>The centre environment is well resourced. Adults make good use of the variety of resources available in the spacious indoor setting. An extensive outdoor play area with established trees and lawn encourages children&rsquo;s exploration. It also has the potential to challenge children&rsquo;s physical and creative abilities. Centre members recognise that further planning and review is required to realise the potential of and fully utilise this outdoor space.</p><p>Centre members support, discuss and plan activities to enhance children&rsquo;s play. There is a commitment to increasing the training levels of adults at the centre. Members understand the importance of extending their knowledge of children&rsquo;s developmental needs and interests.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, members of Hillsborough Playcentre were invited to consider priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atHillsborough Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the 2009 ERO report the centre has further developed its strategic and annual plans. These documents support a collective understanding of centre operations. They provide a framework for making ongoing improvements to the education provided for children.</p><p>Centre members continue to embrace the Playcentre philosophy. Members engage and support each other to undertake Playcentre education. They are proactive in investigating relevant educational theories.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Learning environment.</em> Centre members provide an interesting and thoughtfully presented learning environment. The spacious indoor area allows children to engage in creative and imaginative play. A variety of resources are available. Well positioned indoor play areas enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for exploration and sustained play.</p><p><em>Settled children.</em> Children are happy and enjoy conversations with adults. They are supportive of their peers and play cooperatively in groups. Children talk to each other as they play and interact in positive ways. Trusting relationships are evident among children.</p><p><em>Strategic and annual plans.</em> Members have developed an extensive strategic plan and a detailed annual plan to support this document. They share responsibility for developing, implementing and reviewing strategic planning.</p><p><em>Self review.</em> The centre has well established systems for monitoring continuous improvement through formal, planned and cyclic self review. The Association provides good support and guidance in self review. Centre members are considering ways to incorporate and record informal and spontaneous review findings and processes.</p><p><em>Parent education.</em> Centre members have a respectful working relationship with the Auckland Playcentre Association. The Association provides guidance and support with ongoing development for parents and programmes. Members have incorporated educational theories and practices into the programme. They value the Association&rsquo;s assistance and utilise it in sessions. Centre members have established an expectation of training levels for all members. A commitment to the Playcentre philosophy and ongoing adult education contributes to the centre&rsquo;s sustainability.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>During the review, ERO and centre members discussed next steps for the Playcentre. Key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>reflecting the diverse cultures and languages of families in the centre</li>
<li>continuing to build a more bicultural learning programme for children and promoting a shared understanding and use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>achieving a balance between programmes based on children&rsquo;s interests and knowledge, and adult-initiated activities</li>
<li>developing strategies to increase the complexity of children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>continuing to review outdoor play spaces to maximise learning opportunities</li>
<li>continuing to refine and review annual plans to ensure that they are realistic and manageable.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Hillsborough Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquakes.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice centre members should develop systems to monitor the ongoing maintenance of the outdoor area.</p><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre members agree that the centre should continue to strengthen child-initiated play and increase the complexity of play.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>5 Future Action</span></h2><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

The Association provides assistance with administration and training programmes for the centre.</p><p>Children of different ages interact well with one another and are happy, settled and engaged. Babies and toddlers move freely between play spaces. Caring and gentle dispositions are evident amongst children at the centre. Children are inclusive of each other in their play.</p><p>The inclusive wh&#257;nau culture of the centre is one of its key strengths. Adults know children well and participate alongside them in their activities. Trusting relationships with families are evident. Interactions and learning are enhanced by the rich mix of cultures and generations. The warm and supportive setting helps to empower Playcentre members to contribute to centre operations.</p><p>The centre environment is well resourced. Adults make good use of the variety of resources available in the spacious indoor setting. An extensive outdoor play area with established trees and lawn encourages children&rsquo;s exploration. It also has the potential to challenge children&rsquo;s physical and creative abilities. Centre members recognise that further planning and review is required to realise the potential of and fully utilise this outdoor space.</p><p>Centre members support, discuss and plan activities to enhance children&rsquo;s play. There is a commitment to increasing the training levels of adults at the centre. Members understand the importance of extending their knowledge of children&rsquo;s developmental needs and interests.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
