</table><p>Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre is very well placed to promote learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre is one of two centres managed and supported by Lincoln Hospitality Ltd, a subsidiary of Lincoln University. This small, semi-rural centre provides education and care for the children of students and staff of the university as well as children from the local community.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 33 children aged from birth to school age. Families from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds attend the centre.</p><p>The experienced centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre. Most staff are qualified and certified early childhood teachers. Some have been at the centre for a long time.</p><p>The centre has a focus on sustainable practices. It has achieved the bronze level of the Enviroschool programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made good progress addressing the key next steps from the 2013 ERO report. They have strengthened assessment processes and embedded their internal evaluation practices. A thorough appraisal system is in place. They have yet to fully implement their ideas to extend the role of children in assessing their own learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and well engaged in their learning. They experience respectful, responsive relationships with each other and their teachers. There are many opportunities for them to work with peers cooperatively or alone in interesting play spaces.</p><p>Children choose from a wide range of inviting resources, including materials that foster their creative thinking skills. They are supported to investigate deeply any areas of interest. Children are encouraged to explore and play in the natural environment. They enjoy an extensive range of physically challenging equipment.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and inclusive. They place strong emphasis on being effective, intentional teachers who focus thoughtfully on children's learning by providing a rich learning environment. Teachers purposefully plan creative and meaningful learning experiences to foster children's growing independence and confidence.</p><p>Teachers work as a collaborative, supportive team. They regularly share information about children's learning and development. Teachers highly value and celebrate children's home cultures. Their commitment to bicultural practice is clearly visible in the centre environment. Children benefit from the close relationships teachers build with families to ensure they know each child well.</p><p>The small group of infants and toddlers experience calm, unhurried and nurturing interactions with their teachers. They have easy access to a wide range of sensory experiences and carefully- presented resources. Teachers use relevant New Zealand sign language with these children to support the ongoing development of their communication skills. Toddlers have many opportunities to play with older children as part of the learning programme.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are flexible and focused on the needs of children and their families. Leaders and teachers have close working relationships with local schools. They regularly arrange visits to two of these schools to support children's successful transitions to school.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about their child's learning, development and participation at the centre. They are encouraged to be regularly involved in the centre and their contributions are highly valued. Teachers create effective learning partnerships with parents to ensure they are part of setting their children's learning priorities.</p><p>Teachers have many opportunities to develop and share their leadership skills. They work in a culture of critical reflection. Teachers place a strong emphasis on improving learning outcomes for children and extending their own knowledge and skills.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are deeply improvement focused. The centre manager ensures there is consistent alignment of university processes, the centre's strategic and annual plans, staff appraisal processes, targeted professional development and internal evaluation. A comprehensive range of policies and practices guides the smooth operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to promote positive learning outcomes for all children include:</p><ul>
<li>extending the role of children in leading and evaluating their own learning</li>
<li>further embedding bicultural concepts in practice and key centre documentation</li>
<li>further strengthening the focus on learning and teaching in group planning and evaluation. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>29 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
