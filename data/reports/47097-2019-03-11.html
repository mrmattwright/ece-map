</table><p>Kea Kids Childcare Robertson Road¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the first ERO evaluation of Kea Kids Centre Robertson Road, which opened in October 2016, and is one of five centres owned and operated by Ferns Education Limited. The centre is licensed for 55 children, including 15 children aged up to 2 years. It provides full-day care and learning programmes in a purpose-built facility. Three separate rooms cater for different age related groups of children. The roll includes predominately MƒÅori, Pacific and Indian children, with smaller numbers from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on creating a quality 'home away from home' environment. WhƒÅnau and community involvement in the curriculum and children's learning is encouraged. MƒÅori and Pacific perspectives and languages are promoted with a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Meeting the needs of a diverse and multicultural community is also a focus.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are welcomed into the well-resourced centre. Children play in spacious indoor and outdoor learning areas. They enjoy good access to a wide range of equipment and have many opportunities to make choices about their play. Children are settled and comfortable in the centre environment and play well alongside each other.</p><p>Children engage well with their teachers. They are familiar with centre routines that allow them time to sustain their interest in activities, and have opportunities for mixed age group play. Children and whƒÅnau benefit from teachers who speak languages other than English. This contributes to both children's and families' sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a very strong commitment to enacting the centre's philosophy and kaupapa. Relationships sit at the heart of all operations. Staff are exploring aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophy which aligns well with the centre's philosophy, vision and values. Teachers develop trusting relationships with children and foster their emotional wellbeing. Children with additional learning needs are well supported in the centre's inclusive environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well catered for in age appropriate indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers are sensitive, attentive and responsive to the needs and preferences of these young children. Respectful nurturing care and unhurried child centred routines are evident.</p><p>Bicultural practices are a strong feature of the centre. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are woven through learning programmes. Children's languages and cultures are recognised and celebrated. Children benefit from hearing multiple languages during the day.</p><p>WhƒÅnau aspirations and involvement in the centre are valued. Leaders and teachers are considering ways to further develop learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. They are currently establishing a parent/whƒÅnau hub that could strengthen whƒÅnau involvement in their children's learning.</p><p>Transitions into, through, and on to school are well managed and based on children's individual needs. Children and their whƒÅnau benefit from unhurried transitions between rooms. The centre is beginning to implement the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> early childhood curriculum. Planned professional development will assist teachers to develop pathways and relationships with schools, in line with <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em></p><p>In 2018 the centre experienced leadership and staffing challenges. Kea Kids' governance and leadership personnel supported the centre well. In August 2018 a new centre manager was appointed. The teaching team is now working collaboratively, professionally and responding well to change.</p><p>Good internal and external support structures are in place to increase leadership and teaching capacity. The area manager ensures that the centre manager and teachers have access to relevant professional development to foster a culture of ongoing improvement. Teaching teams across the Kea Kids centres work collaboratively, and share professional dialogue to grow their understanding about effective teaching practice. Planned professional learning is focused on strengthening planning, assessment and more in-depth evaluation of the impact of teaching practice on children's learning.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. The strategic direction of the centre is well documented, and a good policy framework is followed and regularly reviewed. New procedures for performance management and teacher appraisal are being introduced. Teachers will need ongoing support as these new systems are embedded in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>broadening teacher understanding of the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen teachers' programme planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening evaluation, and documenting the impact of teaching programmes on children's outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing relevant support to embed the new teacher appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kea Kids Childcare Robertson Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>11 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
