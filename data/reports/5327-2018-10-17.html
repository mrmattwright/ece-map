</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dyer Street Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 50 children, aged over two years. Sessions run daily from 8:30am to 2:30 pm. Of the 60 children currently enrolled, five are MƒÅori. The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises social competence, belonging, communication and partnership with families. Teaching staff are fully qualified. A new head teacher was appointed in 2016.</p><p>At the time of this review, the kindergarten was undergoing redevelopment of the outdoor area to offer more opportunities for children to interact with nature.</p><p>Dyer Street Kindergarten is one of 19 in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the September 2015 ERO report, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key next steps for this kindergarten that included developing planning, assessment and internal evaluation practices. Progress is evident. Teachers acknowledge that cultural responsiveness, particularly to MƒÅori and Pacific learners, remains an area for further development.</p><p>Practices requiring development were also identified for the association. These included: strategic planning; cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families; evaluation; and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of nine in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the busy, joyful learning environment. They are challenged to try new experiences, take risks and explore nature. Teachers learn and play alongside children, responding to their interests and extending their ideas through rich conversations. Building children‚Äôs social competence and friendship skills is a clear focus for teachers, and a strength of the kindergarten.</p><p>The learning environment is spacious and thoughtfully resourced. Teachers are exploring how to make the diverse cultures of the community more visible in the kindergarten. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>Teachers successfully support children to be inclusive of others. New children and their families are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. Teachers purposefully build strong, trusting relationships with parents and whƒÅnau, supporting their sense of belonging. A range of effective, reciprocal parent partnership practices promote each family's confident contribution to their child‚Äôs learning journey.</p><p>Aspects of tikanga MƒÅori are evident in the curriculum. Teachers seek to improve their use of te reo MƒÅori as well as their knowledge of more meaningful, localised bicultural practices. This is likely to be supported by the association‚Äôs current strategic focus in this area. Association leaders should also continue to build teachers‚Äô understanding of specific strategies, in partnership with whƒÅnau, that promote the learning success of MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are well supported. External agencies are accessed, as appropriate, in consultation with parents.</p><p>A good relationship has been established with the adjacent school. Reciprocal visits occur regularly. A range of useful strategies support children's and parents‚Äô confidence when transitioning to school.</p><p>Learning portfolios are used well to record children‚Äôs interests, discoveries, growing friendships and progress. Teachers value parents' perspectives and aspirations for their children's learning. A new system for assessment, planning and evaluation has recently been introduced, that involves gathering a range of useful information about children's cultural and home contexts. Teachers should now focus on ensuring that they consistently make use of this information in planning for learning.</p><p>The teaching team are reflective and improvement focused. Kindergarten teachers are supported to grow their internal evaluation practice through very useful association systems and tools. Senior teachers should continue to work with teachers to build their capacity to measure the impact of their practice on children‚Äôs learning outcomes.</p><p>The head teacher promotes professional trust, discussion and debate. There are opportunities for teachers to take on leadership roles, according to their strengths and interests. They are engaged practitioners who successfully promote a strong sense of community for children and families.¬†</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goal-setting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen teacher development by implementing an inquiry-based approach to appraisal. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction. This should support teachers to better measure the success of improved practices in promoting outcomes for specific children and priority groups.</p><p>The association's senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning. Leaders are successfully fostering a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.</p><p>The governance board includes community representatives with a wide range of useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work well together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. Equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing are actively sought.</p><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that they should continue to build their effectiveness by:</p><ul>
<li>measuring the extent to which children's and their families‚Äô outcomes are improved though association initiatives and systems. This should include analysing their impact on specific priority groups</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for whƒÅnau to actively contribute to the association‚Äôs operation and strategic direction.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>improve the bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>continue to build culturally responsive practice</li>
<li>embed the new assessment, planning and evaluation system.</li>
</ul><p>The association agrees they should increase focus on:¬†¬†¬†</p><ul>
<li>measuring outcomes for children and their families</li>
<li>developing whƒÅnau and community partnership practices.¬†</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dyer Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dyer Street Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</p><p>17 October 2018¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
