<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation-home-based-care-bizzy-buddyz-waikato" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation&nbsp; Home-Based Care Bizzy Buddyz Waikato</h2><p>Bizzy Buddyz Ltd provides education and care for children from birth to school age, in educarers&rsquo; homes. The service is privately owned and operates four networks, three in Whakatane covering the Eastern Bay of Plenty, and one in the Waikato. This network is based in Hamilton and is overseen by a knowledgeable manager. Experienced and qualified visiting teachers are responsible for managing the quality of education and care in educarers&rsquo; homes. The service&rsquo;s programmes are guided by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The owner/director and visiting teachers continue to provide sound governance and management for the service. A notable strength of the service is the positive and trusting relationships among children, educarers, families and visiting teachers. Educarers enjoy working with children and are committed to supporting their wellbeing and development.</p><p>Frequent outings in the community and regular attendance at playgroups provide new experiences and opportunities for children and educarers to socialise. Learning programmes effectively promote children&rsquo;s language development, mathematical knowledge and social competencies. Children are becoming confident, capable learners in a variety of inclusive home environments that provide rich and meaningful contexts for learning.</p><p>The visiting teachers provide educarers with useful advice and guidance, and suggest ways to give children relevant additional activities and experiences. Discussions are focused on reviewing the progress and development of each child.</p><p>ERO and the service owner/director agree there is a need to strengthen professional leadership in implementing effective staff-appraisal and self-review processes. During home visits ERO identified some health and safety matters that need to be addressed.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Bizzy Buddyz Waikato aims to provide quality childcare and education with positive outcomes for children. Since the last ERO review the service has moved to new premises and there have been some changes in the teaching team. A 3-4 year old play group has been introduced to support children&rsquo;s transition to school. During this review, ERO visited four educarers&rsquo; homes and attended a mixed-age play group session.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Management and governance: The owner/director provides sound management and governance for the service. Educarers are well informed about the service&rsquo;s expectations for education and care. There are clear guidelines that outline expectations for practice, and meeting legislative requirements. Visiting teachers organise playgroups and outings that provide opportunities for children and educarers to socialise and learn. They provide advice and additional resources including access to the service's toy library. The service provides educarers and visiting teachers with generous professional development to keep them up to date with current theory and practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Visiting teachers: The visiting teachers effectively support educarers in their roles and responsibilities through regular visits to the home. They model positive learning interactions with children and their discussions with educarers are focused on successful outcomes for children. Visiting teachers provide educarers with support through additional resources and regular visits. The progress and development of each child forms the focus for discussion, reflection and planning.</p><p>Relationships: Relationships throughout the service are nurturing and positive. There is mutual trust and respect among visiting teachers, educarers and children. Notable strengths of relationships within the service are:</p><ul>
<li>interactions between educarers and children that foster children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and wellbeing, as well as individualised care routines for babies</li>
<li>small size of groups and high adult-to-child ratios</li>
<li>opportunities for children to explore and pursue their interest in calm, settled home environments</li>
<li>open and responsive communication between educarers and visiting teachers</li>
<li>ongoing communication and sharing of information about children's leaning and development with parents/wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><p>Relationships at all levels support children to develop their social skills and confidence as capable learners.</p><p>Programme: Children experience an inclusive programme where they learn in family home environments and through frequent outings in the local community. They also benefit from participating in regular playgroups and opportunities to interact with other educarers and children. Educarers provide children with a rich variety of activities and experiences, including visits to the local library, local parks, and places of interest. The programme is also enhanced by several educarers who have formal teaching qualifications and experience within the education sector. Learning programmes effectively promote children&rsquo;s language development, mathematical knowledge and social competencies.</p><p>Home environments: In the homes visited by ERO, educarers had worked hard to provide interesting, well-organised learning environments. Thoughtful consideration is given to the placing of children in family homes. Children are confident and experience success in meaningful learning contexts.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO and the service agree that there is a need to further strengthen the service&rsquo;s professional leadership. Particular areas to focus on are to implement:</p><ul>
<li>effective self-review practices including monitoring of possible health and safety hazards in some home environments</li>
<li>staff appraisal for all staff</li>
<li>meaningful bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Bizzy Buddyz Waikato completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practices management should implement appraisal processes for all staff.</p><p>The service should ensure that:</p><ol>
<li>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious image or damage are secured<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6.</em></li>
<li>action is taken to eliminate hazards to the safety of children caused by unprotected electrical sockets and appliances.<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, H11</em></li>
</ol><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the service management agree there is a need to access external guidance and development to strengthen professional leadership in self-review and staff-appraisal practices.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>7 April 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
