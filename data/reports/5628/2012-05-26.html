<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road operates between 8.30 am and 2.30 pm. It provides care and education for children over the age of two.</p><p>Children come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and for some English is their second language. All teachers at the Kindergarten are fully registered and early childhood trained.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes. They have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p>Since the centre&rsquo;s last ERO review in September 2008 the head teacher and teachers have continued to work on further developing aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programmes and practices. This has resulted in ongoing improvements to the quality of education and care for children.</p><p>Features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the extensive range of learning experiences provided for children</li>
<li>the degree to which the programme is based on children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the extent to which children are involved in sustained creative play</li>
<li>the quality of the kindergarten environment and facilities, along with children&rsquo;s ready access to a wide variety of resources</li>
<li>the good use made of aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment information and self-review findings to help improve programmes and practices.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s education service manager and ERO agree that the next steps to further improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the purpose and effectiveness of formal group teaching sessions</li>
<li>continuing to improve aspects of planning and assessment.</li>
</ul><p>Leadership and management practices help to foster team work and collaboration.</p><p>The kindergarten actively promotes good relationships with parents/caregivers and wh&#257;nau and this helps to foster a sense of partnership.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the kindergarten&rsquo;s last ERO review in 2008 the head teacher and teachers have continued to work on improving aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programmes and practices.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h4>Learning experiences</h4><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s programme provides children with an extensive range of learning opportunities. Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the extent to which children can be creative and follow their interests</li>
<li>the wide range of activities children are able to choose from</li>
<li>the good opportunities children have to either play on their own or with others</li>
<li>the adaptations made to the programme in response to children&rsquo;s emerging needs.</li>
</ul><p>Children come from a variety of cultural backgrounds. Aspects of their cultures are appropriately integrated into the kindergarten&rsquo;s programme.</p><p>Reviewers observed children initiating and involving themselves in creative play for prolonged periods. Children played well, both independently and with their peers.</p><h4>Aspects of teaching</h4><p>ERO observed teachers using a range of effective teaching practices. These included:</p><ul>
<li>the way teachers often took part and supported children in their play</li>
<li>informal conversations with children that supported their language development, problem solving skills and independence</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; responsiveness to children&rsquo;s interests and ideas.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers interacted with children in ways that helped foster their confidence and sense of well-being.</p><p>Informative and well-presented children&rsquo;s portfolios help to record and report their success, acknowledge and affirm their progress and often identified possible next steps in their learning and development.</p><h4>Learning Environment</h4><p>Teachers provide children with a positive, supportive environment.</p><p>Reviewers observed many instances of:</p><ul>
<li>teachers responding well to children&rsquo;s immediate needs</li>
<li>respectful, supportive relationships between teachers and children and among children</li>
<li>children playing cooperatively and at times solving issues with their peers independently.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten provides children with a spacious, well presented and interesting indoor and outdoor environment.</p><p>Children have ready access to a wide range of activities and resources that often help to stimulate their interests, provide them with a wide range of choices and help support their engagement in creative play.</p><h4>Relationships with parents, caregivers and wh&#257;nau</h4><p>ERO observed positive interactions between teachers and parents/caregivers and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Teachers have been proactive in reviewing and developing practices that promote a sense of partnership with parents. These include:</p><ul>
<li>taking time to establish and build relationships that foster a sense of partnership</li>
<li>using the information parents share to make links between children&rsquo;s life at home and the kindergarten programme</li>
<li>involving parents, their interests and skills, in aspects of the programme</li>
<li>actively involving parents in contributing to children&rsquo;s learning portfolios</li>
<li>being responsive to the personal circumstances and needs of parents/wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Group Times</h4><p>Reviewers observed children being less effectively involved in learning in some formal group activities than in other aspects of the centre&rsquo;s programme. This was partly a result of the restricted range of teaching practices used during some of these group times.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers should review the purpose of group times, the range of teaching practices used and children&rsquo;s level of engagement in these activities. It would be useful to consider what elements of these group sessions could be better integrated into less formal aspects of the programme.</p><h4>Planning and assessment practices</h4><p>Teachers have established some useful planning and reflective practices. ERO agrees with the current emphasis they are giving to improving aspects of their longer term programme planning.</p><p>Particular consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>clarifying what counts as effective programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>how to better use some of the information teachers gain from their assessments of individual children into the programme plans.</li>
</ul><p>Wider use of some of the very good assessment practices in most portfolios would help to develop greater consistency in the quality of these practices.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>4 May 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-hawthornden-road" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road operates between 8.30 am and 2.30 pm. It provides care and education for children over the age of two.</p><p>Children come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and for some English is their second language. All teachers at the Kindergarten are fully registered and early childhood trained.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes. They have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p>Since the centre&rsquo;s last ERO review in September 2008 the head teacher and teachers have continued to work on further developing aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programmes and practices. This has resulted in ongoing improvements to the quality of education and care for children.</p><p>Features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the extensive range of learning experiences provided for children</li>
<li>the degree to which the programme is based on children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the extent to which children are involved in sustained creative play</li>
<li>the quality of the kindergarten environment and facilities, along with children&rsquo;s ready access to a wide variety of resources</li>
<li>the good use made of aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment information and self-review findings to help improve programmes and practices.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s education service manager and ERO agree that the next steps to further improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the purpose and effectiveness of formal group teaching sessions</li>
<li>continuing to improve aspects of planning and assessment.</li>
</ul><p>Leadership and management practices help to foster team work and collaboration.</p><p>The kindergarten actively promotes good relationships with parents/caregivers and wh&#257;nau and this helps to foster a sense of partnership.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
