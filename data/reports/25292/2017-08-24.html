</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below. </p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lighthouse Preschool's licence has veryrecently been extended to cater for 55 children. The majority of children enrolled are Pākehā and there is a large group of children of Chinese heritage. Staff reflect some of the cultures of families and children attending the service.</p><p>The service has recently had a new owner, supervisor and teaching team. Most teachers are certificated and three are provisionally certificated. A cook provides meals daily and an external administrator supports service operations.</p><p>Teachers make use of the spacious indoor and outdoor environment to provide planned and free play activities for children. There are separate indoor and outdoor areas provided for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The service philosophy (developed by the previous teaching team) is underpinned by the principles and theories of Reggio Emilia, Montessori and <em>Te Whāriki</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood curriculum.</p><p>The areas for improvement identified in the 2014 ERO evaluation are ongoing priorities for the service. These include focussing on children's strengths and interests in programme planning and assessment, and strengthening internal evaluation to inform strategic planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, including infants and toddlers, are well cared for and each has a primary caregiver. Children are encouraged to make choices in their play and select from activities teachers prepare for them. Strategies for enhancing the skills, knowledge and learning dispositions of individual children are currently being investigated by teachers. Teachers have participated in useful professional learning to build their capacity to plan and assess individual children's progress.</p><p>Building positive relationships with families is something teachers continue to focus upon. They encourage parents to contribute to internal evaluation for ongoing service improvement. Teachers are also developing closer working relationships with local schools and a local kindergarten. In addition, they are using a variety of excursions as a way to extend the service's and children's community connections.</p><p>Children are being supported to learn about, and build their knowledge of New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Te reo Māori is used increasingly during mat times and in learning stories as teachers' knowledge and confidence with te reo Māori grows. Some specific tikanga Māori is also practiced during the day. Children are encouraged to engage in tuakana/teina relationships where older and more expert children lead and support their younger peers. Strategies that support Māori children to succeed as Māori are beginning to be developed.</p><p>Children's diverse cultures are valued and their home languages are encouraged. Children have many opportunities to participate in a variety of cultural celebrations, including events like the National Language Week promotions. Teachers could consider additional ways to promote different Pacific languages and cultures.</p><p>The new supervisor has the capacity to grow her leadership skills and build the teaching practices of her team. External professional development could support her leadership growth. She and the teaching team are focused on improvement. They are very reflective about their practice and are building internal evaluation skills.</p><p>The service curriculum includes opportunities for children to engage in experiences that interest them as well as teacher led experiences. The programme promotes physical health and wellbeing. It provides increasing opportunities for children to extend their literacy, mathematical and science skills and knowledge within the context of play. Teachers are very responsive to the requirements of children with diverse needs.</p><p>Teachers are currently building their capability to assess and progress individual children's learning through the use of learning stories and newly implemented individual plans. Better documenting how they respond to children's specific interests, learning and dispositions over time would be a timely next step.</p><p>The owner has established governance strategies that have the potential to help sustain good practices. These include a policy framework that is updated as needed. The newly implemented strategic and annual plans, and an appropriate budget, guide the direction of the service. The owner agrees that it could be useful to align the strategic plan with internal evaluation to identify the impact of ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and supervisor agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy to ensure it aligns with current team practices</li>
<li>building teacher capability to respond to children's interests and to extend their learning</li>
<li>increasing the visibility of children's cultural backgrounds in assessment records</li>
<li>developing a framework for the appraisal of teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should also evaluate how well the formal extension programme for four-year-olds and the transition to school policy align with the aims and principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lighthouse Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lighthouse Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>24 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
