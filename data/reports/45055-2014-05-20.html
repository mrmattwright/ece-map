</table><p>The service is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fingerprints Christian Preschool continues to provide high-quality education and care, in a mixed-age setting, for children from two years old to school age. An increase has occurred in the enrolment of two year olds in recent times. Children from all faiths and cultures attend. Almost a quarter of these children have MƒÅori heritage. The teaching team also reflects the diverse cultures of the centre‚Äôs community.</p><p>The centre is located near a Christian-based school sharing a boundary and gate which allows children to join in easily with some school events and activities.</p><p>The centre philosophy, strongly evident in practice, recognises the uniqueness of each child and the important role parents and teachers have in helping all children to reach their potential. Leaders and teachers value children‚Äôs identity, language and culture and actively foster their mana and wairua.</p><p>Partnership in learning with parents/whƒÅnau is a strong feature of the centre‚Äôs practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Caring, responsive and respectful relationships support children‚Äôs sense of themselves as successful learners. In particular, an inclusive, sensitive approach helps to ensure that children with different learning challenges are able to participate fully in the programme.</p><p>The care and wellbeing of two-year-old children is given prominence to ensure that they develop a strong sense of belonging and confidence.</p><p>The MƒÅori concepts of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga are highly visible in the curriculum and teaching practices. Ako and tuakana teina are fostered to give children opportunities to share their knowledge and skills with others. Through regular and meaningful experiences, children are developing a growing understanding and use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>The majority of the programme is child led. Teachers know children well and make good use of their observations and knowledge of each child to extend their learning. Teachers seek children‚Äôs views in a variety of ways and involve them in decisions that affect them.</p><p>Teachers provide an environment that is attractive, welcoming and organised to stimulate children‚Äôs curiosity and exploration. Teachers promote children‚Äôs independence and use of self-management skills. A wide range of purposeful resources are available for children to use to build on their interests and ideas.</p><p>Children participate in many varied experiences within and outside the centre that are relevant to their interests and lives. Literacy and numeracy learning are well integrated in children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Teachers regularly share rich and detailed information with parents and children about children‚Äôs learning and progress. Teachers work closely with parents to identify learning goals and how to help children achieve them. Children‚Äôs learning stories also contain specific information about how teachers will add value to their learning.</p><p>The centre benefits from high-quality management and leadership. Centre leaders strongly advocate for all learners. They have high expectations for teaching and learning. Leaders actively foster a team approach to decision making and a shared understanding of the centre‚Äôs vision and goals. Teachers are well supported to achieve these expectations. Extensive professional development is being used effectively to make ongoing improvements to the programme and practices.</p><p>Self review is valued, well informed by current research, and focused on centre priorities. Teachers are encouraged to critically reflect on their teaching and make any necessary changes to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on the many good practices already in place, ERO has identified that planning for the future direction of the centre should clearly show the centre‚Äôs priorities and goals for the next three to five years and how these will be achieved.</p><p>The centre leaders have identified that</p><ul>
<li>programme evaluation could be developed further</li>
<li>children could have a greater involvement in assessing their own learning</li>
<li>the views of parents about teaching and learning could be gathered more widely.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fingerprints Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fingerprints Christian Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>20 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
