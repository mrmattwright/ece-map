</table><p>Good progress has been made in addressing some key aspects of practice. However, these have yet to be embedded. A priority for this service is to ensure that systems and processes for the continuous monitoring of health and safety requirements are in place.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Happy Days Childcare Centre is a privately owned early childhood service located in Upper Hutt. It is licensed to cater for 75 children, including up to 45 aged under two years. Of the 53 children attending, 19 are MƒÅori and seven are from Pacific ethnic groups. The local community is culturally diverse.</p><p>The Chief Executive Officer owns and runs the service with the support of a business advisory group. A centre manager is responsible for staff and curriculum leadership. Of the 11 staff employed, seven are registered teachers. Four support staff work alongside teachers helping with children and undertaking domestic duties.</p><p>The June 2014 ERO review found significant development was needed particularly in relation to provision for children aged up to two years, implementation of bicultural curriculum, the quality of teaching and planning for children's learning, staff appraisal, and teachers' understanding and use of self review. In addition some of the impact surfacing in the outdoor playground, hazard management and aspects of the curriculum were deemed non-compliant.</p><p>The teaching team has received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, <em>Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities</em> (SELO).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Staff are responsive and warm in their interactions with children. They work together well to ensure that children are settled and their care requirements are met. A positive tone is evident. There is a need to strengthen the quality and use of intentional teaching strategies to support children's sustained engagement in learning experiences. Using care routines as part of the learning programme should provide additional opportunities for adults' one-to-one engagement with children.</p><p>Children are enthusiastic learners, keen to investigate the resources and activities available. Management should consider improving resourcing, particularly in relation to materials that promote investigation and creativity. Maximising children's access to a wide range of learning materials and enabling them to make more choices about their learning, should strengthen their purposeful engagement in the programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from the consistent attention of familiar adults who know them well. In 2016 whole-centre professional development is planned to support ongoing improvement to provision for these youngest children. The reorganisation of the indoor space into two areas, one for children aged under three years and one for those aged from three to five, is improving outcomes for both groups particularly in relation to their wellbeing, sense of belonging and ease of transitions into and through the centre.</p><p>Some acknowledgment of other cultures is evident in displays and supported by the ethnically diverse staff. The manager reports that recent professional development has promoted understanding of some suitable ways to work with MƒÅori learners. Consideration of the Ministry of Education's <em>Pasifika Education Plan</em> should strengthen understanding of the needs of Pacific learners. The manager acknowledges that the service needs to continue to develop links with local MƒÅori to support understanding of te ao MƒÅori and the development of a more bicultural learning programme.</p><p>Some progress is being made to improve planning for learning. A more individualised approach is in the early stage of development and includes ongoing evaluation of each child‚Äôs progress. A best practice example shows how a teacher notices, recognises and responds in meaningful ways to a child's significant interests and parents' and whƒÅnau aspirations. Well-presented portfolios have been reintroduced to support children's reflection on their participation and achievements. Further work is needed to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>shared teacher understanding about the new approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for teachers to share information about individuals to better support each child's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultural perspectives in children's learning portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents' and whƒÅnau input and children's ownership of their portfolios.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should continue to develop the quality of evaluation of the group programme to inform decisions about next planning steps for individuals and the group.</p><p>The teaching team should collaboratively research best-practice early childhood guidelines to further develop the quality of the approach to supporting children's transition to primary school.</p><p>Understanding and use of internal evaluation continues to need development at centre and management level. A suitable framework has been developed and is in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>Teamwork is increasingly cohesive. Staff leadership opportunities are being created to enhance outcomes in both areas of the centre. The manager continues to seek appropriate professional development to improve centre practices.</p><p>A mentor has been identified to support implementation of suitable performance management processes for teachers. Effective implementation of the revised teacher appraisal process is needed, including:</p><p>regular constructive feedback for all staff based on targeted observations of their practice and linked to their specific development goals</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the development of evidential files supporting endorsement of each teacher's practising certificate.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Implementation of an appropriate induction and mentoring programme for provisionally certificated teachers, and ensuring staff have sufficient time to effectively meet the expectations required of them in their teaching roles, should assist to improve the quality of teaching.</p><p>Progress has been made in relation to planning for the sustainability of the quality of the service, operation and teacher capability. The philosophy and strategic and annual plans now clearly outline centre priorities. Further work should be undertaken to define the desired outcomes of the identified initiatives. Undertaking regular evaluation of practice in relation to these desired outcomes should better support decisions about next development steps.</p><p>The manager agrees that policies and procedures should be reviewed to support more consistent staff understanding and implementation of centre expectations. The further definition of management and administration requirements and development of associated reporting and review processes, should provide assurance, at governance level, that accountabilities are being met.</p><p>Leaders must focus on promoting and sustaining good practice. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the collaborative review and further definition of the philosophy and strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers‚Äô shared understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the implementation of the revised teacher appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development of an induction and mentoring programme for provisionally certificated teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing written guidelines, particularly to support curriculum and management practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focused support for the manager's leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there should be a continued focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of the learning environment and quality of teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development of a more bicultural curriculum and ways to best support MƒÅori learners.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommends that suitable support is sought to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>mentor and appraise the manager in her leadership role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assist the manager and CEO progress implementation of robust systems that sustain and promote improvements to practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Happy Days Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service relating to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em> must be met when employing core workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable human resource management practices must be implemented, including a system of regular appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>information is provided to parents about the amount and details of the expenditure of any Ministry of Education funding received by the service</p>
</li>
</ul><p>an effective quality assurance process should be put in place to support ongoing compliance with legislative requirements for provision of early childhood education and care.¬†</p><p><em>[Vulnerable Children Act 2014, Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, GMA3, Reg 46 1(a) HS11]</em></p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appropriate permission is sought from parents and whƒÅnau about the use of their children's photographs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Happy Days Childcare Centre. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Happy Days Childcare Centre will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>31 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
