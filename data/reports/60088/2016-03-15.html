</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Co Kids Basin Reserve is located in central Wellington and is licensed to provide education and care for 46 children, including 25 under two years of age. Changes since the November 2012 ERO report include a new name for the service, and in 2015, the appointment of a new centre manager.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board of directors. The manager acts as the link between the board and the centre. She oversees the day-to-day running of the service.</p><p>The teaching philosophy states the shared values of managers and educators that promote positive, child-teacher-family relationships to successfully support the development of children's identity.</p><p>Three of the teaching team members have an early childhood qualification and full teacher registration. One primary-trained teacher has provisional registration.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review the manager and educators have made some progress in strengthening internal evaluation, assessment and planning and te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. These areas continue to require further refinement and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between children, educators and parents are warm, caring and supportive. Adults use suitable strategies to engage children in purposeful and sustained play. They are generally involved in children's learning, through respectful conversations that often encourage their thinking, problem-solving and exploration.</p><p>Assessment and planning are increasingly responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and diverse cultures. Children, with English as their second language, are well supported. Mathematics and literacy are meaningfully included in the programme. Profiles are records of learners‚Äô participation and progress in activities of choice. Observations of children in everyday activities support building a picture of what they know, understand, feel and can do. An online programme has the potential to improve educators‚Äô and parents‚Äô communication about children‚Äôs learning. This is in the early stages of implementation and is an area of ongoing development.</p><p>Programmes for very young children focus on nurturing wellbeing through responsive caregiving. Play is valued as a vehicle for learning. There are ample opportunities for infants and toddlers to be active communicators and explorers within the spacious environment. Routines are unhurried and these are an enjoyable and important part of children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the curriculum continue to develop. The manager and educators recognise the need to further build their capability and understandings of culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Transitions into and between the two areas in the centre are flexible and responsive to the needs of individual children and families. A school transition programme supports educators to enhance outcomes for children as they move to school.</p><p>A new appraisal system is being introduced. It is developmental and informs professional learning opportunities for teachers. Further exploration of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> should enhance teaching practice and understanding of a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes continue to evolve. The manager and educators are developing their understandings of review for improvement. Strategic planning requires strengthening. The focus of the plan is on centre operation and contains broad teaching and learning objectives. Consideration should be given to collaboratively developing a plan with managers, educators and parents to identify priorities and associated goals to strengthen centre operations and teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and educators should:</p><ul>
<li>embed new assessment and planning practices and evaluate children‚Äôs progress over time</li>
<li>consider developing a shared philosophy for teaching and learning for the service‚Äôs youngest children</li>
<li>continue to develop and use internal evaluation more effectively to inquire into the effectiveness of teaching to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>review current strategic planning, including revising the annual plan to better guide future development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Co Kids Basin Reserve completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Co Kids Basin Reserve will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
