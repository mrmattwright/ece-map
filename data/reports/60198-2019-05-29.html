</table><p>Waikanae Montessori Preschool¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO found a number of non-compliances with the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008. A number of key policies have not been reviewed and updated and self review requires development.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikanae Montessori Preschool is an all-day early childhood and care service. It is licensed for 40 children aged from two to six years. Of the 59 children currently enrolled, seven identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>A governance committee is responsible for the centre. An administrator supports the board of trustees, the parent committee and centre staff. Since 2018, an acting manager has had responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the service. The board has recently reviewed the constitution charter. This has informed the future leadership structure.</p><p>The centre is organised into two mixed age classrooms. Since the beginning of 2018 the service has begun to enrol two year olds.</p><p>While some of the key next steps from the April 2016 ERO report have been addressed; assessment for learning and internal evaluation continues to require development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki (2017),</em> the Early Childhood Curriculum, blended with Montessori principles, is becoming increasingly visible in the enacted curriculum. Recent professional development has helped staff recognise the importance of reviewing their philosophy statement. This is a priority.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in the variety of experiences available within the prepared environments. The well-designed outdoor spaces invite exploration and provide challenge.</p><p>Learning partnerships with parents are being appropriately developed. Leaders and teachers understand the importance of gathering parent and whƒÅnau aspirations, and work collaboratively and responsively to enact them. Parents are asked for and regularly give their input in the termly statements about their child's participation in the programme.</p><p>Assessment portfolios do not clearly nor consistently reflect MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture. Teacher's need to build their knowledge and confidence to effectively support the success of these young learners.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga Maori is being effectively promoted by an external facilitator. He is supporting the development of links to the local Marae.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported in an inclusive environment. External agencies are accessed as required.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are well considered. Teachers are particularly responsive to how well young children settle. With an influx of younger children into the centre teachers have appropriately revised practices and have provided suitable age-appropriate resources in the environment.</p><p>Understanding of self review and internal evaluation is at an early stage and requires development. While both long term and spontaneous reviews are undertaken, processes are needed to support their implementation and completion.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and centre managers agree, that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen understanding of assessment for learning practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop shared understandings of self review and internal evaluation at all levels to better inform decision making.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikanae Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the child protection policy needs updating to ensure it meets all the requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a written procedure is needed for the safety checking of all workers before they have access to children, that meets the requirements of the VCA 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>key systems for supervision are fully implemented and monitored.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS31, GMA7A, HS22</em></p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appraisal is fully developed and robustly implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an appropriate schedule for the review of all policies is developed, implemented and maintained. When policies are reviewed, it is important to ensure they match practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual planning is adequately documented.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>29 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
