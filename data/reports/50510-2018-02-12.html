</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Inglewood Community Childcare Centre Inc is located in Inglewood, near New Plymouth. The centre operates as a non-profit incorporated society, offering families all day education and care for 67 children, including 15 children up to two years of age. Of the 95 children enrolled, 21 are Māori.</p><p>The purpose-built centre caters for three age groups in specific areas. A central deck provides a communal space for group interaction. The centre manager has responsibility for all three areas. Two head teachers oversee curriculum for up to two year olds and those over two. The leadership team work together to implement the strategic goals of the committee of elected parents.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by a commitment to education through play.  </p><p>Areas identified for development in the October 2013 ERO report have been positively and actively progressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in a rich play-based curriculum that supports their exploration as curious, collaborative learners. They demonstrate a strong sense of ownership within an environment that is spacious, inviting and encourages cooperative play.</p><p>The centre is well-resourced with an array of flexible, open-ended and natural equipment that foster children’s learning. Extensive opportunities for community excursions and cultural celebrations are a valuable part of the programme.</p><p>Teachers engage in respectful, individualised interactions with children. They know children and families well. This supports the considered focus on the provision of quality practices for children and families. Routines are calm, unhurried and flexible to children's preferences.</p><p>Infant and toddler learning is well supported through careful observation, intentional teaching and strong partnerships with families.  Teachers work respectfully with these children. They observe and respond to their interests and preferences. There is a wide range of engaging sensory experiences offered that invites their participation. Free movement and active exploration are well promoted. </p><p>The teaching team is strongly committed to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and its implications for a bicultural curriculum. Teachers are successfully growing their practice in this area, and are well supported by leaders. Positive relationships with local iwi and marae have been established. Children regularly see, hear and experience te reo me ngā tikanga Māori within the programme.</p><p>Teachers liaise effectively with parents and outside agencies, where appropriate, to support the learning and well-being of children with diverse needs.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes are well developed and make effective use of online systems. Teachers are highly reflective practitioners who closely observe children's interests over time and work alongside parents to support learning. They regularly document and celebrate children's unique skills and dispositions.</p><p>ERO recommends, and leaders agree, that individual assessment, planning and evaluation should be strengthened to show:</p><ul>
<li>how teachers plan specific, complex teaching strategies to extend the learning of individuals</li>
<li>how teachers use information from families to enrich learning.</li>
</ul><p>These developments should support staff to implement targeted, culturally responsive strategies to support educational success for tamariki Māori.</p><p>The centre has a strong presence in the community and has continued to develop reciprocal relationships with local schools through their involvement with the Kāhui Ako o Kōhanga Moa ǀ Inglewood Community of Learning.  They are making a significant contribution to promoting early childhood education in this community of learning.</p><p>Approaches to strategic planning and organisational management are highly organised and robust. The introduction of an online system, after a thorough review, has streamlined aspects of documentation, communication and system organisation. Operational and curriculum planning is consistently aligned with key outcomes identified by the organisation. </p><p>Internal evaluation contributes to sustained and improved outcomes for children. Leaders and managers demonstrate highly effective practice. They regularly identify and monitor areas for improvement and actively support and grow leadership capacity within staff. They place emphasis on having a collaborative, solutions-focused team culture.</p><p>Teachers and leaders share their practice and have developed a culture of inquiry and professional critique. Appraisals promote continuous improvement and all staff engage in investigations that result in positive change.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has confidence in the service’s capacity to promote ongoing improvements. Leaders agree that priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>implementing targeted strategies for promoting the educational success of Māori learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Inglewood Community Childcare Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Inglewood Community Childcare Centre Inc will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>12 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
