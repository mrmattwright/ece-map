</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre is privately owned and is located in a residential area of Onerahi, close to Whangarei. The purpose-built centre has been open for 5 years. It provides education and care for up to 50 children, including up to 16 under two years of age.</p><p>Children are cared for in three developmental/age-related groups. Placement in these groupings is decided depending on children's individual physical, cognitive, social and emotional development and their general wellbeing. A special feature of the centre's programme is the 'Bush School' which operates two days a week for older children. Children spend time learning and exploring trees and creeks in the bush.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted that teachers could improve planning systems and increase the usefulness of centre documentation about children's learning. It also recommended that, in order to improve management and strategic planning, centre managers could increase the use of staff reflections, performance appraisal and self-review processes to further build staff capability.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are generally happy and confident. They experience a broad range of learning options. Children are given time to appreciate nature by being actively immersed in natural environments. Bush School provides children with opportunities to develop self-help, negotiation, problem-solving and social skills. Children enjoy positive learning experiences during their time at Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre that prepare them for their progression to school.</p><p>Toddlers and younger children are well supported. They benefit from very good teacher-to-child ratios. Their language and wider development is encouraged through good opportunities for conversation with teachers.</p><p>Children's holistic development, including social, emotional and physical aspects, is promoted and they are learning about making healthy food choices. They respond well to routines and help with tidying up at meal times. They appear very comfortable and confident in the centre.</p><p>Parents and teachers have respectful and collaborative relationships. Staff communicate effectively with families using a variety of on-line digital strategies and centre managers continue to explore further communication options.</p><p>Diversity is positively acknowledged and well supported in the centre. All children and their families are affirmed as respected members of the centre. Bicultural values are practised and promoted. Tuakana/teina relationships between older and younger children are encouraged. Bicultural understandings form a base on which other cultures are explored and celebrated.</p><p>The centre philosophy has been developed cooperatively by parents and teachers. It affirms the importance of family, the natural environment and the importance of providing children with time to explore, respond to challenges, and problem-solve as they work and play. Creativity and imaginative play are promoted to strengthen children's thinking and learning skills.</p><p>Teachers have opportunities to develop their leadership skills. Teachers do this by sharing the leadership of a range of projects that enable their professional and management skills to develop. The centre's performance appraisal system also helps teachers to focus on individual areas where their teaching practice can be improved and extended.</p><p>Teachers are well qualified and registered. They work together to build one another's professional understanding and knowledge and by sharing research articles. Individual and group planning is based on children's interests. Teachers know about children's individual strengths, needs and cultural backgrounds. Teachers keep up to date with local developments and challenges by their participation in a network of education and community organisations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to further improve learning outcomes for children managers could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>progress leadership training for centre leaders and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen programme planning by using high quality indicators of good practice as a guide.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
