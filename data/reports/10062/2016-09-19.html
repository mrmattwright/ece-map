</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata is located on the grounds of Henderson South Primary School. It is licensed for 50 children including no more than 10 under 2 years of age. The aoga roll is currently at half capacity.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata Trust Board, a registered charity. The board has been inactive in its governance role since the 2013 ERO review.</p><p>The aoga philosophy sets out to promote Samoan culture, Christian values and a commitment to<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Samoan, English and Maori languages are evident in the centre.</p><p>Despite the decreasing roll the aoga continues to support high staff ratios, employing a centre manager, four certificated teachers, three teacher assistants and a kitchen hand. Most of the staff are long serving.</p><p>Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata has had a history of two supplementary ERO reviews. The 2013 ERO review found that very good progress had been made. This review finds that these positive developments have not been sustained. The board is not meeting legal or licensing requirements. ERO has identified significant risk to the sustainability of the aoga and recommends that the Ministry of Education reassess the licence of Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are involved in simple play activities and are respectful and compliant learners. Much of their programme is structured, teacher-directed activity. There are few opportunities for children to initiate their own play.</p><p>The environment for children under two years of age was sparsely resourced on the day of the review. Teachers should ensure that infants and toddlers are always provided with a comfortable setting that stimulates independent exploration and encourages their sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers have not sustained professional support to help them evaluate programmes. They do not reflect on, consider and change their teaching responses. Some teachers work alongside children. Other teachers supervise children from afar and do not support children‚Äôs learning well.</p><p>Teachers must implement a learning programme that is consistent with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They should strengthen their professional practice to support and deepen children's learning through play.</p><p>The manager and teachers have not been appraised annually.</p><p>Strategic and annual management plans have been developed by the centre manager and one trustee without consultation with the board, staff and parents.</p><p>A plan for improvement at all levels of aoga operations should be developed and implemented.</p><p>Aoga governance is ineffective. Trustees are not meeting regularly to ensure that the board is meeting legal and licensing requirements.</p><p>There is no evidence of an annual general meeting being held. Several concerns including conflicts of interest regarding financial management have been identified in the 2015 financial audit.</p><p>The board requires external support to fulfil its roles and responsibilities as trustees and to proactively facilitate a shared vision for the centre's development.</p><p>More effective internal evaluation should be carried out by the board, manager and teachers to make informed decisions and identify priorities for development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>effective governance and management in accordance with good management practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-review and planning to guide the centre's operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adults' understanding of children's learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning, implementing and evaluating a curriculum that is designed to enhance children's learning and development through the provision of learning experiences and that are consistent with <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> GMA3<em>,</em> GMA4<em>,</em> GMA6, GMA7, C1, C7.</p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taulapapa Leata Su'a Aoga Amata will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>19 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
