</table><p>Rosebank Early Childhood Centre requires external assistance to improve governance, management and financial practices. Teachers would benefit from ongoing support to develop a more child-led curriculum that responds to children‚Äôs interests and developmental stages.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rosebank Early Childhood Centre is located in the grounds of Rosebank Road School in Avondale, Auckland. The centre caters for 25 children over the age of two years. It operates daily from 8.00am to 3.30pm. This is the centre‚Äôs second ERO review and it has been open for six years.</p><p>Most children and families who attend are of Pacific heritage. The service promotes Samoan language and operates a bilingual programme. All teachers speak Samoan with children for large parts of the day. Many children progress from this centre to the schools‚Äô Samoan bilingual unit.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2012 report, a new head teacher and two new teachers have been appointed. Staff changes have made it difficult to progress areas for development. Significant external support is now essential to raise the quality of the programme for children.</p><p>The service is governed by an experienced early childhood educator and a teacher from the school‚Äôs bilingual unit. They work in close partnership. They have identified a number of improvements that need to be made and welcome external support with this task.</p><p>The service is extending its facilities to add space for an additional 15 children, including up to six under two. It is important that improvements are in place before the increase in licensing numbers. The development of a shared understanding among staff about effective teaching practices is essential.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly and have positive social interactions with each other. They show enthusiasm in their learning and are confident, capable learners. Children benefit from a welcoming environment where their families are also welcome to stay and participate in their learning.</p><p>Parents report they value the way teachers support their children‚Äôs culture and identity. They note that their children are now speaking Samoan more often at home, appreciate how communication with the centre has improved, and receive very good support from teachers and management. Teachers are working hard to improve relationships with parents and have established a parent/teacher group to encourage parent participation and input.</p><p>Teachers are caring and offer comfort to children. They have positive interactions with children and promote children's sense of belonging. Teachers are gradually developing the programme so that for parts of the day it connects purposefully to promote individual children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>The learning environment is attractive and provides a good range of resources. However, the small size of the environment places some limitations on provisions for children. Continuing to make sure resources are easily accessible to children and used in ways that supports sustained learning should remain a goal. The new outdoor playground is popular and well used by children.</p><p>The programme promotes oral language well. At mat times, children sing and have opportunities for literacy and mathematics learning. Te reo MƒÅori is also used confidently by teachers during mat times. Children would benefit if teachers reviewed the purpose and pace of group times. Finding ways for children to have more input into these times could improve children‚Äôs learning and engagement.</p><p>The centre has a useful management framework and the governance team has identified further improvements that could be made. Teachers could take a greater role in centre management, become more familiar with and better follow centre policies and procedures. Increasing teachers‚Äô accountability for providing high quality teaching and management practices should improve children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders would benefit from targeted support to help them:</p><ul>
<li>use measurable indicators in strategic plans to guide centre evaluation and self review</li>
<li>improve financial and personnel management practices</li>
<li>more clearly distribute governance and management responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers would benefit from ongoing professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure they use resources well to support chilldrens' development and thinking skills</li>
<li>develop and implement a shared teaching philosophy for younger children</li>
<li>increase their use of self review to improve their teaching practices</li>
<li>find additional ways for the programme to support children‚Äôs independence and exploration</li>
<li>better document individual children‚Äôs learning, including progress made and their next learning steps.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rosebank Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, personnel management and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance by ensuring:</p><ul>
<li>the curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children‚Äôs learning and interests</li>
<li>personnel management, employment practices and complaints are well managed</li>
<li>more sustainable financial management practices</li>
<li>the accuracy of daily attendance records</li>
<li>the centre implements effective sun-safe practices</li>
<li>safety risks related to the storage of some items in the indoors areas are addressed.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> C2, C7, PF8, GMA7, GMA11, Education Act, 1989.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rosebank Early Childhood Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
