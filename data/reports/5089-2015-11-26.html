</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papatoetoe Kindergarten provides education and care for children from three to five years of age, from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Approximately a third of the children are Māori or Pacific. Since the last review the kindergarten has been relicensed and now provides a Kindergarten Day Model (KDM) which enables children to attend sessions similar to school hours.</p><p>Papatoetoe Kindergarten and its community are very multicultural. The kindergarten continues to foster its relationship with organisations that provide English language classes for parents/whānau and the wider community and support Hindi, Punjabi and Mandarin speaking families.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report commented positively on the quality of the educational programme and its responsiveness to children’s strengths and interests. The areas identified for review and development related to Māori perspectives, self review, and assessment are being addressed.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides considered leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers.</p><p>In 2015, after extensive review and consultation, the Association launched a new 10 year strategic plan with four key strategic objectives. The Association’s approach to rolling out a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New Association roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergartens. Professional development supports kindergarten head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being implemented to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement in kindergartens.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association. </p><h4>The Review Findings</h4><p>Children often direct their own learning with the support of skilled teaching. Children are confident when engaging with adults. They form friendships and show respect for one another and the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Teachers believe that children learn best through play. They support children’s interests by thoughtful questioning and helping them to access relevant resources. They encourage children to take risks, persevere with learning and to be independent.</p><p>There is a strong sense of whanaungatanga within the kindergarten. The teaching team foster inclusive practices and have built strong, positive relationships with parents and children.</p><p>Children’s cultures are respected and the use of their home languages is valued and supported at the kindergarten by the culturally diverse teaching team. Teachers encourage parents to be involved in the kindergarten and often translate documents into their home languages. This practice enhances children and families' wellbeing and sense of belonging at kindergarten.</p><p>Parents are regularly consulted and encouraged to share the aspirations they have for their children's learning. Parents' aspirations are clearly displayed in the centre and are evident in centre planning and in the learning programmes developed for children. The recent introduction of on-line portfolios has enhanced opportunities for families to contribute to children’s learning.</p><p>Processes for assessing children’s learning and programme planning are being strengthened. Teachers are skilful at recognising children’s learning and revisiting previous assessments to ensure the programme is promoting children’s interests.</p><p>Teachers are considering how they can best support children to set their own learning goals. They could strengthen planning by introducing strategies that teachers could use to promote children’s learning. They could also strengthen programme evaluation by reviewing the impact of the programme on individual children.</p><p>The kindergarten is well led. Teachers are supported to improve their practice though the appraisal process and the professional development provided. Teachers work well together to provide a good quality educational programme. The kindergarten’s annual plan provides clear direction and is used to evaluate progress towards the kindergarten’s strategic goals.</p><p>The head teacher has supported staff to strengthen self review. A recent review of bicultural practices in the centre provides clear direction for how the teachers can support children’s identity as Māori and help all children to feel confident in bicultural Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p>The Association’s systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. Self review in this kindergarten is well used to inform strategic decisions. The Association has a strong commitment to biculturalism and embracing diversity. Resources and personnel have been targeted to ensure that the specific needs of children and their families are met. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Papatoetoe Kindergarten include continuing to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural practices</li>
<li>opportunities for children to set their own learning goals</li>
<li>the use of specific teaching strategies to support children to achieve their goals</li>
<li>leadership opportunities for all staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papatoetoe Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papatoetoe Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>26 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p><p></p><p>ERO has also published an exemplar report on Papatoetoe Kindergarten: <a href="/exemplar-reports/exemplar-review-papatoetoe-kindergarten-june-2018/">Exemplar Review - Papatoetoe Kindergarten - June 2018</a></p>
