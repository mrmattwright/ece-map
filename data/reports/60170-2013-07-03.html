</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre, Porirua, currently caters for 32 children from the Porirua East community who are aged over two years. It provides full-day and sessional care, with most children attending morning sessions. Children come from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds and a range of languages are spoken at home. Three qualified teachers, one provisionally registered, work collaboratively as a team and with children and their families.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review the centre was on a transitional license for working toward meeting the 2008 regulations for early childhood services. It is being well supported by Barnardos New Zealand (Barnardos), to address areas identified for development in the March 2010 ERO report and in the 2012 Ministry of Education relicensing process. Support and professional development has focused on building partnerships with whānau and improving assessment, planning, evaluation and self review.</p><p>Barnardos provides strategic direction and a policy framework to guide centre operation. Recent restructuring of the organisation has resulted in the new positions of business manager and practice leader. They work collaboratively to support centre management of finance and property, monitor health and safety and compliance with legislation and help the centre improve the quality of children's education and care. Day-to-day management and responsibility for the programme is delegated to the head teacher.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three Early Learning Centre reviews under the Barnardos umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a settled, family-like atmosphere in the centre. Teachers talk warmly with children and their families to make them feel welcomed and cared for. Children choose to play independently and with each other. They freely and confidently access resources to follow their interests as they move around play spaces. A large outdoor area provides for their physical play and development. Teachers respond well to children’s ideas and enrich their learning through meaningful conversations as they play.</p><p>Review of the centre philosophy has strengthened teachers’ focus on building partnerships with families and whānau and learning about what they want to happen for their children. They have considered and implemented ways to assist families and children settle into the centre. They work closely with families to support children with special needs.</p><p>Teachers are working to include parents’ contributions and ideas more deliberately into their assessment and planning. Individual learning plans developed for some children provide a useful basis for teaching and learning. Gaining a better understanding of children’s cultural identities and language should better guide teaching strategies and strengthen assessment. The environment should be enriched to reflect the heritage of Pacific children, as well as other cultures represented on the roll.</p><p>Teachers are working to make bicultural aspects of their curriculum stronger. They understand the importance of developing stronger relationships with whānau and the local Māori community. Teachers are building their own understanding and knowledge of te reo Māori, supported by the Barnardos Māori Strategy plan. Strengthening the centre’s approach to supporting Māori children, as Maori, should be a next step.</p><p>The Barnardos organisation has improved communication systems and is establishing clear expectations about the roles and responsibilities of staff. The practice leader is working to build shared understandings of good practice. Appraisal continues to require improvement. A more robust system is being developed to align with strategic goals and the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Staff understanding of effective self review is developing with the support of the practice leader. Positive outcomes of this process are evident and it is likely to be strengthened as there is greater alignment between all aspects of the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and staff need to build on and sustain improvements begun in their assessment, planning and evaluation. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>deliberate use of assessment to plan the programme</li>
<li>commitment to regular assessment and planning for all children</li>
<li>increased focus on reflecting and supporting children’s cultural identities</li>
<li>improved documentation of learning to show progress over time</li>
<li>regular evaluation of children’s learning and the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Implementing an improved performance management system is a priority. This should be accompanied by increased support for leaders and staff to:</p><ul>
<li>set clear, measurable development goals</li>
<li>provide an evidence base for establishing progress towards goals</li>
<li>provide effective mentoring and feedback on observations of practice.</li>
</ul><p>Establishing clear indicators of quality, linked to the Barnardos vision for early childhood education, should guide teachers’ practice and strengthen self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Ctre - Porirua completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The centre is currently addressing areas identified by the Ministry of Education in September 2012 as they transition towards the<em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Early Learning Ctre - Porirua will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>3 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
