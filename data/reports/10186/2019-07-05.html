</table><p>Akaiti Mangarongaro¬†is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Akaiti Mangarongaro requires support to improve the quality of governance, management and programmes, to better promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akaiti Mangarongaro in Mangere provides a Cook Island MƒÅori bilingual education and care service for up to 40 children, including a maximum of eight under two years of age. It was established to promote children's use of the Mangarongaro language and culture. While most of the children are Cook Island MƒÅori, the roll includes children from other Pacific groups and a few from other diverse backgrounds.</p><p>The punanga reo is governed by the Torohata Trust Board, which employs its chairman as operations manager, and another trustee as centre manager. The board also employs four qualified teachers and two support staff. A head teacher oversees teaching and learning.</p><p>In 2013 and 2017, ERO identified teaching and learning, management and self review as key areas to develop. The punanga has had significant Ministry of Education professional development support, but further improvement is required. This review recommends that the Ministry of Education (MoE) reassess the licence of Akaiti Mangarongaro.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children quickly settle into the welcoming environment and show enjoyment in their play. They have opportunities for creative play and access to a range of resources. Children develop positive tuakana/teina relationships in the mixed-age setting.</p><p>Children's languages and cultures are well supported at mat time through interactive songs, prayers and dances. It is timely now for teachers to integrate the Mangarongaro language throughout the programme, to better reflect the bilingual intent of the punanga philosophy. The board, teachers and whƒÅnau should also review the philosophy and include recognition of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa.</p><p>Teachers have improved the environment to provide more stimulating play for infants and toddlers. Comfortable, safe spaces for children who are crawling feature in the indoor and outdoor spaces. Recent planning and assessment documentation show how individual children are supported to progress their interests. Teachers should continue to build on these good beginnings to embed and sustain improvement. Provision for infants and toddlers, and extending older children's learning through more complex play, continue to be priorities for improvement.</p><p>Managers have accessed support to develop operational systems, review policies, and establish appropriate human resource and financial management practices. While progress has recently been made in some aspects of governance and management, clear roles and responsibilities for all staff and trustees have not yet been identified. Ongoing internal evaluation that leads to improved outcomes for children is yet to be established. Significant aspects of management and administration do not comply with legal requirements.</p><p>External professional advisory support is essential for the board, managers and teachers to collaboratively implement new knowledge and sustain improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akaiti Mangarongaro completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to internal evaluation, human resource management and administration. To address these matters the board and managers must establish:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an ongoing process of internal evaluation that helps the service maintain and improve education and care for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable human resource management practices, including a system of regular appraisal that meets Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checking of all children‚Äôs workers who have access to children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies and procedures for assessment and management of risk in relation to excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>records of all medicines given to children, that include the date and time medicine was administered and evidence of parental acknowledgement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>procedures to ensure that the supervision of children meets requirements in regard to qualifications, ratios and service size.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6,7,7A, HS17,28, Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 44; Children's Act 2014.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Akaiti Mangarongaro. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
