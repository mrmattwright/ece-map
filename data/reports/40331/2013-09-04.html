</table><p>Tiaki Early Learning Centre is well placed to continue to promote positive outcomes for all children, including priority learners.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tiaki Early Learning Centre is a privately owned service located in a semi-rural area close to Lake Rotorua. It provides all-day education and care for potiki (infants), teina (toddlers) and tuakana (young children) in a mixed-age, whƒÅnau setting. The centre is licensed for a total of 30 children, including up to 10 who are under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review there were 40 children enrolled, 19 of whom identify as being of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre opened in 2008 and this is its second ERO review. Since the last review in March 2010 the centre has continued to review and refine its approaches to learning and teaching. Significant professional learning and development that has influenced these approaches has included an Education Leadership Project, national conferences and a Reggio Emilia inspired study tour to Australia.</p><p>The centre vision is to ‚Äòwalk softly on the earth‚Äô. This vision sits alongside the intention to, create and maintain respectful relationships with tamariki, parents, whƒÅnau, kaiako, the local community and natural environment. The centre achieved a Bronze Enviro School‚Äôs award in 2012.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre managers have initiated a successful review of the centre‚Äôs vision and philosophy. This has been achieved through an externally facilitated, collaborative process involving centre management, kaiak≈ç and whƒÅnau. The vision and philosophy are underpinned by shared beliefs, values and commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Manaakitanga is a fundamental value that effectively promotes respect for tamariki, whƒÅnau, kaiako and the environment.</p><p>The Tiaki Early Learning Centre curriculum and teachers‚Äô practice reflect a strong belief in all tamariki as capable and competent learners, communicators and decision makers. Significant features of the curriculum and teaching include:</p><ul>
<li>learning opportunities and authentic experiences that value the MƒÅori language and culture. Tamariki MƒÅori demonstrate pride in who they are and their knowledge of themselves, their extended family, iwi and places and events of significance to MƒÅori. Other children benefit and are also fully immersed in learning about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</li>
<li>a strong emphasis on establishing respectful and reciprocal relationships and partnerships between tamariki, kaiak≈ç and whƒÅnau. Parents are encouraged to share their ideas and aspirations and lead aspects of the curriculum</li>
<li>the important place of the centre‚Äôs natural environment and wider community to provide rich and varied opportunities for learning and exploration. Children are developing key concepts, understandings and sense of responsibility about the world they live in</li>
<li>highly attuned and insightful kaiako who show genuine appreciation, understanding and responsiveness to the interests, abilities and characteristics of potiki, teina and tuakana</li>
<li>the meaningful integration of literacy, mathematics, the arts, science and computer technology.</li>
</ul><p>Complexity is added to these learning areas through opportunities to engage in projects that extend children‚Äôs interests, thinking and creativity.</p><p>Waka huia for individual children provide a well-documented record of learning and development over time. This assessment information includes a range of perspectives, children‚Äôs interests and learning dispositions along with parents‚Äô voice and aspirations. A key strategy for the ongoing development of assessment practice is the use of learning stories as a reflection tool for kaiako to consider the implications for their teaching practice. This process is further strengthened through the peer review of documented assessment records. This enhances consistency and quality of assessment information.</p><p>ERO, centre management and teachers agree that there would be benefit in strengthening professional relationships between centre staff and their colleagues in local primary schools. Such relationships and discussions are likely to strengthen understandings about, and links between <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and <em>The</em> <em>New Zealand Curriculum</em> and support positive transitions to school for tamariki and their whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified and centre management agree that it is important for management to:</p><ul>
<li>clearly define delegations, roles and responsibilities for themselves as centre managers, leaders and employers</li>
<li>further develop and extend shared leadership within the wider team</li>
<li>use the newly revised and shared vision as a framework to strengthen centre practices, team culture, and to inform annual and strategic planning and self review</li>
<li>strengthen employment policies and practices in relation to staff recruitment, appointment, professional development and appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre managers continue to access external expertise to assist them to address the next steps identified in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tiaki Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tiaki Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>4 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
