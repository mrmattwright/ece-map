</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Taradale is a private early childhood learning service, owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart, previously known as Kidicorp Ltd, is a large national organisation that owns early childhood learning services throughout New Zealand. A centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre. She is supported by an assistant manager, a head teacher and a business and professional services manager.</p><p>Edukids Taradale is licensed for 65 children, including 25 up to the age of two years. The current roll of 79 children, includes 13 who identify as MƒÅori. The service caters for a diverse community ranging from Taradale through to the wider Napier area.</p><p>The centre has two learning areas that comprise one room for children up to two years old and the other for those over two years.</p><p>The long-established staff has sustained the high quality of the service reported in the March 2014 ERO report. This report recommended that, to strengthen self review, leaders and staff needed to identify the outcomes they wanted and evaluate how effectively these were achieved. This recommendation has been met.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four in BestStart Educare Ltd.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teaching and learning practices in this centre promote positive outcomes for all children. Warm, reciprocal interactions between teachers and children contribute to a positive, settled learning environment. Children appear happy, active and engaged. A strong sense of belonging is evident.</p><p>Teachers' respectful and collaborative practices result in a calm, nurturing atmosphere where children, parents and families feel welcome and valued. Children‚Äôs learning is effectively extended through their participation in discussions, activities and problem-solving tasks. Literacy, mathematics and science are strongly promoted.</p><p>Children play cooperatively and also have opportunities for quiet, independent play. The environment for children up to the age of two is peaceful and teachers have a calm, unhurried approach.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners. They have sound curriculum knowledge and their practice reflects the centre philosophy.</p><p>Prompts, artefacts, murals and natural resources in the centre reflect an Aotearoa New Zealand environment. Teachers' and leaders' commitment to implementing a bicultural curriculum is evident in practice. They have a clear understanding of strategies and approaches to promote educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>The centre's curriculum is effectively designed to respond to the strengths, interests and needs of all children. Teachers have a collaborative and visual approach to planning for learning that is inclusive of parents' contributions. Outcomes are documented in children's e-portfolios. These are attractively presented with photographs that show the wide range of activities in which children participate. There is evidence in the portfolios of continuity of learning, as well as extension of children's emerging interests and strengths. Teachers have rightly identified the need for, and have introduced, hard copies of portfolios to enable children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Children's transitions within and from the centre are well considered and made in collaboration with parents and whƒÅnau. The centre's transition programme supports children to move smoothly from the centre to school.</p><p>Leadership is a strength in this centre. Leaders effectively build capability within the service to promote positive outcomes for children. There is a strong improvement culture and a well-established internal evaluation process. Teachers deliberately inquire into their own practice, using current research as a guide. Purposeful plans are put in place with a strong focus on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The service is very well placed to promote and sustain quality improvement. Teachers are effectively supported by BestStart Ltd. Appraisal is robust and consistent with the New Zealand Education Council expectations. The professional services manager and business manager regularly review and report on professional, financial and compliance matters. This support enables the centre manager and teachers to focus on delivering the curriculum and sustaining and improving centre operation.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and management have identified that the next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>to become more familiar with the <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017</em></li>
<li>continue to develop and use effective internal evaluation processes to drive change that benefits all children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Taradale completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Taradale will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
