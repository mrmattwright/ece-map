</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Green Bay Kindergarten is licenced for 40 children over the age of 2. It provides all day education and care between the hours of 8.30 am and 2.30 pm. In 2015 an experienced new head teacher joined a well established teaching team that includes three other qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides a governance and management framework and support personnel to assist the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and embraces the partnership principles inherent in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The kindergarten is committed to including te reo me ōna tikanga Māori in the programme and promotes environmental sustainability. The curriculum is based on children's interests, strengths and needs.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report commented positively on the education programme and the teachers' supportive partnerships with families. In 2013 the staff agreed that they would continue to focus on using internal evaluation to strengthen aspects of the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to benefit from an educational programme that promotes their learning in a supportive emotional and social environment. They are able to make decisions about their play. Children engage in purposeful play, following their interests, and develop their skills and knowledge.</p><p>Teachers respond effectively to what they observe about children. They work alongside children engaging them in conversation, valuing their contributions and asking questions that promote their curiosity and thinking.</p><p>The culture of the kindergarten is very inclusive. Parents feel welcome and are comfortable to stay during all or part of the session. Children with special learning needs are well supported. The cultures and languages of children are acknowledged and special cultural events are celebrated.</p><p>Good progress has been made to provide a bicultural curriculum. Teachers are supported to build their knowledge of te ao Māori and encouraged to use te reo Māori in the programme with children. This is an area the staff want to continue to strengthen.</p><p>The physical environment is well laid out and resourced to support play. Teachers regularly set up equipment and resources to provoke and challenge children. The outdoor area has recently been redesigned and rebuilt. It effectively supports children's play, by providing challenge and access to interesting resources.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn across all areas of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The kindergarten's educational focus on environmental sustainability supports learning in many curriculum areas including science. Teachers skilfully include children's learning in literacy and mathematics in the programme.</p><p>Teachers value whānau as partners in supporting children's learning and encourage parents to share their aspirations for their children with staff. Teachers are strengthening processes that will encourage all parents to share with them the learning that they would like the kindergarten to support.</p><p>Teachers are making good use of technology to improve communication with parents and with each other. Parents value the use of online communication about their children's learning and have increased their contributions to children's assessment. Teachers are also using online discussions to share their thinking and contributions to programme planning and evaluation with each other and with parents.</p><p>The kindergarten is well led by the head teacher and the staff work together as a team with a focus on ongoing improvement. Teachers are supported to improve their professional practice.</p><p>Association systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. Kindergarten operations are guided by a comprehensive strategic plan and a shared vision, linking to the AKA's strategic goals.</p><p>New AKA roles were established to provide more targeted support for head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process is aligned with the AKA and kindergarten strategic plans, monitoring quality and promoting ongoing improvement in kindergartens. AKA support and guidance is responsive to each kindergarten's individual context.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and AKA personnel agree that areas for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>having a greater focus on the impact for children's learning in programme evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by evaluating progress towards strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making parents' aspirations for their children and family cultures more visible in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning and assessment documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Green Bay Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Green Bay Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>15 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
