<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Naenae Playcentre is developing its capacity to improve and sustain positive outcomes for children. The high level of commitment of core members, along with focused support from the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), should enable it to reach this objective.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person, employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association‚Äôs structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs one SPACE(Supporting Parents Alongside Children‚Äôs Education) session for infants and their parents per week, four mixed-age sessions and one for children aged over three and a half. Many children stay at the centre until they reach school age.</p><p>A large proportion of families are new to this service and are learning about playcentre philosophy and operation. A core group of long-serving members takes responsibility for most aspects of management and programme development. Supervisors lead duty teams. An ongoing challenge is promoting interest in adult education and maintaining training levels.</p><p>The centre serves a culturally diverse community. The philosophy emphasises the importance of inclusive practice, working together, and supporting children's learning through play. Providing better support for MƒÅori and Pacific families continues to be a development priority.</p><p>The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</em> Major refurbishment of the building was required to enable this to happen.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children's independence and confidence as learners. There is a wide variety of good quality resources and materials for them to freely access. The outdoor play area supports physically active and creative play. High levels of energy and a sense of fun define the tone of sessions. Children display strong ownership of the playcentre environment which supports their sustained interest in activities.</p><p>The programme is responsive to children's developing ideas and emerging interests. Their voices are heard and they have choices about their participation in adult-led activities. Most are confident communicators who relate well to adults and play cooperatively with their peers.</p><p>A particular strength of the programme is the emphasis on supporting children's creative expression and language. Adults‚Äô enthusiasm for singing and dancing is effectively shared with the children, most of whom choose to join in the energetic group music sessions. Many children are confident to perform in front of others. Language and literacy are valued and well integrated through play. Members are aware of the need to ensure that children have ongoing access to writing tools and a range of meaningful opportunities to become familiar with print.</p><p>Adults are caring and responsive towards children and each other. They provide purposeful support for play and are working on developing consistent ways of managing children‚Äôs behaviour. Care of infants and toddlers is often shared. Now that more very young children are attending sessions, members agree that planning for their learning needs to be given higher priority.</p><p>Members are friendly and welcoming. The language and customs of many cultures are celebrated. There is a strong bicultural focus developing. Commitment to supporting children with special learning needs and their families is evident. Work is being undertaken to strengthen the induction process to maximise support for new families. To further support development of this inclusive approach, members should use the association‚Äôs reflective questions about bicultural practice.</p><p>In 2012, some review and development was undertaken by core members to improve their approach to noticing, recognising and responding to children‚Äôs learning. Professional support was accessed to develop a shared understanding of early learning. Information about children‚Äôs interests is now regularly shared and used for ongoing planning. Members agree that they need to work on embedding the new ideas around learning and also securing the interest and involvement of more parents in adult education and planning the programme.</p><p>A core group of members, highly committed to playcentre philosophy, gives careful consideration to decisions about ongoing operation and the future of the centre. They support each other in various management roles and collaborate in decision making. Those more experienced support the less experienced, to take on responsibilities. Appropriate priorities for development have been collaboratively identified. More systematic organisation of documentation and administrative records needs to be a priority to support emergent leadership and efficient centre operation.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance and aims to promote independence in management at centre level. Self review is valued as part of this process and good frameworks are in place to support members‚Äô practice which is at an early stage in this service.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>While the core group ably manage day-to-day operation they recognise there is an urgent need to interest more people in the education programme, training and taking responsibility for management.</p><p>Other key priorities are agreed as:</p><ul>
<li>developing and implementing a learning programme for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>facilitating shared understanding of, and participation in, assessment, planning and evaluation of the daily programme</li>
<li>identifying key factors, and putting actions in place, that promote the participation and retention of MƒÅori and Pacific families at the centre</li>
<li>more effectively using the association frameworks, reflective questions and guidelines to support consistency and ongoing improvement to practice</li>
<li>developing shared understanding of the self review process to support improved decision making and strategic planning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Naenae Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified an area of non compliance.</p><p>The service is not meeting the Equity Funding reporting requirements.</p><p>In order to address this, the service provider must:</p><ul>
<li>Report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their Equity Funding.</li>
</ul><p>Reporting must include:</p><ul>
<li>an outline of the amount received under each Equity Funding component</li>
<li>a brief description of the purpose to which the funding was applied</li>
<li>a brief outline of the reasons for spending the funding in that way.</li>
</ul><p>The report must be included in the service‚Äôs annual report for presentation at its annual general meeting.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>[Early Childhood Funding Handbook, Chapter 10, Equity Funding]</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In order to improve current practice members should ensure that all association health and safety checklists and actions are completed and signed off as required.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
