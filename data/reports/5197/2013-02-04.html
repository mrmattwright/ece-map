<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Rewi Street Kindergarten is located near the central business district of Te Awamutu. The kindergarten caters for 3 and 4 year old children from the town and surrounding districts. Approximately one third of the children are of M&#257;ori descent. The spacious play areas provide a welcoming and stimulating environment for children and their families. A feature of the site is the large size of the outdoor area, which allows children to engage in active play and exploration.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy states the objective to &lsquo;offer a programme that encourages children to inquire, ask questions, think, take risks, get it wrong and try again&rsquo;. The philosophy also emphasises that &lsquo;children and adults learn together through responsive relationships with people, places and things&rsquo;.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review staffing has remained stable. Teachers have engaged in a range of relevant professional learning with a major focus on children&rsquo;s transition to school. Teachers have also participated in a long-term University of Waikato research project that follows children&rsquo;s progress from kindergarten to their early school years. The kindergarten has responded positively to the recommendations from the 2010 ERO report about strengthening assessment processes and developing children&rsquo;s use of computers for learning.</p><p>The Central North Island Kindergarten Association (CNIKA) provides effective administrational and professional oversight and support for the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between children and teachers are respectful and responsive to children&rsquo;s needs for education and care. Teachers are attuned to children&rsquo;s ideas and encourage them to make decisions about the programme and environment.</p><p>Opportunities for literacy and mathematical learning are well-integrated into play activities. An extensive range of equipment and materials is readily accessible to challenge children&rsquo;s thinking and encourage their exploration. Teachers arrange the environment to allow children to take risks and extend their confidence in physically challenging activities. In addition, there are many activities that allow children to engage in imaginative and creative play.</p><p>Ongoing contact with local schools, professional learning and associated visual displays help children and families to make a smooth transition to primary school.</p><p>The kindergarten programme is based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> (the early childhood curriculum). It allows children to pursue their interests and develop their skills in real-life contexts. Children with special needs are well catered for through individual education plans, support from specialist agencies and assistance from CNIKA. Children benefit from regular trips and learning opportunities in the local community.</p><p>Teachers observe and record children&rsquo;s learning in attractive and informative individual learning portfolios. They are beginning to include contributions from parents and children. Teachers meet regularly to reflect on their work and make improvements that benefit children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>A strong culture of professional learning is evident in the teaching team. Teachers are increasingly encouraged to follow their professional interests to improve the effectiveness of their teaching. Teacher appraisal processes are focused on reflection and strengthening practice. Spontaneous reviews of many important aspects of the kindergarten are having a positive effect on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The teaching team and ERO agree that the kindergarten&rsquo;s next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop systems for strategic and annual planning, and self review</li>
<li>ensure goals in teacher appraisal includes clear links to professional learning and the annual plan</li>
<li>review and further develop the inclusion of bicultural perspectives throughout the kindergarten</li>
<li>explore ways to more fully involve parents and children in assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>explore teaching strategies that more consistently extend children&rsquo;s problem solving skills.</li>
</ul><p>Attention to the above aspects of kindergarten operations is likely to further promote positive outcomes for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rewi Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
