</table><p>Ra-itu Koanga Reo is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Significant staffing issues at Ra-Itu Koanga Reo have contributed to poor quality provision for children. Substantial improvements are required in a number of areas, including staffing, the curriculum, management systems, and health and safety.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ra-itu Koanga Reo is an early childhood centre connected to the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Tokoroa, South Waikato. It is governed by a management committee, which includes church and parent representatives as well as centre staff.</p><p>The koanga is licensed for 27 children, including up to ten infants and toddlers, who share the learning space with older children. Most of the children enrolled are Cook Islands MƒÅori. The koanga's philosophy is based on Cook Islands MƒÅori culture and language, and Christian values.</p><p>The service provides meals several times a week, with a strong focus on healthy eating. Children also bring lunches from home.</p><p>There has been a significant number of staff changes since the 2015 ERO review. The centre manager is a qualified teacher who was appointed in 2016. She divides her time between operational duties and working with children. A long-serving teacher is the only other permanent member of staff. The service currently employs four untrained relievers as it seeks to appoint permanent, qualified teachers and an administrator.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2015 report identified areas for improvement, including teacher practice, strategic planning, management systems and communication processes. Insufficient progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Recruitment of staff is an ongoing issue for management. Lack of staff poses challenges to ensuring that there is adequate supervision of children. It also has a negative impact on the quality of care and education provided. Leaders agree that addressing this is a matter of urgency. The appointment of motivated, committed staff will support consistency in meeting the requirements of the <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008</em>.</p><p>Children at the service benefit from affectionate, familiar relationships with staff who know them well. Teachers' brief interactions with children are positive. They should consider how to balance their time between routine tasks and sustained, high-quality teaching interactions. Professional learning is needed, to build a range of intentional teaching strategies that encourage children's focus and challenge their thinking.</p><p>The koanga's philosophy is not strongly evident in practice. Opportunities for children to be immersed in Cook Island language and culture are mostly restricted to group times. Engaging role plays and stories related to Christian values, are sometimes evident. Teachers should find ways to integrate the key elements of the koanga philosophy throughout the daily programme.</p><p>To enact the philosophy to a greater extent, teachers should engage with professional learning related to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum. This would help them to identify the learning outcomes that are highly valued in the Ra-itu Koanga Reo community. Teachers should use current research to establish agreed, documented teaching practices that promote these outcomes. These must be consistently enacted in practice and shown throughout documentation. To improve teaching practice, particular attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the unique learning styles of infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting independence, social skills and challenge within a mixed-age setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>purposeful use of the learning environment and resources to engage children in learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to grow practices that recognise te Tiriti o Waitangi and the place of tangata whenua in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers regularly document observations of children's play. These stories contain some useful information for families about early learning. However, a cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation is not in place. A purposeful process, focused on promoting children's learning through targeted teacher strategies, must be established.</p><p>Further work is needed in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing teachers' understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing effective administrative, governance and management systems.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The management committee is committed to the koanga's special character. Many members are long-serving. They agree that it is time to significantly increase resourcing and active support for the service. As this develops, the progress of strategic goals should be documented. Priority should be placed on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>addressing health and safety concerns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adequately staffing the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing professional development for leaders and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refreshing resources and the learning environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ra-itu Koanga Reo completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>health and safety requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adequate, consistently maintained supervision by qualified staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a curriculum that is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation and that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal that meets the requirements of the Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the display of appropriate information for parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning policies with current legal requirements, particularly the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, HS12,31, GMA1,7,7A; Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, Schedule 2; Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Ra-itu Koanga Reo. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ra-itu Koanga Reo will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>18 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
