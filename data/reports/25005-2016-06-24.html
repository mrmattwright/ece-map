</table><p>The Pukapuka Preschool's 2013 ERO report noted the need for significant improvements. Although some progress has been made in improving the programme and learning environment for children, governance and management matters have yet to be fully addressed. External advisory support would help the manager and trustees to make the required improvements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukapuka Preschool is a well established, total immersion centre in Mangere. The centre's aim is to promote the Pukapuka language, culture and traditions, along with Christian beliefs. Staff are of Pukapuka heritage and are fluent speakers of the language, as well as being qualified early childhood teachers. The centre is governed and managed by the Wale Taute Charitable Trust, which leads several other initiatives to progress the interests of the Auckland Pukapuka community.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 30 children over the age of two years.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report, the centre has had some major changes. A new manager has been appointed and has improved management and administrative systems. The centre has received funding to support future expansion to an increased roll of 70 children, including children under two years of age.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted improvements in the programme, staff involvement in professional learning and an environment that supported children's learning and engagement in the programme. These positive aspects are still evident.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report also suggested that teachers provide more challenging and meaningful learning experiences for children and extend their fluency in Pukapuka language. The report recommended that self review and management planning should be improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre supervisor and teachers have made some improvements to the centre‚Äôs learning programme and management systems. However, these changes are not well enough established to sustain the continuous improvements in the quality of education and care.</p><p>Teachers have established a strong foundation for further development. Warm relationships and interactions underpin the programme and contribute to centre‚Äôs welcoming tone. Children are happy and settle quickly when they arrive. Connections among children and families are strong. Children are confident, play cooperatively and are independent. They make choices about their play and participate in sustained play for long periods, either independently or with teachers.</p><p>The curriculum is flexible and is culturally appropriate. It is embedded in Pukapuka language, values and beliefs, which are skilfully modelled by teachers. Children confidently respond to teachers in Pukapuka language. Teachers also successfully promote the use of te reo, waiata and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>The supervisor and teachers work well together and plan collaboratively. Good systems are now in place to support teachers to improve self review and enhance their professional practice. Teachers could now consider using current early childhood research to reflect on and guide their practice, and challenge their thinking. They could meet more regularly to develop curriculum planning that promotes a more complex, child-initiated programme, and assessment practices that identify learning opportunities.</p><p>Parents who spoke to ERO appreciate the support teachers give them and their children. Teachers‚Äô knowledge of children‚Äôs diverse cultures, backgrounds and language contributes to children settling well. Families and teachers share information about children's learning in the centre and at home in a variety of appropriate ways.</p><p>Through regular contact with members of the Pukapuka community who visit the complex, children continue to be surrounded by Pukapuka language and culture.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers agree that to improve outcomes for children, teachers will need support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve their understanding of current early childhood education theories and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a systematic approach to assessing children‚Äôs progress, planning and learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan and implement a more deliberate programme for children about physical activity and food nutrition.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre leaders recognise that they and the trustees must act with urgency to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement robust appraisal processes for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the centre‚Äôs strategic plan to reflect the philosophy, and work with teachers and parents to develop an annual action plan and formally document key actions to meet the centre‚Äôs goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review policies and procedures so that they are aligned to current legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukapuka Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the centre manager must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that required human resource management practices are implemented, including teacher appraisal that aligns with the <em>Practicing Teacher Criteria</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that parent permission slips for excursions show minimum adult-to-child ratios and that risk analysis and management procedures are implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>undertake regular police vetting of all non-registered staff who have contact with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>report to the preschool community about the expenditure of Equity Funding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish curriculum practices that demonstrate a knowledge of relevant theories and practices in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish strategic planning and specific annual action plans to guide the service‚Äôs operations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2,4, HS17, GMA7, 8, Early Childhood Funding Handbook, Ch10.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukapuka Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
