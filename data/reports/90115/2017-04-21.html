</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori @ Arrowtown is part of the BestStart organisation. BestStart provides support for the centre through a professional services manager (PSM) and a business manager. The service provides separate areas for children to play and learn. One is for older children, the other for infants and toddlers. The multiple spaces in each area provide a varied and home-like environment.</p><p>After years of stable staffing, the centre is working positively through a time of change with a new centre manager and several new teachers.</p><p>Children from a variety of cultural backgrounds attend the centre.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have made improvements and responded well to the recommendations from the 2013 ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a broad curriculum. There is a strong focus on using the local environment and parents' expertise to enrich children's learning. Children are able to choose from a wide range of activities. They are able to work independently and access resources easily. They know where equipment is and are familiar with the daily routines and expectations. These features help them to have a strong sense of belonging. Children are allowed to make choices and follow their own interests. The service is well resourced to support the Montessori philosophy.</p><p>Children benefit from caring, trusting relationships with their teachers. There are sensitive, responsive, positive interactions between teachers, children and parents. Children play and learn in a calm, unhurried and settled environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Teachers are thoughtfully inclusive of children with particular needs to ensure they can access the curriculum alongside their friends. They respond well to individual children's culture, language and identity. All children have good opportunities to grow their understanding and awareness of New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Children's cultures and backgrounds are valued by the centre in visible and practical ways.</p><p>Teachers' planning and assessment practices have improved since the last ERO review although this continues to be an area to strengthen. Learning stories show how teachers build on children's interests and in some cases plan to build complexity into children's learning. Through a recent review of the transition programme, teachers are now supporting children to move into, through and beyond the centre with greater confidence.</p><p>The service has a new manager and several new teachers. Through a strong induction and mentoring programme the manager is carefully building a team of teachers whose practices reflect the Montessori philosophy. She has also introduced a new system to more efficiently enable regular communication between teachers and parents. The PSM and centre manager provide professional learning and development opportunities for teachers to grow their practice. The appraisal process links well to culturally responsive practices as well as Education Council requirements and the goals of this service.</p><p>The centre manager is well poised to strengthen her role as the professional leader together with the head teacher of the under 3's rooms. Together they are taking a measured approach to gathering the views and opinions of all staff involved before making changes and documenting expected teaching practice.</p><p>The governance responsibilities are very well managed by BestStart support managers. This gives the centre manager freedom to be the professional leader within the centre. BestStart health and safety systems support strong processes and practices within this centre. The organisation suitably provides resources for ongoing development of the physical spaces and refurbishments.</p><p>There have been some positive changes as a result of internal evaluation. The PSM and centre leaders agree that the team still needs to build a shared understanding of how this could be more evident in the way leaders and teachers show the difference they are making to children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers need further support to develop intentional teaching strategies to support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers need to strengthen planning and assessment, making it clearer what difference they are making and what they plan to do to support children's next learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching-as-inquiry practices need to be further developed to contribute more meaningfully to planning, assessment, evaluation and appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers need to develop a shared understanding of and implement rigorous evaluation to support ongoing improvements.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori @ Arrowtown completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori @ Arrowtown will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>21 April 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.&nbsp;</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service&nbsp;</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></p><h4>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><div>
