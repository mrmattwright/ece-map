</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rising Stars, Lynfield, is one of two privately owned early childhood education centres in West Auckland. It is licensed to provide care and education for 54 children, including 12 under two years of age.</p><p>The centre is housed in a refurbished building that has undergone some improvements since the last ERO review in 2013. There are three main learning areas. One is for young infants and toddlers, one for the older toddlers and one for the pre-school children. The areas all connect to a large outdoor play area which has been recently extended. Older children are able to become involved in gardening, growing plants and practicing aspects of environmental sustainability.</p><p>Rising Stars has a philosophy which is inclusive and welcoming for children and their families. The centre vision focuses on developing children‚Äôs learning through their individual strengths and interests. Centre leaders have made some progress with recommendations from the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers make provision for children to have good levels of variety and choice in the centre‚Äôs programmes. They affirm and promote children‚Äôs learning through play. Teachers take the time to explain to parents and whƒÅnau how, and what children are learning through their play.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children‚Äôs interests are linked together by teachers to form focus topics such as ‚ÄòChildren of Tangaroa‚Äô or ‚ÄòPapatuanuku in the Garden‚Äô. Teachers build individual learning goals for each child into these topics. Children‚Äôs portfolios contain learning stories which outline the activities, events and some of the specific learning that has occurred within the context of a child‚Äôs play.</p><p>Children freely access the materials and resources they need for learning. They engage in sustained play and frequently work cooperatively and collaboratively on shared activities and projects. Children use the outside play areas where there are some good physical challenges for them on the outdoor equipment. Children also enjoy frequent excursions out into the community to stimulate their curiosity and cater for their different learning interests.</p><p>Parent 'voice' is actively sought by teachers. This enables parents to contribute some of their ideas to the planning of the centre‚Äôs learning programmes. Family members report high levels of satisfaction with the centre. Relationships between centre staff and parents are very positive.</p><p>There are good transition practices for children when they enter the centre and when they leave to enrol in local primary schools. Teachers wisely consider children‚Äôs developmental readiness when they move and transition them between the centre rooms.</p><p>Children have very positive relationships with their teachers. Staff are responsive to children‚Äôs needs. Children under the age of two years are nurtured and cared for well. Their environment is comfortable and relaxed.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs current strategic plan has specific goals that prioritise good educational outcomes for children. Building teacher capability is a key part of the centre‚Äôs strategic plan. Leaders have identified the need to keep staff up to date with new ideas in early childhood educational theory to improve their effectiveness in responding to children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>Self review of centre programmes, systems and operations is working well at a functional level to bring about changes. The self-review process could now be improved with a more evaluative approach. This would help teachers to better gauge the effectiveness of strategies, programmes and initiatives and to evaluate how well the centre‚Äôs philosophy and values are being enacted.</p><p>The owner of the centre is actively involved in many aspects of centre organisation and this is appreciated by staff. He acknowledges that support for the centre manager in her professional role is an important next step. Development of leadership across the team is appropriately included as one of the goals in the centre‚Äôs strategic plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agreed that the centre‚Äôs next steps to improve educational outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>align systems and operations to the goals in the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>upgrade and update the centre‚Äôs teacher registration and appraisal processes so that they are consistent with current legislative requirements</li>
<li>review centre policies using relevant external guidance and advice</li>
<li>identify the centre‚Äôs bicultural obligations and plan how to embed them further in policies and programmes</li>
<li>continue to expand the opportunities in centre programmes for children to engage in complex play that develops their critical and creative thinking</li>
<li>place children‚Äôs learning dispositions and skills at the forefront of programme planning and learning stories.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rising Stars Lynfield Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rising Stars Lynfield Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
