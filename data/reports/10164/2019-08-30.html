</table><p>Rising Stars Lynfield Early Childhood Centre¬†<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rising Stars Lynfield Early Childhood Centre in West Auckland is licensed for 54 children, including up to 12 children under two years of age. Children are grouped into three main learning areas according to their age and stages of development. All three groups have access to an outdoor area, the two older groups spending much of the day together.</p><p>While about half of the children enrolled are Indian, there are many cultures within the centre. The staff are also multicultural and have a good knowledge of the children's cultures and languages.</p><p>The centre is one of two centres owned by the same company. The managers of the two centres provide professional support and guidance for each other with some common policies and procedures.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is closely aligned with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It recognises the importance of positive, supportive relationships and an environment that supports children to lead their own learning.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report commented positively on the care and education that children receive, and the positive relationships between staff and children, and staff and parents. It identified some next steps related to management and the bicultural aspects of the programme. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the centre are very settled and seem happy. They are well cared for and have many opportunities to learn in a respectful environment. They experience positive interactions with teachers that support their wellbeing and learning.</p><p>The teachers know the children and their families well. They are exploring a new approach where a key teacher is assigned to a small group of children. This approach promotes greater engagement with parents with a focus on children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Learning environments support children‚Äôs learning. They are well resourced and well organised, so children can access appropriate resources. Teachers could now consider how they can reduce the impact of centre routines such as packing up before meals, on children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Tikanga and te reo MƒÅori are well integrated into the programme and there is a commitment to strengthen these aspects of the centre's curriculum. Aspects of Pacific cultures are also included in the programme.</p><p>Teachers are familiar with many aspects of the children's cultures, including their home languages. This enables them to communicate with the children and families that speak languages other than English at home. The learning environment and aspects of the programme reflect the children's cultures.</p><p>The centre caters effectively for diverse groups of learners. Children under the age of two are well cared for. Teachers access support for children with additional learning needs. They have developed strategies for supporting children from homes where English is an additional language.</p><p>Assessment of children‚Äôs learning and programme planning are being strengthened. Centre managers are developing guidelines to encourage teachers to reflect on children‚Äôs learning over time and to identify how they are supporting children's learning. The guidelines will also indicate how teachers can best respond to parents‚Äô aspirations for their children.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. An up-to-date policy framework guides centre operations. The strategic plan, developed from reflection and self review, communicates the areas identified for improvement. The teacher appraisal system has been updated to meet the requirements of the Teaching Council. Teachers have access to good quality and relevant professional learning and development.</p><p>The centre manager could now strengthen both internal evaluation and teachers‚Äô inquiry into their practice by ensuring that these processes are guided by clearly stated evaluative questions. Strategic planning and teachers' development plans would be strengthened by ensuring that goals in both are explicit.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment processes to better inform programme planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation to inform strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to explore ways to build partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau that contribute to children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rising Stars Lynfield Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>30 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
