</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Botanical Road Free Kindergarten provides both school-day and sessional education for children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review 47 children were enrolled, and five identify as being of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of children‚Äôs interests and family aspirations, along with a commitment to the <em>Enviroschools</em> and <em>Healthy Heart</em> programmes. In addition, whakaute, respect for people, places and things, including the natural environment are pivotal to the kaupapa of the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a Resource Teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with emphasis nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities, education for sustainability, meeting community needs, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There is a good range of self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of education and care provided by its kindergartens.</p><p>Consistent with TRK policy of only employing trained and registered teachers in regulated positions the kindergarten is staffed by four qualified and registered teachers along with an administrator. Support for children with identified special educational needs, above that provided by the Ministry of Education is available from the TRK.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teaching team has a clearly documented, shared and well-implemented vision and philosophy. Dispositions of whakaute (respect), whanaungatanga (relationships), arahina (leadership) and kawenga (responsibility) provide an effective framework for kindergarten practices and culture to positively influence learning outcomes for children and families. Highly effective self review is focused on strengthening teachers‚Äô practice, children‚Äôs learning and strategic kindergarten development. A key feature of self review is the collaborative nature of reviews that are underpinned by research and current educational theory.</p><p>The kindergarten community benefits from the highly effective, visionary educational leadership that is provided by the head teacher. An unrelenting focus on improvement is demonstrated by the teaching team. Shared leadership is resulting in teachers‚Äô skills, knowledge and experiences being maximised to enrich the curriculum for children, build individual teacher capability and the leadership capacity within the kindergarten. In addition, the senior teacher team makes a significant contribution to growing teachers‚Äô capability. Responsive mentoring and constructive professional challenge are pivotal to their motivation and ongoing professional learning and development.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum is strongly reflective of both <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and <em>Te Whatu Pokeka</em>, Bicultural Assessment, Planning and Evaluation for Early Childhood Education. The inclusion of teaching practices and interactions that grow children‚Äôs social competence and problem solving, <em>Enviroschools</em> and the <em>Healthy Heart</em> programme are contributing to their knowledge, skills and view of themselves as capable and confident learners. In addition, children have many opportunities to be involved in, and develop relationships within, the local and wider communities. Parents who spoke with ERO appreciate the high-quality learning opportunities experienced by their children. Teachers welcome and actively encourage parents to be involved as active partners in the learning process.</p><p>The inclusion of <em>MƒÅtauranga MƒÅori</em> enables all children to experience the MƒÅori language and culture. This is achieved through including MƒÅori knowledge in relation to the natural, physical and spiritual worlds. MƒÅori children can see that their language and culture is important and valued.</p><p>Children‚Äôs individual puka puka (assessment records) show continuity of their learning, contributed to by regular goal setting that includes their parent‚Äôs ideas and aspirations. These records are highly valued by children and families. Children confidently share their learning, enjoy revisiting previous experiences and making comparisons in their own interests, growth and development. Practices and processes for assessment, planning and evaluation are well established. Teachers agree there would be benefit in strengthening culturally responsive assessment practice to more deliberately capture children‚Äôs own cultures and build on learnings from home.</p><p>Children enjoy positive and reciprocal interactions and relationships with their teachers. ERO observed many examples of effective teaching, these include:</p><ul>
<li>designing and implementing a curriculum that empowers children to be confident and capable to make decisions about their learning and make contribution to the programme</li>
<li>supporting children to develop complex social and communication skills for a range of purposes</li>
<li>the meaningful and skilful integration of literacy, mathematics, science and technology based on children‚Äôs interests, strengths and exploration</li>
<li>fostering children‚Äôs development through planned and spontaneous opportunities for them to develop and demonstrate leadership (arahina).</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team has a current focus on being more attuned with children to bring their passions and interest to life in the emergent curriculum. ERO affirms this direction and the potential this action research has to deepen teachers‚Äô responses and children‚Äôs role as partners in planning for their own learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Botanical Road Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Botanical Road Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
