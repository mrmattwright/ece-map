</table><p>Tokoroa Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tokora Playcentre is a parent-led education and care service located in Tokoroa. It caters for children from birth to school age and operates two mixed-age sessions per week. The playcentre is licensed for 30 children including 15 under the age of two years. The current roll of 20 children includes six who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>During 2018, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation transitioned from operating with 32 regional associations to become one national body with six regional offices. In the central north island, six associations have merged into a regional hub renamed 'Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region' that now includes 95 playcentres over a large geographic area. At Tokoroa Playcentre the president is supported by a committee of parent members. A centre administrator and centre support worker are provided by the federation to assist with session operation.</p><p>Through their national philosophy, the playcentre places emphasis on whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi - families growing together. They empower adults and children to play, work and grow together and value and affirm parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2016, some progress has been made in strengthening positive guidance strategies and facilitating transitions into the playcentre. Members accessed support from the Ministry of Education to strengthen these processes. There remain some significant areas still to be addressed relating to assessment of learning, curriculum knowledge and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents identify children‚Äôs emergent interests which are used effectively to inform planning. Wider family and whƒÅnau contributions to programme planning are encouraged. Photographic examples of the child‚Äôs engagement in the life of the centre are recorded by parents in their child‚Äôs portfolio. Strengthening parents' knowledge and documentation of assessment continues to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Strong, responsive and respectful relationships have been established. Transitions into playcentre are well supported. Independence and self-management are actively encouraged through flexible and responsive routines. Members recognise and value the importance of children learning through play. A large outdoor environment provides opportunities for children to explore, take risks and develop their physical skills. Children up to the age of two are supported within a mixed-aged family like environment. Further incorporating the use of te ao MƒÅori with the centres programme is likely to support MƒÅori children's sense of language, culture and identity. Children are empowered to make choices about their learning. Peer learning and reciprocal relationships are encouraged. Children develop a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Leadership within the playcentre is collaborative. Leaders encourage and invite parents and whƒÅnau to take an active role in their children‚Äôs learning. They have established a useful strategic plan to guide ongoing centre improvements. Roles and responsibilities are shared amongst members, who recognise that there is an urgent need to fill key positions. Members are actively encouraged to undertake training to support capability and meet licencing requirements. Leaders actively contribute to the smooth running of the centre.</p><p>The Playcentre Federation provides good quality governance. Parent education programmes have a focus on building knowledge and understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development. There is a strong focus on MƒÅori as priority learners in the federation strategic plan, and in the centre plan. Supportive communication between the federation and regions throughout the restructure has supported ongoing playcentre operations. Current policies and systems are in place until new federation systems are implemented nationally. The playcentre philosophy, vision and documented strategic goals have been set. There is now the need to measure the impact of actions taken on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for Tokoroa Playcentre, with support from regional management, is to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>leaders' knowledge and understanding about self review and their capability to undertake review focused on improving outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and develop a shared understanding of roles and responsibilities with in the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning, including members' knowledge of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island regional leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement strategic and annual regional plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor and strengthen each playcentre‚Äôs understanding of internal evaluation to inform ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support individual playcentre personnel to robustly report on the progress towards their appropriate strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal processes to support centre support and enable administrators to grow their practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tokoroa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>8 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>
