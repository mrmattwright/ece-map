</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Insoll Kindergarten, located in Enderley Hamilton, is licensed for 40 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children from two years old to school age. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is an additional language. At the time of this ERO review, 40 children were enrolled, including 13 who identify as MƒÅori and seven from Pacific nations.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòOur children are strong in heart, head and hand‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumƒÅtua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the WKA are involved in a ‚ÄòCool for School‚Äô transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato Under 5 Energise. The kindergartens‚Äô education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy states that it provides a vibrant, welcoming and inclusive environment. Tikanga MƒÅori and the celebration of diversity are integral to the programme. Teachers, parents and whƒÅnau work in partnership to develop children‚Äôs self-esteem, knowledge and skills to become independent life-long learners.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014, the kindergarten has been relicensed to reflect the increase in operational hours. The teaching team remains stable. The kindergarten has responded well to the key area for development identified in the previous report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm and caring relationships between children and teachers provide a strong foundation for learning. Teachers skilfully develop children's social competence through high expectations and a focus on the development of empathy. They genuinely listen to and respond to children in ways that facilitate their play and learning. Teachers use effective learning conversations to support oral language development, particularly for children for whom English is not their first language. Secure and trusting relationships encourage children to manage risk taking.</p><p>The curriculum effectively promotes positive outcomes for children. They are encouraged to lead their own learning. The large natural outdoor area provides children with many opportunities to learn about sustainable practices and how to care for the living world. MƒÅori children‚Äôs sense of belonging is enhanced through the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, waiata and karakia. The teaching of local iwi history would further enhance children's sense of belonging and identity. Children with additional needs are well supported by teachers who are proactive in seeking support from relevant external agencies. Samoan children's language, culture and identity is acknowledged and celebrated in assessment practices and the kindergarten's resources. Transitions into and out of the kindergarten are managed well. Literacy, mathematics, science, music and creative expression are well integrated into the programme. There is an appropriate balance between child-led play and group experiences to broaden learning and challenge thinking. All children benefit from an inclusive and rich curriculum.</p><p>Teachers effectively respond to parent aspirations. Partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau are based on mutual respect. Teachers use this knowledge to plan for children‚Äôs diverse strengths, needs and interests. A range of effective strategies supports parent and whƒÅnau engagement in the life of the centre. These include individual portfolios both online and in hard copy, visual 'learning leaves' that share images of children engaged in play, and teacher summaries.</p><p>Leaders effectively promote and enact the kindergarten's philosophy and they strongly advocate for children and their families. Together they have nurtured a harmonious and collaborative team culture, where the strengths of the individual teachers are well utilised. A useful framework for internal evaluation has been developed and is aligned to the kindergarten‚Äôs priorities.</p><p>Education services managers (ESMs) work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operations. The WKA has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to high-quality, inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for leaders and teachers is to further develop their understanding about the expectations of the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation with a focus on deepening and increasing the complexity of children‚Äôs learning across the breadth of the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy with the current community in order to identify priorities for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a localised curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Insoll Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Insoll Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>6 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
