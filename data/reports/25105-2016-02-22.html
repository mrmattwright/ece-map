</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riverhills Early Learning Centre is licensed for 25 children including 2 children aged under two years. The centre provides full day programmes in an adapted residential property in Pakuranga. The centre‚Äôs roll reflects its multicultural community. The children attending the centre are predominately PƒÅkehƒÅ, MƒÅori, Indian and Chinese.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy promotes a tuƒÅkana- tƒìina approach where younger and older children can learn from each other. Children have, in mixed age groups, opportunities to interact and play together for periods of time in both the indoor and outdoor areas. There is also an emphasis placed on building respectful relationships and partnerships with families and whƒÅnau. The teaching team has a strong commitment to the all-round wellbeing, care and development of children.</p><p>A team of three qualified teachers and one teacher currently in training are led by the centre supervisor. Teachers make good links in programme planning to <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> Children benefit from the centre‚Äôs good teacher to child ratio.</p><p>The centre currently has plans and resource consent to extend and enlarge the centre. This will allow the owner to increase the roll and reconfigure and modernise the premises in ways that benefit children. It will also be an opportunity to make some necessary improvements to work facilities for staff.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report commented on the positive relationships and good communication between teachers, children and families. It also recommended further development of programme planning, self-review, management planning, and staff appraisal. The owner and the teaching team are continuing to address these recommendations. External professional development has resulted in improvements in self review and appraisal. However, there are still some areas to be fully addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Inclusive and respectful relationships are evident between children, parents and staff. Teachers have good opportunities to engage with whƒÅnau daily and build partnerships with parents. Some staff speak languages other than English, which can help children to settle and feel a sense of belonging.</p><p>Children have opportunities to make choices about their play and enjoy playing and socialising together. They make friends and are at ease with each other and with adults.</p><p>Teachers are attentive and responsive to the immediate needs and preferences of children up to two years of age. Infants make choices and are encouraged to join in activities. They benefit from respectful, nurturing care from teachers and opportunities to interact with older children.</p><p>Parents speak highly of the centre‚Äôs ethos of care. A strong sense of parent support and appreciation of the centre is evident. Many staff have been with the centre for a number of years and have a deep understanding of the needs and aspirations of the local community.</p><p>Pre-entry visits are arranged to meet the individual needs of the children. As children approach school age, fortnightly transition visits are made to a local primary school.</p><p>Teachers work well together. They plan the topics and themes of the programme together and effectively promote children‚Äôs self-management skills. Teachers communicate well with each other and respond quickly to children. They are very respectful of children, they listen and provide time for children to respond and think.</p><p>Some teachers are using skilful questioning to very effectively extend children‚Äôs language development and thinking. Teachers provide a number of indoor and outdoor activity options for children including activities that promote early literacy and maths concepts.</p><p>Teachers should now consider ways to present and use equipment to better motivate and maximise children‚Äôs interest and continue to extend the complexity of children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Bicultural practices continue to develop. Professional learning opportunities and visits to the local mƒÅrae are building teachers‚Äô understanding of and commitment to deepening their knowledge of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Cultural diversity is valued and different cultural aspects are included in centre planning. Parents appreciate and value the use of te reo MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified future goals that include strengthening procedures for documenting planning and assessment. New web-based portfolios have recently been introduced to better share children‚Äôs learning with whƒÅnau. This should enable teachers to record more individual learning stories that show each child‚Äôs progress, interests and growth. It would be worthwhile to review the storage and access that children have to their learning stories. Consideration should be given to making it easier for children to share, discuss and revisit their learning.</p><p>Strategic priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>undertake a stocktake, and review the use of resources and play equipment available to children</li>
<li>plan how teachers can make better use of equipment and resources to motivate, engage and challenge children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>further develop learning stories so that they more clearly show children‚Äôs individual interests and progress over time.</li>
</ul><p>Self review is valued by the team. Following professional development, considerable progress has been made to improve centre self review. A well-documented review of science has recently been completed. A number of policies and procedures have also been reviewed using staff and whƒÅnau feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning and evaluation processes to promote children‚Äôs thinking and complex play</li>
<li>providing leadership professional development opportunities for the centre supervisor</li>
<li>refining the centre‚Äôs strategic planning documents to prioritise children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverhills Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, service managers should:</p><ul>
<li>review the centre‚Äôs procedures for record keeping with staff to ensure nappy changes, medication and accidents are accurately and consistently recorded</li>
<li>ensure cleaning practices are monitored across all areas of the centre</li>
<li>review procedures to ensure potential hazards outdoors are identified and improvements are promptly actioned.</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
