</table><p>Brynley Street Nursery and Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Brynley Street Nursery and Preschool is a small privately owned service. The centre's owners are involved in the ownership of four other centres in the Prebbleton area.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is underpinned by the Treaty of Waitangi and Te WhƒÅriki, with a focus on relationships, whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, the use of natural resources and the environment.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 35 children, with a maximum of 10 children aged under two years. It has separate nursery and preschool areas, each with its own outdoor spaces. The mixed aged group setting for two to five year olds allows older and younger children to support each other within the programme. Staffing at the service is stable and experienced. Most of the staff are fully qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre has made good progress regarding the following next steps identified in the 2016 ERO report:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening aspects of the self-review process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>successfully embedding the new appraisal processes and further developing aspects of performance management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing bicultural perspectives in centre documentation and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are viewed as confident, capable learners. The programme is child-initiated, where children can follow their interests for extended periods of uninterrupted time. Children can choose from a wide range of experiences in a well-resourced programme. Teachers focus appropriately on the individual needs of each child. They respond well to their interests and strengths, and effectively identify how they can support them through the programme. There is a strong focus on developing close learning partnerships with parents.</p><p>Children under two years benefit from responsive teachers and respectful, unhurried routines. Transitions into, within and out of the service are well managed and focus on the needs and wellbeing of each child and family. Leaders and teachers have established positive relationships with the local primary schools to better facilitate transitions.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs benefit from an inclusive environment. Teachers have positive connections with community agencies. This ensures children and their whƒÅnau are very well supported.</p><p>Manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are well-established centre values. Teachers incorporate te ao MƒÅori values into the daily programme. They work together collaboratively and foster respectful reciprocal relationships with each other and with children.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed clear strategic and annual planning to guide the development and operation of the service. They focus on ensuring accountability, with regular informative reporting in place, and provide useful formats that assist in the effective monitoring of systems and processes. Teachers make good use of the internal evaluation process. This could be further strengthened by ensuring that each internal evaluation is revisited.</p><p>Leaders and teachers engage in an effective appraisal processes and targeted professional learning and development. Leadership is collaborative, and teachers support each other to achieve the centre's priorities.</p><p>Teachers' assessment and planning is high quality. Learning stories show increasing complexity in children's learning and include ways that intentional teaching strategies have been used to support this. Teachers actively seek parents' aspirations for their child and respond to these. They regularly evaluate children's progress and the effectiveness of the planning and teaching strategies. Further strengthening of assessment would be improved by reflecting children's language, culture and identity in documentation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the service's key next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural practices, and understandings and use of te ao MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the final stage of the internal evaluation process to determine the impact of the inquiry on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the visibility of children's home language, culture and identity in assessment documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Brynley Street Nursery and Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>11 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
