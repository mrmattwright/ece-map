</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wharerangi Kindergarten provides early childhood care and education for up to 41 children aged over two years. The service is located in the Napier suburb of Tamatea and of the current roll of 40 children, two identify as MƒÅori. Morning sessions cater for the younger children. Older children attend six-hour sessions. Since 2012, there has been a considerable increase in the number of younger children attending.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operations of 16 kindergartens, including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees govern the association with support of the general manager. Two education managers have responsibility for building teacher capability. The head teacher models a distributive leadership approach. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa MƒÅtauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. He demonstrates a clear vision for MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Positive relationships between parents, whƒÅnau, community and staff are evident. Since the September 2012 ERO report, learning partnerships have been further enhanced. There has also been progress in teachers' use of self review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in a curriculum that reflects the kindergarten philosophy. Learning experiences foster creativity, calmness, caring and excitement. Respectful teaching practices contribute to children confidently taking risks and persevering in play. Well-developed relationships with families and children contribute to the strong sense of belonging evident.</p><p>Children's interests and engagement informs the programme. Opportunities for them to lead and self-direct their own learning are enacted.</p><p>MƒÅori children have opportunities to succeed as MƒÅori. Strengthened relationships with whƒÅnau have provided opportunities for their expertise and guidance to enrich teachers' practices and knowledge. All children are increasingly experiencing a curriculum that weaves MƒÅori ways of knowing, doing and being through daily practices. Te ao MƒÅori is genuinely expressed through children's learning narratives. Teachers plan to continue the development in this key area through professional learning programmes.</p><p>Children with complex learning needs engage in a programme and an environment that affirms them as individuals. Teachers prepare, plan and respond to learning in ways that are meaningful and purposeful for each child.</p><p>Learning partnerships between parents and whƒÅnau have strengthened. Shared aspirations for children link home to the centre and inform teaching and learning. Individual children's strengths are highlighted and specific areas to grow and extend are identified. Teachers are currently reviewing planning to see how well deliberate teaching is deepening learning for children. Continuing this review should further strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>A planned approach to internal evaluation has enriched teachers' understanding and appreciation of how it contributes to improved outcomes for children. Planned and spontaneous reviews are occurring. The centre is well placed to extend self review to better evaluate the impact of kindergarten initiatives.</p><p>Strong collaborative teamwork and shared leadership is well modelled by the head teacher. Staff are open and critically reflective. The teaching team contribute their knowledge to their colleagues in the wider association. Teacher appraisal and professional learning processes continue to develop and support growth in teaching practices. Professional development is specifically targeted to children's and teachers' needs and interests with support and guidance from centre staff and education managers.</p><p>The association empowers teachers to use the team's strengths to respond to children and the parent community. Education managers continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes to effectively build teacher capability. These include assessment, planning, self-review and internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue with the current review of planning to support ongoing improvements in assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop self review and internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wharerangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wharerangi Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
