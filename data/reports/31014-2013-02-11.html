<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Te Kuiti Playcentre is very well placed to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Kuiti Playcentre is a parent led early childhood centre that operates under the umbrella of King Country Playcentre Association. It is licensed for a maximum of 30 children at any one time, and caters for families from Te Kuiti and surrounding farming areas. The centre provides five sessions a week, with two 'Big Kids' sessions for three to five year olds. It is supervised by a fully qualified and experienced early childhood teacher, supported by an experienced playcentre parent member. Te Kuiti Playcentre has many links with the community, and families currently participating in the life of the playcentre have intergenerational connections with the service.</p><p>Parents have developed a shared vision that reflects national and local association philosophy. They support the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and are committed to biculturalism. Parents strongly value child-initiated play, and emphasise the role of parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>The centre strongly promotes playcentre adult education, and members have also participated in external professional development that continues to increase their knowledge of assessment, planning and evaluation. In February 2010, ERO reported positively about the quality of the learning programme.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in ten early childhood education services within the King Country Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children are welcomed into a high quality learning environment, where they are free to play, explore and learn. Through parent members‚Äô extensive networks in the wider community, children also enjoy rich and meaningful experiences in places of local interest and importance. The playcentre‚Äôs reciprocal relationships with local businesses, the school, marae and kohanga reo extend children‚Äôs understanding of the wider social and natural world. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated in everyday activities. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are included in the programme.</p><p>Parents have established a highly inclusive culture where all families are welcomed, supported and empowered to be contributing members. Relationships among children and parents are positive, trusting and nurturing. Interactions with children support their sense of belonging, confidence and language development. Babies and toddlers are fully included in programme activities, and benefit from the responsiveness of adults and older children to their interests and non-verbal communications.</p><p>Children‚Äôs individual portfolios are attractive, well-maintained by parents, and include examples of their children‚Äôs learning and involvement in the programme. The qualified supervisor provides good quality models of assessment and planning that reflect how older children‚Äôs learning is being recognised and extended. Playcentre courses are provided locally by the association to support emergent leadership and develop parents‚Äô knowledge of early childhood education.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Centre parents have identified a need to strengthen their planned self review processes. ERO agrees this would be an appropriate next step. Self review could be used to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>the effectiveness of improvements to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>the influence of members‚Äô involvement in recent professional development and learning on these processes.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kuiti Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Equity Funding - Action for compliance</h3><p>The service is not meeting some of the Equity Funding reporting requirements. In order to address this, the service provider must:</p><p>Report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their Equity Funding. Reporting must include:</p><ul>
<li>an outline of the amount received under each Equity Funding component</li>
<li>a brief description of the purpose to which the funding was applied</li>
<li>a brief outline of the reasons for spending the funding in that way.</li>
</ul><p>The report must be included in the service's annual report for presentation at its annual general meeting [if any]<a name="sdendnote1anc" href="/review-reports/te-kuiti-playcentre-11-02-2013/#sdendnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p><em>[Early Childhood Funding Handbook - Chapter 10, Equity Funding]</em></p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><p><a name="sdendnote1sym" href="/review-reports/te-kuiti-playcentre-11-02-2013/#sdendnote1anc">1</a> Services who are privately owned may not have an Annual General Meeting</p>
