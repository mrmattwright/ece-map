</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Before Six Early Educational Childhood Centre provides education and care for children of the rural and seaside communities surrounding Mangawhai. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 15 under two, and has 81 children on the roll. Most children are New Zealand European/PƒÅkehƒÅ or MƒÅori.</p><p>Babies and children up to the age of two have a separate programme in the Pohutukawa room and outdoor play area. Older children are in the Kauri room. Each area of the centre has a supervisor. The Pohutukawa and Kauri rooms and the playground are designed so that younger children can communicate with and sometimes join their older friends and siblings.</p><p>The centre changed ownership in October 2012. The current owner recently employed a new manager who has extensive experience in early childhood education. The owner, the manager and four other staff are registered teachers. Several of the staff have worked at the centre since it opened in 2006. A cook is employed to provide nutritious meals for children.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2010 report noted many positive aspects of the centre. The new owner and manager have been addressing development areas that were identified in 2010 and adapting practices to align with their philosophy of teaching and learning.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well cared for by teachers who prioritise their wellbeing and education. Teachers know the children well and their interactions with them are positive and affirming. Teachers take time to talk with whƒÅnau and share information about the children‚Äôs experiences at home and at the centre.</p><p>The purpose built premises are well designed, maintained and resourced. Teachers are thoughtful in the way they organise and make resources available to children. Children enjoy a wide range of learning opportunities and older children help decide on the layout of play areas.</p><p>The programme enables children to make choices about their play. Teachers help them access equipment and support their learning through conversation. Older children have opportunities at morning hui to reflect on the previous day and plan their play with teachers. Teachers have begun changing the way that children‚Äôs learning is assessed and how the learning programme is planned and evaluated.</p><p>Teachers are working together successfully to build their capacity and confidence to incorporate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into the programme. Some teachers are leading this centre-wide initiative. The positive impacts for children are very evident through their participation in related learning activities.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and between the Pohutukawa and Kauri rooms are well managed. New parents and children have opportunities to get to know the people at the centre and become familiar with the environment. The process of moving children to the Kauri room is gradual, at a pace that suits the child. By the time they transition they know the teachers and the children in the older age group. The centre has a goal to strengthen the relationship that they have with the local primary schools to better support children‚Äôs transition to school.</p><p>Centre operations and developments are guided by the owner‚Äôs and manager‚Äôs sound knowledge of good practice in early childhood education, and leadership and management processes. Centre leaders used this knowledge to review the operation of the centre and make changes where appropriate. Changes are made in consultation with staff and at an appropriate pace. Centre managers are exploring ways to record self-review processes and strategic planning and to tracking progress towards meeting strategic goals.</p><p>Teachers are committed to improving programmes for children and value opportunities for professional learning. Staff appraisal processes are being strengthened by making the appraisal system more improvement focused and by providing professional development that supports staff to work towards common goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with centre managers that they should continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>teaching and learning philosophy with staff and use this to evaluate and guide future teaching and learning developments</li>
<li>self review and strategic planning processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Before Six Early Educational Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Before Six Early Educational Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
