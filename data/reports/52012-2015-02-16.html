</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association’s playcentres during Term 4, 2014.</p><p>The centre is open for five mornings per week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid supervisor supports parents and whānau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members’ practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together’, encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whānau working collectively to support children’s learning.</p><p>Since the May 2012 ERO report, centre members have made significant improvements to the learning environment. This playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO. At the time of this review, all parents at this centre are undertaking Playcentre training.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents encourage children’s learning through following their initiated activities. Children’s play is well supported by adults who frequently set up activities to further engage individuals’ interest and participation. ERO observed cooperative play and tuakana teina relationships where older children support and play with those who are younger. Infants and toddlers are well supported to explore, interact and play with attentive adults and each other. Children are encouraged to become capable and independent explorers.</p><p>A strong family atmosphere pervades the centre. The tone is very positive and relaxed. Children are settled and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Parents are nurturing and cooperative, they attend to each others' children, who are comfortable relating to adults who are not their parents. Members are empowered and support each other. They share ideas about positive parenting.</p><p>Programme planning is in the early stages of development. It is informed by children’s interests, parents’ ideas and session evaluations. Adults are beginning to capture the observed interests of their own children and those of others through learning stories and photographs. Participation in playcentre-run courses should further build members’ consistency of practice in assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning.</p><p>Centre members communicate with each other about centre events and children’s development using information and communication technologies. Parents enjoy making contributions. Portfolios provide a record of children’s enjoyment and involvement in playcentre experiences and excursions into the wider community.</p><p>Inclusive practice is highly evident. Adults recognise and respect children’s different personalities, abilities, needs and interests. There is good knowledge of local agencies and suitable strategies that promote children’s and their families’ active participation at playcentre. Routines are enjoyable, unobtrusive and child-centred.</p><p>Centre members are beginning to provide children with experiences that assist them to become confident in Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. This area is an ongoing focus for development and improvement. Pacific children have a strong sense of belonging at the centre.</p><p>Centre members work collaboratively to put systems in place to guide centre practices and operations. Self review is in the early stages of development. It is responsive and beginning to be understood by parents. They should continue to develop self review practice to enable ongoing improvement.</p><p>Useful support is provided by the association. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finance and legislative obligations. Work is being completed to improve employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach.</p><p>The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members’ understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>liaison support so it is consistently effective in identifying and responding to centre needs</li>
<li>appraisal for employees</li>
<li>members’ understanding about te ao Māori.</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>developing all members’ participation and understanding of assessment, planning , evaluation and self review</li>
<li>increasing parents’ confidence to further incorporate te ao Māori throughout the curriculum</li>
<li>using strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Playcentre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region</p><p>16 February 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
