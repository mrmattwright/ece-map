</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Park Road Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association‚Äôs playcentres during Term 4, 2014.</p><p>The centre is open for five mornings per week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid team leader supports parents and whƒÅnau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members‚Äô practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association.</p><p>Since the June 2012 ERO report, the centre has had several changes of team leader. At the time of this review, an acting team leader is supporting members. A high proportion of parents have gained course two, or above, Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>Parents come from a wide geographical area and represent a range of ethnicities and cultures. Many families have connections with the nearby military camp and tertiary institutions, so there is a regular turnover of members.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì ‚Äòfamilies growing together‚Äô, encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whƒÅnau working collectively to support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of the centre is well reflected in practice. Adults view children as competent and capable of leading their own learning. Experiences are planned to effectively promote children‚Äôs self management, independence and creative self expression. Children are confident, cooperative and friendly.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau work well as a team to engage children‚Äôs interest and involvement in activities. High ratios of adults promote opportunities for sustained one-to-one interactions .The team leader is focused on supporting children‚Äôs language and social development. Their strengths and interests are well known by all.</p><p>Further development strategies that members can use to extend children‚Äôs ideas and understanding should be a focus for improved practice.</p><p>The environment provides a variety of learning experiences for children. Carefully organised resources are freely available. An interesting outdoor area provides children with opportunities for challenge, inquiry and physical activities. Nearby parks and gardens are well used for excursions.</p><p>Further provision of opportunities for children to see their work and reflect on their achievements is an appropriate development step.</p><p>Inclusive centre practices support families with children with diverse needs, cultural backgrounds and aspirations. Good use of local agencies promotes participation of children with special needs. Families‚Äô cultural practices are shared and celebrated.</p><p>Infants and toddlers fully participate in sessions and learn alongside older children. A suitable range of sensory materials and equipment caters for their use.</p><p>Progress has been made to integrate more bicultural perspectives in the curriculum. Children learn waiata, protocols and short phrases in te reo MƒÅori. Members identify the need for ongoing support and resources to further develop their awareness and confidence to promote te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. The association should give priority to supporting members define their understanding of success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</p><p>Children‚Äôs developing interests are regularly discussed and recorded. Daily evaluation meetings are used for reflection and planning. Regular meetings provide opportunities for collaborative reflection and for parents to share their aspirations for their children.</p><p>Carefully presented portfolios record children‚Äôs special learning moments linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Increased participation of parents in assessment and planning for learning is actively supported by the core group of more experienced members. Further development of children‚Äôs use of mathematical language and ideas should improve their confidence as mathematical learners.</p><p>Strengthening children‚Äôs transition to school is an area of ongoing development.</p><p>Strong and committed leadership by a core group of members is promoting sustained good practice. Mutual support and an emphasis on relationship-building is fostering parents‚Äô confidence and willingness to become involved.</p><p>Self review is valued as a process to promote improvement. Collaborative reviews of many aspects of practice are evident. The strategic plan and actions outline a clear direction for centre development. Further development of more evaluative review based on good practice indicators to inform decisions is a next step.</p><p>Useful support is provided by the association. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finance and legislative obligations. Work is being completed to improve employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach.</p><p>The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and development goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, the priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members‚Äô understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>liaison support so it is consistently effective in identifying and responding to centre needs</li>
<li>appraisal for employees</li>
<li>members‚Äô understanding around the concept of success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>to continue to develop the quality of members‚Äô practice in assessment, planning, evaluation and self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Park Road Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance.</p><ul>
<li>The service provider must ensure human resource management practices are implemented including a system of regular appraisal.¬†<em>[Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 GMA7]</em></li>
<li>The association should ensure that Education Act requirements for police vetting of employees are consistently met.¬†<em>[Education Act 1989, sections 78CB and CC]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Park Road Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>11 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
