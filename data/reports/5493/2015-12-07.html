</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below. </p><h3>Background</h3><p>Corstorphine Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). The kindergarten philosophy shows that teachers prioritise having a safe, happy and welcoming place where children can learn and play together. Since the closure of the local school, the kindergarten has become a hub for local families to meet socially.</p><p>The kindergarten provides a mixed-age programme for children aged from two-to-five years from 8:30am to 2:30pm each day. The children come from diverse backgrounds. Children’s various cultures are reflected throughout the kindergarten environment.</p><p>At the time of this review, the head teacher was on leave and an acting head teacher had been appointed. There were also other staff changes and the association was working to fill vacancies. Apart from the head teacher all teachers are part time. This presents challenges for ensuring consistent practices and shared understandings.</p><p>Some progress has been made in addressing the recommendations from the 2012 ERO review. These are still work in progress.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, caring relationships with their teachers. Teachers have a strong focus on pastoral care for children and their families. In partnership with the Salvation Army they provide food and counselling to families in need and support them to access specialist agencies. Parents see this as a safe and welcoming place. The kindergarten and local schools work together to enable smooth transitions for children to school. </p><p>Children are well supported to develop friendships, learn to play independently and alongside others and practise problem solving. Children are seen as able and are confident to make choices within the kindergarten. The indoor and outdoor areas are purposefully arranged to provide children with a variety of spaces to explore and develop their physical skills. Teachers listen to what children are interested in and plan a wide range of experiences that stimulate children’s curiosity. For example, children benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>regular small group activities such as music and movement</li>
<li>incorporating early mathematics and literacy in meaningful ways</li>
<li>gardening and baking</li>
<li>sensory experiences</li>
<li>excursions linked to the term focus.</li>
</ul><p>Currently evaluations of programmes and practices are mostly descriptive. These would be more useful if teachers evaluated how well they have met the intended purposes and made the necessary changes to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>A strength of this kindergarten is the way parents come together and contribute their skills to celebrate important cultural events, such as Matariki and Polyfest. Māori and Pacific cultures are strongly reflected in the environment.</p><p>Teachers focus on helping children to express themselves through oral language. They deliberately work on children being able to pronounce words correctly.</p><p>Profile books are an attractive record of each child’s journey through kindergarten. They are well loved by children who sit together and with adults to relive their experiences and learning. The best examples of children’s learning records show continuity of learning, progress and what strategies teachers will use. However, the quality of these is variable.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association. </li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to develop sustainable systems to support assessment, planning and evaluation. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>consistency in writing learning stories that show continuity and progress of children's learning and strategies teachers use to support learning</li>
<li>ensuring children’s next steps for learning are shared with all teachers</li>
<li>gathering and responding to parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning</li>
<li>evaluation of group planning.</li>
</ul><p>The head teacher and teachers have identified that they need to develop a shared understanding of rigorous self review and use this to make improvements.</p><p>With changes in the leadership and teaching team (mostly part-time) there needs to be an ongoing focus on further developing and sustaining systems for effective communication about children’s needs, programmes, practices and operations. It is also timely to review the philosophy to ensure there is a shared understanding of priorities for learning.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved  in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association's vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher, it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistently high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Corstorphine Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Corstorphine Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>7 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
