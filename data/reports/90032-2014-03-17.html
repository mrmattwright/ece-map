</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Invercargill North is one of four Invercargill centres owned by Kidicorp. It is located close to the central city and provides all-day education and care for up to 75 children. Children are grouped in one of four classrooms according to their age. Most of the teaching staff are qualified and have worked at the centre for a number of years. A new centre manager and a professional services manager were appointed in July 2013.</p><p>Since the last review in November 2012, there has been significant positive progress made in addressing ERO‚Äôs recommendations. This includes improvements to:</p><ul>
<li>the indoor and outdoor areas</li>
<li>the range of resources in the toddlers‚Äô room</li>
<li>the way that children transition between classrooms</li>
<li>leadership and the development of a positive team culture within the centre.</li>
</ul><p>There is now a strong focus on improvement evident in every-day practice. The manager and teachers work well together to provide positive outcomes for children. They create a welcoming environment and are strengthening partnerships with families.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that the teachers aim to provide children with safe, fun and challenging programmes where their independence is fostered.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from caring and responsive relationships with their teachers. The teachers know the children and their whƒÅnau well. They have meaningful conversations with children and take an interest in their lives beyond the centre. The teachers are quick to follow children‚Äôs leads. Children play well with each other. They play in well-organised, calm and settled classrooms. ERO observed children having fun with their teachers and with each other.</p><p>The programmes are planned around children‚Äôs interests. Teachers have made a good start in providing environments where children can make choices and their independence is fostered.</p><p>The redeveloped outdoor environment now provides more choice and challenge for children to develop their physical skills. Children enjoy a wide range of experiences within the programme. These include:</p><ul>
<li>music and movement</li>
<li>creative and dramatic play</li>
<li>outings in the community</li>
<li>planned activities linked to the group programmes</li>
<li>hearing some te reo MƒÅori singing, waiata and learning tikanga MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><p>Older children benefit from early literacy and mathematics experiences throughout the day. Children within the centre know the routines and the ways their teachers expect them to play together.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for in the centre. Teachers are attentive in meeting the care needs of infants and toddlers. They ensure that the pace of the day is relaxed and infant‚Äôs individual routines are responded to. Teachers support toddlers to develop their early language and social skills.</p><p>There are useful systems for planning and evaluating group programmes. Children‚Äôs profile books have regular entries and are attractive records of each child‚Äôs time at the centre.</p><p>The centre manager is providing effective leadership. She has high expectations for children‚Äôs care and education and has systems to make sure these are met. She values the knowledge and skills within her team and finds way for these skills to be used. She is supported in her role by a newly-developed leadership team.</p><p>The centre manager receives good support from the Kidicorp organisation through:</p><ul>
<li>a clear policy framework, operational guidelines and quality audit processes</li>
<li>regional managers‚Äô regular visits with support, advice and feedback.</li>
</ul><p>The regional Kidicorp managers have supported the centre manager to develop useful planning which guides the centre‚Äôs priorities for ongoing improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There needs to be a greater focus on learning for individual children and group planning. Records need to more clearly show children‚Äôs next learning steps and how these led to progress over time. Records need to show how teachers have responded to parents‚Äô wishes for their children. Group programmes should have a stronger identified focus on learning. Evaluations need to show what children have learned and the impact of teaching.</p><p>The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they are in the early stages of reviewing the quality of their own practices. The leaders and teachers need to continue to develop a better understanding of self review and then implement effective self-review processes and practices.</p><p>The manager and the team show a strong commitment to strengthening bicultural practices. The next step is for leaders and teachers to implement planning to strengthen bicultural programmes and practices. This should include building teachers‚Äô confidence and competence in using te reo MƒÅori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Invercargill North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Invercargill North will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>17 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
