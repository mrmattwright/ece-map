</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The homebased education and care service Nurture Nannies 2 is located in Hamilton and is one of three networks operated by a private company Nurture Learning Limited. This is a quality funded network where all educarers are trained. The network is licensed for 80 children including up to 80 children aged under two years. At the time of this review the roll was 47 of whom nine identify as Māori and 10 as Chinese.</p><p>The licensee is the owner and director of the Nurture Nannies network. A qualified and registered visiting teacher oversees the quality of education and care. Each educarer is able to care for up to four children in the home. Visiting teachers and educators have participated in targeted professional learning to develop their knowledge and skills. A particular focus in teaching and learning has been in kaupapa Māori.</p><p>The service's philosophy aims to 'support, educate, nurture and empower each child, their family and educators in a holistic home environment.' The whakatauaki of the service is 'He tamaiti ako ana i te kāinga, te turanga ki te ao hurihuri, māia ana' (A child who is taught at home, will stand confident in the changing world.)</p><p>Since the ERO report of 2012 there have been changes to ownership and several visiting teachers have left the service. Two new visiting teachers were appointed in June 2015 and the service has been supported by a fluent Mandarin speaking advisor. The remaining visiting teacher has provided continuity for children, families and whānau through a time of change.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report, identified the need to further develop internal evaluation processes to monitor the building of educators’ knowledge and review the access to quality educational resources for children. There has been some positive development in these areas. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a curriculum that is responsive to their language culture and identity. Visiting teachers engage with children, their families and educarers in their home languages to support learning. Responsive relationships between educarers and other adults involved in the children’s learning are strengthened by a wide range of knowledge and skills for providing learning experiences. Children experience positive interactions that contribute to meaningful learning opportunities.</p><p>An experienced and knowledgeable visiting teacher team works collaboratively in the best interest of children their families and educarers. Their focus on equity and inclusion has resulted in children and their families demonstrating a strong sense of well-being. Cultural responsiveness is highly evident through the acknowledgement of children’s language, culture and identity in teaching and learning. The service employs an interpreter to work alongside visiting teachers, educarers, children and their families. Children with learning challenges have been identified and visiting teachers now need to formalise how they respond to these priority learners. Positive relationships between visiting teachers, educarers, children and their families are providing reciprocal learning partnerships that are purposeful.</p><p>Effective planning by visiting teachers, provides clear expectations for educarers to support children’s learning. Role modelling of best practice by visiting teachers supports educarers to provide positive learning programmes for children. This includes a strong focus on delivering culturally responsive practice to meet the diverse needs of children and their families. Families are encouraged to participate in wider community activities that include playgroups, music sessions and visits to places of interest to support children’s social competence.</p><p>Assessment practices value and respond to all cultures knowledge and ways of learning. Visiting teachers are able to show over time how educarers are supported to strengthen their knowledge of assessment practices. A next step for visiting teachers is to assist some educarers to identify and document what learning has happened, how to extend this learning, and show progress of learning over time.</p><p>There is a robust process that guides internal evaluation of curriculum to inform the continuous cycle of improvement and change. Children and educarers benefit from visiting teachers who are reflective and responsive.</p><p>Children are supported to follow their individual interests and are empowered to make choices about their learning. They participate and have access to a range of resources in music, science mathematics and literacy. The curriculum is designed to include learning about te Ao Māori through te reo and tikanga, waiata and places of significance for tangata whenua. Children experience a rich curriculum where they are listened to and encouraged to become confident and successful learners and explorers.</p><p>Children up to the age of two enjoy positive responsive one-to-one interactions. Infants and toddlers experience continuity of connection between visiting teachers, educarers, families and whānau.</p><p>The service's philosophy, vision, goals and policies have been established to provide positive outcomes for children. Policies and procedures have been documented to guide the services operations. The development of a strategic and annual plan to systematically review update and ratify these guiding documents needs to be implemented. In addition, systems to ensure regular documented reporting and robust quality assurance of operational management also needs to be implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve practice the director and visiting teachers need to attend to the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthen the quality of the annual plan so that it provides documented guidance for service operations. This plan needs to provide a sound foundation for ongoing internal evaluation and improvement in outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organise suitable human resource management practices to provide clear expectations and guidance for educarers and staff, including formalising appraisal policy and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the leadership roles and responsibilities within the service to provide clearer direction and expectations for visiting teachers. The director, in consultation with visiting teachers, should also consider engaging an external appraiser to further contribute to their professional learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nurture Nannies 2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>Management and visiting teachers develop an annual plan that provides documented guidance for service operations. This plan needs to provide a sound foundation for ongoing internal evaluation and improvement in outcomes for children.</p><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Homebased Education and Care Services 2008, GMA 8]</em> </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nurture Nannies 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>5 September 2017 </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"></a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
