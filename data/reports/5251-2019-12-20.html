</table><p><span>Bulls Kindergarten¬†<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bulls Kindergarten opens Monday to Friday from 8.30am until 2.30pm. Full day places are available to children from two to six years. At the time of this review, there were 51 children enrolled and nine identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises whƒÅnau, community and environment. This is underpinned by the tikanga of tangata whenuatanga, ako, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and wƒÅnanga.</p><p>The kindergarten is administered by the Ruahine Kindergarten Association (the association). The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the chief executive officer who is responsible to the board. An operations manager supports the service‚Äôs compliance and policy development. Two senior teachers provide educational leadership across the teaching teams.</p><p>Since the March 2016 ERO report, the service has experienced significant staffing changes. The previous ERO report identified that Bulls Kindergarten should continue to use effective internal evaluation to enhance learning outcomes for children. Although some aspects of effective internal evaluation have been sustained, this is an area that requires further development once the new teaching team becomes established.</p><p>This kindergarten is part of the South Rangitikei KƒÅhui Ako and a member of the Enviroschools programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews and one early learning service review in the Ruahine Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The tikanga and values of the philosophy are highly evident in practice. Respectful relationships and ako promote an environment where children and teachers learn from each other. The¬†well-considered programme is responsive to their interests. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging as they lead their own learning and engage with a wide range of resources.</p><p>A strong focus on developing a print-rich environment and early language development is a feature of this kindergarten. Self-help skills and independence are fostered to build children's confidence in their abilities. Teachers continue to work collaboratively with Samoan families to build an understanding of their culture, language and identity and inclusion within the programme.</p><p>Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are evident within the environment. Children have opportunities to participate in karakia and through the Enviroschools philosophy to learn about MƒÅori concepts. Teachers have identified that a next step is to continue to strengthen their understanding of place-based education and weave this through their localised curriculum. ERO's external evaluation affirms this.</p><p>Transition processes into the kindergarten are thoughtfully designed to respond to the individual needs of children and their families. Strong reciprocal relationships with local schools foster successful transitions. Regular excursions provide meaningful learning opportunities and nurture connections to the local community.</p><p>A range of strategies successfully promotes parent involvement in centre events. Leaders have identified that a next step is to continue to strengthen their response to whƒÅnau voice to further develop the curriculum. Allowing space for MƒÅori and Pacific families to define what educational success looks like for their children should deepen how teachers respond to the individual aspirations they have for their children.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with parents and external agencies to promote an inclusive learning environment for children who require additional support. Intentional teaching strategies to progress children's learning are clearly identified and implemented to engage them in an inclusive learning environment.</p><p>Children's interests, dispositions and centre values are regularly highlighted. Deliberate teaching strategies to progress children's learning are clearly identified within children's learning portfolios. A key next step for teachers is to consider how the individual planning process can be extended to all children, and how parent aspirations are responded to within the process.</p><p>Senior teachers work collaboratively to build teacher and leadership capability. There is a strong commitment to growing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning, research opportunities and the sharing of good practice.</p><p>Regular review and inquiry have improved systems and processes to support positive learning outcomes for children. As a newly established team, further evaluating the impact of initiatives to see what is working well and who for, is a next step to identify and target specific areas for improvement.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Robust systems and processes are in place for reporting, monitoring and evaluating the quality of operations. Information is used to inform decision making and to improve the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At kindergarten level, priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Teachers' understanding of place-based education to inform the local curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the individual planning and assessment process to show how teachers are supporting all children to progress their individual learning pathways in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all teachers' understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level, the Ruahine Kindergarten Association have identified that their priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen and build their knowledge and understanding of tikanga MƒÅori and seek engagement with local iwi, with kaumatua support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support Bulls Kindergarten to embed internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bulls Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve compliance practice the service should include an individual risk assessment for all regular outings.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>20 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
