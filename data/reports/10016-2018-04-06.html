</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>The City Impact Church Care and Education service is part of the educational campus of the City Impact Church in Browns Bay. It is one of two early learning services owned and operated by the church. It is licensed for 128 children, including up to 30 children aged under two years, in all-day education and care. Forty percent of the children enrolled are Chinese, and there are small groups of children of other diverse ethnicities.</p><p>The Christian-based philosophy and vision guide teacher practices. Education and care are offered in an environment of spiritual character, values and principles. It is important to the service to provide an environment where children and families feel safe, nurtured and at home.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, the service has undergone a re-structure. The centre is now divided into four rooms for different age-groups, including a separate building for preschool (4 to 5 year old) children. Outdoor areas for children up to four years allows for some mixed-age play opportunities. Infants and toddlers have their own outdoor space.   </p><p>The manager, centre supervisor and mentor teacher provide leadership for the large teaching team. Four team leaders have oversight of staff and the daily running of each room. The mentor teacher provides ongoing support and professional development for provisionally certificated teachers. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified positive relationships, good professional learning opportunities and good support for children who speak languages other than English. These aspects continue to be noteworthy. The report also identified areas for improvement, including learning partnerships with families, the integration of Māori perspectives and the explicit use of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and confident, and interact well with their peers and teachers. They are encouraged to take increasing responsibility for their own and others' wellbeing. Their social and emotional competence is promoted well.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, managers have established consistent caregiving practices for children up to three years old. Teachers respond sensitively to each child's changing needs and preferences. They recognise that continuity is important in establishing a secure foundation for young children's care and education. Children who have additional learning needs receive good support.</p><p>Children come from a range of cultural backgrounds with the largest group being Chinese. Staff who are speakers of children's home languages communicate well with children and their families. This use of home languages strengthens relationships.</p><p>Teachers who are culturally competent often share their knowledge with colleagues. Events such as Waitangi Day and Matariki are celebrated with children and families. Centre managers are committed to enhancing the service's bicultural curriculum and supporting teachers to use te reo Māori with children.</p><p>Children over two years of age participate in a semi-structured programme, and freely explore the environment. Teachers provide activities that support children's play choices. They could continue to improve the quality of the programme and the extent to which they foster children's language development through meaningful conversations.</p><p>Centre managers have started to review the learning environment. Creating homely, child-friendly and whānau-friendly spaces is a priority. Using research, and developing a responsive learning environment that supports children's cultures, interests and dispositions are likely to help improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Transition processes are well considered. They support children's sense of belonging as they transition into the service, between rooms, and when moving on to school. The centre manager is exploring opportunities to enhance relationships with local early learning services and schools, and to support children's transitions to school.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes are well established. Centre managers include parents in internal evaluation and are responsive to their input. Appraisal processes have been strengthened. Managers agree that it is timely to review leadership opportunities that could support the enactment of the service's goals and priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for ongoing improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen long-term planning to support the implementation of annual goals, and the evaluation of centre practices against measurable indicators</li>
<li>further support the emergent curriculum through ongoing<strong> </strong>external professional development to help teachers to improve planning, assessment and evaluation processes</li>
<li>develop a child-centred curriculum that builds on children’s individual interests and promotes their creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of City Impact Church Care and Education completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice managers should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen processes for recording accidents and undertaking analysis, so as to minimise or remove risk to children.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of City Impact Church Care and Education will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>6 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
