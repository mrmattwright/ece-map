</table><p>Potiki Early Childhood Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Potiki Early Childhood Centre is situated in Clendon Park, Manurewa. It is in the same complex as the Taonga Teen Parent Unit and borders Waimahia Intermediate School. The centre serves many of the parents who are continuing their education at the teen parent unit. This complex has an extensive social services team that supports young parents, their children, and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 39 children, with most under two years of age. Children experience spacious and attractive indoor and outdoor areas in a mixed-age setting. The indoor space allows infants and toddlers to move, play and explore safely while still maintaining connections with older children.</p><p>The Potiki Early Childhood Centre is one of six early childhood services governed by the Taonga Education Trust. The chief executive and the operations manager of the trust provide governance and management support for the centre supervisor, and maintain a strong interest in promoting positive outcomes for children and whƒÅnau. In 2018 a new centre manager was appointed.</p><p>The centre philosophy highlights a vision for a whƒÅnau-centred service. A responsive curriculum is promoted. Parents' values and aspirations for their children are included in the programme. The centre aims to provide a learning environment that supports children to strive forward with belief and confidence.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified many areas of good practice including good levels of care, a strong sense of belonging, tuakana/teina relationships, and the promotion of children's language culture and identity. The report recommended that the centre include more opportunities for science and mathematics learning, strengthen the role of teachers in extending the complexity of children‚Äôs play, and review teacher appraisal. These continue to be areas for ongoing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers welcome children and their whƒÅnau with warmth and cheerful conversation. The tone in the centre is calm and inclusive. Children settle quickly to self-chosen activities, making connections with friends and engaging them in their play. They are confident and eager to share conversations with teachers and to explore the environment prepared for them.</p><p>Children benefit from the well-resourced environment, including the interesting and challenging outdoor playground. Many activities are suggested and chosen by children. This is a positive outcome from teachers' encouragement for children to be confident decision makers.</p><p>The morning hui with parents and their children increase teachers' focus on te reo MƒÅori me ≈çna tikanga. Teachers are becoming more confident to build their knowledge in this area. They promote practices that enable children to reach their full potential, as defined in the Taonga acronym, ‚ÄòTotally Acknowledging Our Next Generation‚Äôs Abilities'.</p><p>Teachers recognise parents/whƒÅnau as first teachers and build respectful, reciprocal relationships. They weave parent aspirations through the learning programmes. A focus on developing children's oral literacy skills further promotes strong partnerships with their homes.</p><p>The centre manager supports teachers well to help children learn through play. She is developing planning, assessment and evaluation processes and includes teachers in planning and centre decision making. A new format for individual planning requires teachers to focus more on identifying teaching strategies that enhance children's learning.</p><p>The manager is supported by the trust to operate the centre efficiently. A policy framework, and effective health and safety systems are in place. Teacher appraisals are not yet working effectively. The policy and procedures are not fully understood and do not provide clear guidelines for staff.</p><p>An overarching board strategic plan identifies goals for improvement. Monitoring and documenting progress towards these goals would help the trust to gauge how well the centre is on track to achieve its strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Trust representatives agree that the key next steps for the service and the trust include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop assessment and planning processes to include children's contributions and to identify children's individual interests and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the appraisal policy and procedures to help the centre manager to undertake robust staff appraisals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly review policies, procedures and practices to ensure they align with the centre's philosophy and legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Potiki Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>14 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
