<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>St Georges Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>St Georges Preschool is situated behind the St Georges Anglican Church in Papatoetoe, Auckland. The centre is one of two early childhood services and social support services that are owned and operated by The Anglican Trust for Women and Children (ATWC).</p><p>ATWC provides support for families from diverse and complex backgrounds. Teachers welcome and include the multi-cultural families enrolled. Putting families first is a significant feature of this preschool.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review. It is licensed for 50 children and was opened in 2010. The centre has made good progress with the support of the ATWC centre director and an experienced centre manager who oversees centre operation and administration.</p><p>Policies and systems are well established, and reviews are underway to further improve teaching practices and extend the learning programme to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Positive and respectful relationships between teachers, children and their parents and whƒÅnau are strengths of the centre and give each child and their family a sense of belonging. The interactions of considerate and sensitive adults who value children‚Äôs learning and development promote a nurturing programme for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Children are happy and settle quickly when they arrive. Friendships between children are well established. They sustain their play interests for long periods, playing either independently or with others. Their learning is supported by skilled teachers who are qualified and experienced, and by the provision of a well resourced, attractive learning environment. Good quality resources invite exploration and encourage children‚Äôs imaginative play. Some teachers use opportunities to include aspects of early numeracy and literacy during children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Managers value the multi-ethnic backgrounds of children and their families and have deliberately employed teachers from a variety of cultures to reflect this diversity. The centre manager provides inclusive and collaborative leadership, enabling the teaching team to extend their professional practice and establishing robust systems and processes to guide centre operations.</p><p>As a result:</p><ul>
<li>teachers are increasing their understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development</li>
<li>child-focused programme planning is in place</li>
<li>the teaching team is stable and collaborative</li>
<li>teachers value their own cultural heritages and some use children‚Äôs home languages to communicate with them.</li>
</ul><p>The wellbeing and learning of MƒÅori and Pacific children and children with special needs are positively promoted. Families are encouraged to be active partners in the learning programme. The curriculum promotes children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities and is responsive to children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>Teachers are developing their experience in self review. Their review of curriculum areas has resulted in programme improvements and has built teachers‚Äô confidence to undertake more in-depth self review focused on improving outcomes for children. Self review has also helped managers and teachers to identify long and short-term goals for the centre. One of these goals is to extend and strengthen their commitment to bicultural practice. It would also be useful to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen documentation in children‚Äôs portfolios to better show the continuity and progress in children‚Äôs learning over time, and to establish a common language for sharing their learning with families</li>
<li>develop a parent education programme about the values of early childhood education</li>
<li>focus planning more directly on the learning that is occurring for children</li>
<li>review the quality of the learning programme against indicators of effective practice for early childhood education.</li>
</ul><p>Staff report to the ATWC board regularly. The board supports the director and manager to link the centre‚Äôs annual plans to the wider strategic vision and plans of the Trust. As a next step for improving practice, the director, centre manager and ERO discussed the benefits of:</p><ul>
<li>formalising progress reports for the board to document the outcomes of self review linked to the centre‚Äôs annual and strategic plans</li>
<li>regular teachers‚Äô appraisal linked to the New Zealand Teachers Council‚Äôs criteria for registered teachers</li>
<li>using an external early childhood advisor to appraise the performance of the centre manager.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Georges Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To promote better outcomes for children‚Äôs learning the managers must:</p><ul>
<li>implement a system for the regular appraisal of all staff¬†<em>[GMA7, Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 and the Early Childhood Education Curriculum Framework].</em></li>
