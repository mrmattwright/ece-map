<p>Very well placed</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Mt Wellington Playcentre is a well-established centre. It is licensed for 30 children, including 15 children up to the age of two years. The centre is cooperatively managed and programmes for children are implemented by centre members who have many years' experience. The centre offers four morning sessions each week.</p>
<p>The Playcentre philosophy of whƒÅnau and children learning together underpins centre operations.</p>
<p>The demographics in the local area have changed significantly over the past five years. Approximately a quarter of families involved in the centre are new to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Since the 2012 ERO report there has been significant improvement to the programme, the physical environment and members‚Äô practice. Some of this improvement has been the direct result of good quality professional development, strong leadership and Association support.</p>
<p>The centre is one of 16 Playcentres in the Tamaki Playcentre Association. The Association provides a management and policy framework to guide centre operations. Liaison officers and other Association staff provide support for centres, including adult education programmes to encourage children‚Äôs learning.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of three Playcentre reviews in the Tamaki Playcentre Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Centre members promote a welcoming and inclusive environment. Respectful relationships and positive interactions support children‚Äôs wellbeing, belonging and learning.</p>
<p>The centre is well resourced. Members provide children with a variety of learning experiences within the programme. Children confidently explore the environment and learn about the natural world. They have a sense of ownership in the centre. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is promoted through the small group size, and high adult-to-child ratios.</p>
<p>Members develop learning programmes that value children‚Äôs play and their emerging interests. As a result, children engage in meaningful play. Children are articulate and sustain their play for good periods of time. High levels of social interaction and cooperative play are evident. Children share equipment, take turns and show respect for each other when playing or working in groups.</p>
<p>The programme has clear links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children develop early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of their play. Members capture children‚Äôs interests and provide experiences to further extend their learning. They formally document these experiences in learning stories in children‚Äôs individual portfolios. Members could now consider how they could include other members‚Äô voices in children‚Äôs individual narratives, and how they could follow up on next steps identified in learning stories.</p>
<p>Centre members show a strong commitment to promoting a bicultural curriculum. Bicultural approaches are confidently modelled by centre leaders, who are developing ways to further integrate te ao MƒÅori meaningfully into the programme. Some members model and are gaining confidence in including other children‚Äôs ethnic languages in the context of play.</p>
<p>Displays in the environment are at children‚Äôs eye level and promote early literacy and mathematics learning. Curriculum areas are well defined. The environment is attractive and vibrant.</p>
<p>Centre leaders work well together, promoting a positive team culture. They encourage and support members to increase training levels. They have led self reviews that have had a positive impact in the programme and professional practice.</p>
<p>Association governance practices are well established. Raising awareness of the playcentre within the community so that centres are well attended is an ongoing focus for the Association. The Association is responsive to the needs of individual centres and provides support and guidance to manage the centres. Members are appreciative of the Association‚Äôs collaborative approach to assist them in promoting positive outcomes for children. Association leaders have made significant progress in aligning and monitoring systems and practices for centres. They could continue to support leaders to make processes more transparent for centre members.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and centre members discussed and agreed that next steps in the development of the centre include:</p>
<ul><li>strengthening planning, assessments and evaluation</li>
<li>aligning strategic and annual plans to clarify key actions in meeting the centre‚Äôs desired outcomes</li>
<li>strengthening the use of self review to help members further improve teaching and learning</li>
<li>promoting a more challenging programme for children</li>
<li>reviewing the provision of literacy, mathematics, science and technology in the learning programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mt Wellington Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Mt Wellington Playcentre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
