</table><p>Clandeboye Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clandeboye Preschool is a small, rural early childhood service governed by elected parents and appointed staff members. A parent group also provides ongoing support for the centre.</p><p>The preschool offers education and care for children from two years to school age. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers and one is in training to become a teacher. Parents regularly help in the learning programme.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, leaders, teachers and parents have reviewed the centre philosophy. They have yet to include bicultural perspectives in this key centre document. The governance group has clarified management and governance roles and responsibilities. They have also created and regularly monitor strategic and operational plans. Further work is needed to improve assessment and planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident in the centre. They are purposefully focused on their interests and chosen activities. Two-year-old children are well supported to actively participate in the programme and join the play of older children.</p><p>Children experience positive, nurturing relationships with their teachers. Teachers listen carefully, and make appropriate use of questioning to help children extend their interests and ideas.</p><p>Children benefit from the well-resourced and carefully presented indoor and outside environments. Teachers actively promote sustainable practices, caring for animals and the environment. The expansive outdoor area is regularly reviewed and new features added to promote learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Parents have many opportunities to be involved in the programme and operation of the centre. They are kept well informed about their child's time at the centre. Parents are frequently consulted about policy reviews and centre internal evaluation.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have established strong links to the local community. The centre manager is part of a Community of Learning (CoL) and is building positive relationships with the participating schools and early childhood services.</p><p>Leaders make good use of strategic planning to set clear priorities and goals for the centre. Their annual operational plan is well aligned to the strategic plan and both are regularly monitored. Teachers often engage in systematic internal evaluation that identifies where improvements can be made.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree, that the key next steps to improve outcomes for all children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>integrating te ao Māori more fully into centre practices and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving assessment, planning and evaluation processes to show more clearly outcomes for children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the four-year-old programme to ensure it effectively supports children transitioning to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop ways to include children’s home culture in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending appraisal practices to meet Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clandeboye Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Clandeboye Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>9 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
