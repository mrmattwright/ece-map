</table><p>The centre requires further development in:</p><ul>
<li>strategic planning,</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>self-review systems to improve the quality of the care and education provided for children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Sprouts Montessori Preschool is a privately owned education and care service located in Whakatane. The service is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 40 children, including up to eight under two years of age. There are currently 54 children enrolled, of whom seven are under two years of age, and 25 are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The owners share responsibility for governance and management matters. One owner oversees office administration, including finance and property matters. The other joint owner, who has early childhood and Montessori educational qualifications, fills the role of professional leader. There are no other formally designated leadership positions. All the current staff are new to their positions since the last ERO review in 2011. The service has maintained a high proportion of qualified staff.</p><p>The service aims to follow the Montessori methods of education to develop children‚Äôs love of learning, and help them become independent, confident and capable learners. The Montessori programme encourages learning opportunities in science, practical life, global citizenship and sensorial experiences. The two classrooms cater for different age groups attending, and the programme is organised to allow the older and younger children to socialise and play together for designated periods of the day.</p><p>In response to the recommendations in the previous ERO report an appraisal system was initiated towards the end of 2013, and reviews of aspects of centre organisation have been undertaken and documented. Self-review practices continue to be mostly informal, and a formal process needs to be developed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from respectful relationships with adults and develop a strong sense of belonging. They have opportunities to explore and play within a well-presented environment. Teachers know the children well, and are responsive to their emotional and physical needs. Familiar routines and celebrations promote a culture where children are valued and affirmed. Centre leaders and staff articulate a commitment to biculturalism. Several teachers have undertaken relevant professional development courses and recognise that this is an area for further development. The roll is becoming increasingly diverse and staff are making a conscious effort to respect and include all cultures through shared celebrations involving food.</p><p>The junior classroom maintains higher staff ratios and lower group sizes for working with the children who are under two years of age. This allows for responsive, one-to-one interactions and promotes secure relationships. Staff interpret and respond well to the non-verbal clues offered by infants and toddlers including body language, pointing and looking. These young children have access to their own well-resourced environment where they can safely explore and experience intellectual and social stimulation.</p><p>The programme reflects a combination of child-initiated and teacher-led activities. Children have opportunities to develop an awareness of the world around them and how they should care for it. Early language skills and mathematical concepts are well integrated throughout the programme and supported by high quality resources. Children and their families are well informed and supported as they transition within the centre, and to school.</p><p>The inside play areas are carefully prepared to allow children to access and engage with resources. All children have regular opportunities for physical challenge and exploration in the outdoor areas. Teachers prepare well-illustrated assessment portfolios to record each child‚Äôs participation in the programme. These portfolios are shared with parents, who feel well informed and encouraged to contribute to their child‚Äôs education.</p><p>ERO found that the Montessori approach was not consistently implemented across the centre. The professional leader works mainly in the senior classroom, and there is limited designated leadership in the junior classroom. Teachers have inadequate time for planning, assessment and evaluation of the programme and this makes the provision of a consistent, high quality programme difficult to sustain. Staff members are, however, informed about the opportunities for professional development and have the financial support available to attend relevant courses.</p><p>The owners revised the centre philosophy statement in 2013. This statement reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to Montessori educational approaches. Centre leaders seek to know and respond to parent aspirations for their children‚Äôs education and care.</p><p>Strategic planning and self review that leads to improvement and robust quality assurance remains an area for considerable strengthening. While there is a well-documented policy framework to guide centre operations and professional practice, current planning is largely informal. The owners articulated their ongoing priorities as:</p><ul>
<li>team building and working collaboratively with staff</li>
<li>maintaining the number of children enrolled</li>
<li>maintaining positive relationships and working constructively with parents and the community</li>
</ul><p>To strengthen their professional and organisational effectiveness, the owners recognise the benefit of continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>participate in relevant leadership and management courses</li>
<li>involve external input into the regular review of their own performance.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends the following key next steps as:</p><ul>
<li>developing and implementing a written strategic plan in collaboration with staff and the parent community</li>
<li>implementing and sustaining regular checks of equipment, premises and facilities to ensure hazards to children are identified, and eliminated or minimised</li>
<li>embedding more robust appraisal and professional support systems for both staff and management</li>
<li>formalising centre self review processes</li>
<li>reviewing and improving the working conditions and spaces provided for staff to plan, assess and evaluate the programme.</li>
</ul><p>These next steps are necessary for the owners to be assured they are meeting all their legislative requirements, building the professional capacity of their staff and effectively evaluating the quality of the education and care provided for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Sprouts Montessori Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Action for compliance</span></h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>regular documented checks of equipment, premises and facilities are carried out to ensure hazards to children are identified, and eliminated or minimised.¬†<em>Licensing criteria for Early Childhood and Care centres 2008: HS12</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Sprouts Montessori Pre-School will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>8 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
