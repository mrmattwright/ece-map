<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Paroa Playcentre is well placed to further promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Paroa Playcentre operates from new purpose-built facilities next door to the local school. Following a flood at its previous site, the centre operated from a local hall before moving into its attractive new buildings in October 2012. Playcentre management and parents are now developing the outdoor environment.</p><p>This playcentre is operating three mornings a week and caters for children from birth to six years old.</p><p>Paroa playcentre is one of ten parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Buller-Westland Playcentre Association. It is well supported by the Association.</p><p>Since the playcentre&rsquo;s last ERO review in March 2008, many of the good practices that were fostering children&rsquo;s learning and development have been maintained. Some improvements have occurred to centre programmes and practices. The parent group have had a strong focus on successfully improving centre facilities.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre provides a positive learning environment for children. Each session provides high adult to children ratios. Responsive relationships and the teamwork amongst parents and staff foster children&rsquo;s sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Children up to two years old are well integrated into the group setting and confidently explore and take part in all aspects of the programme. These children, as well as those who are older, have good opportunities to support and learn from each other.</p><p>The playcentre&rsquo;s curriculum is consistent with its philosophy and focuses on children and adults learning together. Teachers and parents build on children&rsquo;s interests and make activities enjoyable and meaningful. Children take part in varied learning experiences. They have access to a wide range of resources to support their play and have many opportunities to engage in uninterrupted play.</p><p>Teachers make good use of the local environment, natural resources and parents' knowledge and skills to enrich children&rsquo;s learning. Parents plan and evaluate activities in ways that help them to improve the opportunities children have to learn and develop.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s staff and parents use a variety of teaching practices that are known to help children learn and develop. For example:</p><ul>
<li>adults actively involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play in ways that extend their interests, social learning and language development</li>
<li>literacy and numeracy learning is naturally integrated into activities</li>
<li>adults give children choices and provide additional resources to support and extend their play</li>
<li>adults communicate regularly and openly in ways that help them to get to know the children well</li>
<li>assessment practices are helping adults to recognise and respond well to children&rsquo;s individual strengths, interests and needs.</li>
</ul><p>A strong sense of partnership exists among those involved with the Playcentre. This is fostered through building positive relationships and the effective involvement of parents in their child&rsquo;s learning and development. Children benefit from the way home experiences and parents as first teachers practices are extended between home and the centre.</p><p>The playcentre is well supported by its association. The association&rsquo;s policies and procedures provide a good basis for the playcentre&rsquo;s operation. It&rsquo;s goals give a clear focus for improvement. The team leader, office holders and other parents receive valuable support from their field worker. The association also provides good opportunities for parent education and professional development.</p><p>The playcentre&rsquo;s long serving team leader continues to model good quality teaching and child-centred decision making. Her working partnership with the centre&rsquo;s administrator is a key factor in the success of the centre. They have established a centre culture that fosters ongoing improvement.</p><p>The association and centre office holders have identified the need to involve more parents in leadership roles. They have begun to explore ways to make sure workloads are manageable with a suitable emphasis on encouraging parents to complete playcentre education courses. This should reduce the risk of parents being too dependent on Playcentre staff for aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operation and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and ERO agreed that in order to build on the best of current practices to promote children&rsquo;s learning centre staff and parents should:</p><ul>
<li>make learning goals for children clear and regularly review how goals are met</li>
<li>provide all children, including Maori, with better opportunities to learn about te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>reintroduce centre-based improvement plans and develop a more detailed self review programme and clearer processes for undertaking reviews</li>
<li>build on the efforts being made to have more parents complete Playcentre-based training and extend their involvement in leadership of the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paroa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
