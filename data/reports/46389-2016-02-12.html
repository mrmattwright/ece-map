</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Milky Way Early Learning Centre is a new centre which opened in March 2014. The centre is in a building adjacent to Saint David‚Äôs Church. It caters for employees‚Äô children from the nearby Orion Healthcare Ltd and other local businesses. The unique partnership with local industry is providing mutual benefits that support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>The well-established grounds and trees are a distinctive asset for children attending this city-centre service. The centre is licensed for 27 children including 7 up to the age of two years. It is part of the Chrysalis Group which has four centres in Tauranga and Auckland. A centralised organisational structure provides centres with shared systems and expectations.</p>
<p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy promotes caring for children, and providing them with imaginative and inspirational learning experiences. It stresses the importance of being prepared to learn through innovation, partnership and sustainability. An innovative visualisation and communication tool has been introduced for parents and teachers to share information about children‚Äôs learning.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau are welcomed into the centre. Individual children and their families are respected and valued. Teachers are genuinely sensitive to children‚Äôs learning and developmental needs. Parents visit the centre regularly during the day as it is close to their work. Children‚Äôs transitions into, within and out of the centre are well supported.</p>
<p>Children are encouraged to become confident learners. They freely follow their own individual and group interests. Children explore, create and find interest and new learning in a well-resourced environment. They have opportunities to lead and revisit their learning. Children learn to play cooperatively and to have meaningful conversations with each other and teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers actively encourage parents to be partners in children‚Äôs learning and development. Innovative assessment and planning practices enable teachers and parents to track children‚Äôs progress over time. Teachers provide a programme that links well to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers weave literacy, mathematics and science naturally into the programme developing children‚Äôs skills and knowledge in these areas.</p>
<p>Respectful relationships between teachers and children support the caring atmosphere in the centre. Teachers understand the value of children learning through fun. They skilfully extend children‚Äôs thinking and encourage tuakana/teina relationships between older and younger children.</p>
<p>Infants and toddlers know their teachers well and have time to develop positive relationships. They play independently and alongside older children. Children move freely between indoor and outdoor environments and have easy access to age appropriate resources and challenges which encourages exploration and creativity.</p>
<p>Children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds are recognised and respected. Teachers acknowledge the unique place of MƒÅori. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are encouraged. Teachers have reviewed the centre‚Äôs bicultural practices. ERO endorses staff's sincere commitment to undertake the necessary further developments in this area.</p>
<p>Teachers value ongoing professional learning that is purposeful and improves their practice. Centre owners and the manager have identified the importance of succession planning to sustain quality outcomes for children. They plan to increase the capability of a new manager and to develop a new level of management structure within the organisation.</p>
<p>The centre is well managed as a result of the good working relationship between the owners and centre manager. Management systems and high expectations are well documented, carried out and regularly reviewed. A culture of continuous improvement underpins centre operations. The owners recognise that optimising centralised systems across the four centres in the Chrysalis Group is a future focus.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The owners have identified building leadership capacity to support succession planning as a next step.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Milky Way Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Milky Way Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
