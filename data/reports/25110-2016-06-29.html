</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tu Manu Ae Le Tu Logologo Aoga Amata operates under the Papakura Pacific Island Presbyterian Church. The aoga philosophy promotes a total immersion Samoan programme and Christian values.</p><p>Since the time of the 2014 ERO review the aoga has had a change in leadership with a newly appointed service provider, manager and supervisor. The manager and supervisor were promoted from within the aoga. Personnel changes have renewed staff motivation to progress aoga improvements that benefit children. In 2014 aoga staff began working with external professional support to improve human resource management and curriculum. Some good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The board employs twelve staff, four of whom are qualified and provisionally certificated teachers. The teaching staff are continuing to work with external support to further improve the quality of the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are content and settled. Infants and toddlers experience nurturing care. Children enjoy spending their time playing and learning, and are well supported to make independent choices. Teachers are respectful and welcoming towards children and their families. Children openly question and confidently interact with their peers and adults.</p><p>Teachers have improved areas of play to emphasise early literacy and numeracy and to better support children's interactions and sustained play. They should now review the play areas to provide further challenge and opportunities for creative play that helps develop their dispositions. There is good provision for health and physical activity. The outdoor learning environment has been improved to better support the development of children's physical competence and capability.</p><p>Aspects of a bicultural curriculum are evident in the programme. Teachers should continue to participate in professional learning and development to strengthen the implementation of bicultural practices.</p><p>Teachers are growing their professional capacity. They have worked with external professional support to establish self-review and improve teaching and learning. Leaders have implemented curriculum guidelines to improve teachers' understanding and practice in planning, assessment and evaluation. Teachers are becoming increasingly aware of children's interests and strengths. They should now deepen the assessment and evaluation of individual children's learning and development and establish planning to extend children's learning.</p><p>Centre leaders have reviewed the aoga philosophy in consultation with teachers, parents and the board to ensure that it underpins children's learning needs and guides teacher practice. The last review was in 2015 as part of ongoing professional development. Maintaining an ongoing cycle of self-review will help to keep the philosophy up-to-date, reflective of current practice and meeting children's needs.</p><p>Aoga leaders have worked with external support to improve personnel management. A new appraisal system and process has recently been developed to meet Education Council requirements. Once it is implemented the performance management process should support staff to progress their provisional teaching certificates, develop reflective practice and grow leadership capacity.</p><p>The chairman of the board agrees that trustees are beginning to develop their understanding in governance. The board has successfully overseen minor property improvements and updated financial management practices. Improved reporting on curriculum, health and safety matters and parents' feedback would help to inform the board's decision making and future planning. The board would benefit from external support to establish self-review processes that will also inform their future planning and governance practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board should access external professional support to implement self-review and strategic planning that is focused on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers should continue to participate in ongoing external professional learning and development to strengthen their understanding and implementation of bicultural practices and effective curriculum and self-review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tu Manu Ae Le Tu Logologo Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current provision for children's health and safety, managers should prioritise training for staff in relation to the <em>Vulnerable Children Act, 2014.</em></p><p>ERO also identified an area of non-compliance relating to staffing during the review process. In order to meet requirements, centre managers must implement police vetting every three years for all staff who are not registered teachers.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tu Manu Ae Le Tu Logologo Aoga Amata will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
