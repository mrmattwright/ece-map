</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Y Kids is a mixed-aged, early childhood service operating under the umbrella of the local YMCA in central Gisborne. The service is licensed to provide all day education and care for 35 children, including 10 aged up to two. At the time of this review, 31 MƒÅori children attended. YMCA management provides business support for the centre.</p><p>The philosophy aligns with the values of YMCA and includes caring, respect, responsibility, honesty, open relationships and whakawhanaungatanga.</p><p>A head teacher manages the centre with support from the team leader.</p><p>The May 2015 ERO report identified areas for development as self review, including the philosophy, appraisal and assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Progress is evident in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a play-based curriculum. Their understanding of mathematical and literacy concepts are enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use these skills in their everyday lives.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children supporting and extending their learning. They know children well and support them to develop social competence.</p><p>Warm and responsive practices are evident with infants and toddlers. Teachers effectively support older children to develop an understanding of the special characteristics of infants and toddlers as they play and learn together.</p><p>Bicultural practice is developing. Teachers show a strong commitment to furthering their knowledge in this area. Recent refurbishments have increased the visibility of te ao MƒÅori within the environment. Leaders acknowledge that promoting educational success for MƒÅori is an area for ongoing development. There is a current focus on developing leaders' and teachers' understanding of culturally responsive practice to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Portfolios highlight children's learning and progress. Parents are partners in this process and regularly share their aspirations that form the basis of individual goals. Recent changes to this process have increased the alignment between planning and assessment. A next step is to develop consistent practice across the teaching team. Children's culture, language and identity should be more strongly reflected through this process.</p><p>Focused planning sets centre-wide priorities for children's learning. These priorities are highly evident in the daily programme and reflected in children's individual assessment information. This focus is leading to improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers work in partnership with parents and external agencies to improve outcomes for children. Comprehensive assessment and ongoing monitoring of progress towards identified goals occur.</p><p>The centre philosophy is clearly evident in curriculum design and teaching practice.</p><p>The appraisal process requires strengthening to better support teacher development. Next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the setting of specific, measurable and aspirational goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional learning and development that aligns to teachers' goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust appraisals that meet Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A useful framework to guide internal evaluation is evident. Leaders agree that a stronger evaluative focus is required to assist teachers to effectively judge how well the curriculum and teachers' practices support positive outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The governing body has wide responsibilities for a number of community services. A recent transition involves the centre manager input at board level. This has resulted in a renewed commitment by governors to high quality early childhood education provision.</p><p>Leaders ensure the service's vision, goals and practices are focused on learning and improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that areas for ongoing development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>promoting consistent, high quality assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teacher understanding and use of internal evaluation to identify what is going well and what more needs to be done to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Y Kids Community Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment and management of risks on excursions and documentation comprehensive enough to show how teachers plan to mitigate them. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Y Kids Community Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>25 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
