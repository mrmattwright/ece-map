</table><p>The Ministry of Education is currently providing targeted support to the Scallywaggs umbrella organisation. While some progress has been made, there is a need to develop sustainable systems and processes that improve teaching practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scallywaggs Graduation Kindergarten is located in Waipukurau. It is licensed to provide allday education and care for up to 24 children aged over two. At approximately four and a half years of age, the majority of children transition into the centre from the Scallywaggs Senior Kindergarten, a separately licensed service located on the same premises.</p><p>The centre is governed and managed by a general manager and operations manager who work collaboratively to promote the service's vision. Several staff changes have occurred over the past few months, including the recent appointment of a new head teacher.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's values and intended learning outcomes for children are not clearly reflected through the philosophy. The recently reviewed vision and philosophy statement expresses a belief in fostering children's cultures, current needs, strengths and interests while nurturing their early literacy and numeracy skills. Strengthening this to better reflect the service's values and learning outcomes for children is a priority.</p><p>There is a culture of respectful practice between children and teachers where children are supported to develop their social skills. They engage in sustained play and lead their own learning. Literacy and numeracy are woven throughout the programme. A bicultural programme is beginning to develop.</p><p>Children's profile books capture their emerging interests, skills and development. <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum is evident. Parent aspirations are actively sought and valued. Teachers should consider how these can be better reflected in the learning stories and show how they contribute to children's ongoing learning.¬†</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation need strengthening. Teachers have developed a new system for recording weekly activities. There now needs to be a shift from noticing and responding to children's interests and needs, to identifying their significant learning and strategies that promote their progress. This should assist teachers in evaluating the effectiveness of their teaching.</p><p>Developing a shared understanding of MƒÅori success as MƒÅori is a priority. Leaders have identified that building partnerships with whƒÅnau is essential in supporting this. Including children's language, culture and identity in assessment of learning is a next step.</p><p>Diverse learners are well supported to experience positive learning outcomes. An inclusive environment is evident. Children requiring additional learning support are identified by teachers who work in collaboration with parents, whƒÅnau and appropriate agencies when necessary.</p><p>Children's transitions into the centre and onto school are well considered. Reciprocal relationships with local schools are a continued focus.</p><p>The newly appointed head teacher leads the teaching team and is well supported by the operations manager. A recently implemented appraisal process is in place. Its intent is to support the professional growth of leaders and teachers and the impact they have on outcomes for children.</p><p>Implementing internal evaluation for improvement is required to effectively inform decision making. The recently devised strategic and annual plans are intended to guide centre operations. Strategic goals are focused on identified areas for improvement. Closely monitoring progress towards these goals is essential to achieving strategic change.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A number of systems within the centre are very new. Further improvement is needed before reliable judgements can be made about their impact on children's learning outcomes. Priorities for this service are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify the vision and philosophy to reflect the service's values and learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a clear process of internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support understanding of te ao MƒÅori and implementation of a bicultural curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scallywaggs Graduation Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scallywaggs Graduation Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>30 June 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
