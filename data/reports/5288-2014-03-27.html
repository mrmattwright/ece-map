</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Camberley Kindergarten is located in Camberley, Hastings. It provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. It is licensed for up to 40 children and operates for six hours, five days a week. Children come from a range of backgrounds and for some families, English is an additional language.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified. The programme is further enhanced through a Pacific support person who acts as a liaison and cultural guide for teachers and families. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>Relationships are warm and welcoming and partnerships with families are valued. Environmentally sustainable practices are promoted and form part of the regular programme. Children and families display a sense of belonging in the kindergarten setting.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two Education Managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage for sustained periods of time in a child-centred, play-based programme. They confidently make choices about who they wish to play with and where. Tuakana teina interactions among children are promoted by teachers to support learning. Routines are well established and provide a framework for the day, giving all children a sense of security in being able to predict what will happen next. Excursions into the local community extend the programme.</p><p>Teachers know children well within the context of their family. They work with families to transition the child into the kindergarten. A range of appropriate strategies are used to support the transition to school process. Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers liaise with external agencies where appropriate.</p><p>Learning spaces are thoughtfully presented and encourage exploration and investigation. Children have very good opportunities to be physically active in a spacious outdoor area. Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and support children as they engage in self-directed play.</p><p>These interactions should be strengthened further through more intentional use of strategies by teachers that extend and challenge children in their learning.</p><p>A recently developed philosophy is available to guide the operation of the kindergarten. To strengthen its implementation the teaching team should collectively determine and record indicators of what best practice looks likes for the curriculum.</p><p>Appropriate use of tikanga MƒÅori is woven through the curriculum and some teachers use te¬†reo¬†MƒÅori. A next step is for teachers to continue to develop their confidence and competence in the integrated use of te reo MƒÅori. Success for MƒÅori and Pacific families should be further enhanced through consulting with parents about cultural aspirations they may have for their child.</p><p>Portfolios are well presented. They highlight children‚Äôs engagement in the programme, individual interests, developing social relationships and at times dispositional learning. Assessment practices should be strengthened further through regularly revisiting and reflecting parents' aspirations. Teachers should consider their role in adding depth and complexity to children‚Äôs learning and how they can more consistently highlight progress over time.</p><p>Spontaneous review is used to reflect on aspects of the programme and make ongoing improvements. In order to strengthen self review and evaluation teachers should develop a clearer understanding of the process and build their evaluative capacity.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear long term direction for the association. Teachers are well supported through regular visits from the education managers who provide support and guidance and access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>There is a commitment by the association to increase teachers‚Äô capabilities in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori through the introduction of the Haere Whakamua project. This project is based around progressing the organisation‚Äôs journey in becoming bicultural.</p><p>The association identifies and ERO agrees that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>updating the appraisal process and policy</li>
<li>providing clear expectations through guiding documents for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, and monitoring their implementation.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers and use this information to inform future decision making.</p><h3><span>Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that they should continue to improve:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the use of intentional teaching strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best practice relating to the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice and strategies to support success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori and success for Pacific as Pacific</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>establish and review current guiding documents and monitor implementation</li>
<li>build and strengthen strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Camberley Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Camberley Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
