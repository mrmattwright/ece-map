ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE Mt Maunganui Q1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Mt Maunganui Q1.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>PORSE Mt. Maunganui Q1 is a network of home-based care and education that caters for children and families from the Mt Maunganui and Te Puke areas. The service currently has 31 educators who provide for up to four children at a time. The placing of every child is determined after discussions between each parent, home educator and PORSE personnel. This allows each child and family to have their education and care needs addressed in their own, or educators, home. ERO reviewers visited a sample of educators&rsquo; homes chosen by PORSE.</p><p>The following comments about aspects of the quality of education and care are based on ERO&rsquo;s observations in the homes of three educators and discussions with staff, coaches, programme tutors and educators. In addition, information about the service was gathered from parents and educators through a written survey.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Relationships: A feature of the service is the positive and respectful relationships established between educators and children. Positive interactions within homes enhance children&rsquo;s social and communication skills. Children confidently approach educators who are highly responsive to their interests and needs. The small group size supports children to develop friendships and work cooperatively with others. Children&rsquo;s learning benefits from the strong emphasis placed on fostering their emotional wellbeing and sense of belonging.</p><p>Leadership and management: Professional leadership and a cohesive team approach contribute to the quality of education and care provided for children and their families. A wide range of guidelines, policies and procedures set clear expectations, guide the management of the service, and provide educators with well-documented expectations. The network programme tutors visit educators regularly and provide them with sound professional advice, guidance and support. They model effective teaching strategies to engage children in learning. Educators have access to a wide range of workshops and training in current early childhood practice with an emphasis on understanding how young babies learn. Programme tutors ensure that children experience a safe and secure learning environment.</p><p>Learning programme: Educators prepare their family home to enable children to actively explore a wide range of stimulating learning experiences both indoors and outdoors. Children&rsquo;s involvement in the day-to-day household routines and spontaneous outings supports them to develop as capable, confident and competent learners. Considerable thought is given to providing a programme that positively contributes to the social and academic development of babies.</p><p>Authentic learning: The organisation is committed to providing children with a rich range of learning experiences within the wider community. Children and educators can participate in playgroups and regular excursions to places of interest. Many children access additional early childhood education services and have regular outings to parks, beaches, libraries, shops and visits to other educators&rsquo; homes. This approach supports children&rsquo;s engagement by providing an abundant range of learning opportunities.</p><p>Partnership with families: Educators, PORSE personnel and families have established open and trusting partnerships that are focused on providing the best outcomes for children. Families are kept well informed of events and activities through journals, newsletters and the services web-site. Educators talk regularly with parents, discussing progress and sharing relevant information. Children benefit from this holistic approach to their care and education.</p><h3>Agreed area for development and review</h3><p>Bicultural perspectives: Management and programme tutors have identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to encourage and promote the integration of M&#257;ori into programmes. The professional development planned for 2011 should enable programme tutors and educators to further promote and develop children&rsquo;s understanding of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.te reo me ng&auml; tikanga</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><p>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</p><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children; and</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Area of strength</h3><p>There are close relationships between parents, wh&#257;nau and educators. Each educator is dealing with only two to four families. Regular contact keeps families and educators informed about developments, emerging contexts and aspirations. Parents are able to select the educator who they perceive to be best equipped to meet the aspirations and particular requirements for their children.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE Mt Maunganui Q1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>14 March 2011</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><p>14 March 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-porse-mt-maunganui-q1" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of PORSE Mt Maunganui Q1</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on PORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support and Extend) Mt Maunganui Q1.</p><p>PORSE Mt Maunganui Q1 is a network of home-based care and education centres that caters for children and families from the Mt Maunganui and Te Puke areas. The service has 31 educators who each provide care and education for up to four children at a time.</p><p>A feature of the service is the affirming and respectful relationships established between educators and children. Positive interactions within homes enhance children&rsquo;s social and communication skills. Children confidently approach educators who are highly responsive to their interests and care needs.</p><p>The network programme tutors make regular home visits to educators and provide sound professional advice, guidance and support. They model effective teaching strategies to engage children in learning.</p><p>The organisation is committed to providing rich learning experiences that use the wider community. Children and educators benefit from an abundant range of learning opportunities that include playgroups and regular excursions to places of interest such as parks, beaches, libraries, shops and visits to other educators&rsquo; homes.</p><p>Families are kept well informed of events and activities through journals, newsletters and the service&rsquo;s web-site. Educators talk regularly with parents discussing progress and sharing relevant information. Children benefit from this holistic approach to their care and education.</p><p>Centre staff have identified that there is a need to encourage and promote the integration of bicultural perspectives into daily programmes. Professional development planned for 2011 should enable programme tutors and educators to better promote and develop children&rsquo;s understanding of the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
