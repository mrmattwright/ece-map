</table><p>Kiwi Kidz Community Early Education Centre¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Kidz Community Early Education Centre is located in Hastings. It is a community-based early learning service licensed for 22 children including five children up to two years of age. Of the 23 children on the current roll, 17 are MƒÅori.</p><p>The service operates as a charitable trust and is governed by a board made up of parents, the centre manager, financial administrator and a staff representative.</p><p>Since the July 2017 ERO report, a new centre manager and teacher have been appointed. The majority of the teaching team have been long serving.</p><p>The centre has received targeted support through a Ministry of Education programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). The centre has made some progress in addressing the areas identified in the previous ERO report and is continuing to strengthen these.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre priorities emphasise the importance of manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Links between whƒÅnau, home and centre support children's sense of belonging and consistency of children's care.</p><p>Children participate in a programme that supports their exploration and investigation. Infants and toddlers are well cared for by responsive teachers. The mixed-age setting fosters secure attachments with teachers and provides opportunities for learning and play through tuakana teina relationships. A sense of ƒÅko is evident as parents and whƒÅnau and teachers work together to support children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Individual learning plans have been developed to support teachers to more deliberately plan to extend children's interests, needs, strengths and learning over time. Teachers have identified that continuing to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning is a next step. ERO‚Äôs evaluation affirms this development. This should include reviewing the guidelines for teachers that promote consistent practice across the teaching team, with particular attention to reflecting children's language, culture and identity.</p><p>Bicultural practice is interwoven into aspects of the programme. Children are learning about te ao MƒÅori. Some are beginning to use te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Samoan children's language and culture is well reflected within the centre. Children are building a strong sense of identity.</p><p>Teachers are working collegially to address the key next steps in the previous ERO report. The new centre manager is supporting teachers and trustees to respond to these areas. New initiatives have been implemented. Teachers have developed learning priorities for children, reviewed the centre philosophy and seek whƒÅnau aspirations as partners in their child's learning. The centre manager recognises the need to further develop, then embed these processes to better promote consistency of practice and sustainability over time. ERO‚Äôs evaluation confirms this.</p><p>Teacher's knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation is at the early stages. Evidence of reflection is evident. A full cycle of review is yet to be completed.</p><p>Sound procedures and expectations for appraising teachers have been developed. These are yet to be implemented. This was an area to address in ERO‚Äôs 2017 evaluation, and is a priority to support teachers‚Äô growth and to meet the requirements of the Teaching Council.</p><p>The board is strengthening their knowledge and understanding of governance roles and responsibilities. A sound framework of policies and procedures support ongoing operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing appraisal to support teacher and leader development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for improved learner outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems and processes to promote ongoing sustainability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Kidz Community Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified the following area of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration and health and safety. To meet requirements Kiwi Kidz Early Education Centre needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appraisal implementation</p>
</li>
<li>the emergency plan must be reviewed annually. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7; HS7]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve compliance practice, the early childhood service should also ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>records are kept of vehicle's Warrant of Fitness and driver licence checks</p>
</li>
<li>there are suitable process in place for storing of records and information related to board in-committee business. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS18, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>14 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
