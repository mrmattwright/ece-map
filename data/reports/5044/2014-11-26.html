</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onehunga Kindergarten is well established on extensive grounds in Onehunga, Auckland. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children from two to five years old. The kindergarten has recently moved to a kindergarten day model and session hours now match those of schools. The community is culturally diverse.</p><p>Onehunga Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) provides management and curriculum support for teachers. The teaching team currently consists of three fulltime qualified teachers, one of whom holds the role of head teacher, and a relief teacher. A fourth teacher is to be employed to complete the team.</p><p>The philosophy has a focus on inclusion, honours partnerships with parents, and places value on children‚Äôs contributions to the programme. It also recognises them importance of diversity, individuality, and supporting children to become lifelong learners. Teachers promote environmental sustainability to raise children‚Äôs awareness of relevant issues.</p><p>Onehunga Kindergarten, previously named Onehunga Cuthbert Kindergarten, has a history of positive ERO reviews. The team has focused on addressing recommendations of the 2011 ERO report. This included continuing to refine self-review and planning processes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed and well supported by the teaching team to settle into their play. The well-resourced centre is thoughtfully laid out. The outdoor area has been improved. The centre offers many opportunities for children to be physically active, participate in large group activities or retreat to smaller, quieter spaces for play and exploration.</p><p>Children‚Äôs diverse cultural backgrounds are well represented in the kindergarten environment. Children have a sense of belonging in the centre. They confidently choose equipment, resources and the experiences they will participate in. They engage their teachers in conversation and seek support where needed. Strong friendships are evident amongst the children.</p><p>Very good parent support for the kindergarten is apparent. Parents participate in presenting the programme. They also record stories from home in the children‚Äôs portfolios. An active parent committee undertakes fund-raising and organises social occasions in the kindergarten. Friendly and respectful relationships between the teaching team and parents support children‚Äôs wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers are highly supportive of children‚Äôs individuality. They value what each child contributes to the life of the centre. Children have many opportunities to share their knowledge, skills, ideas and creativity and take leadership roles. Each child‚Äôs progress in learning and discovery is captured in beautifully presented portfolios. These include learning stories written by the teacher and child working together. Children understand that their work is valued by their teachers.</p><p>The programme incorporates many opportunities for children to learn about concepts of literacy, numeracy, science and the natural world. They are actively encouraged to explore in the natural world. Children present their discoveries through story, drama and the visual arts. Computer technologies are well integrated into the learning programme. The team is also trialling the introduction of an electronic programme for communication with parents.</p><p>Teachers use effective models of reflection and self review. This helps them to constantly refine their practice and sustain high quality provision for children. Fostering success for MƒÅori and Pacific children is an important feature of kindergarten teaching. Teachers affirm children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to provide strong governance for kindergartens. Positive strategies include effective professional learning and development that is responsive to strengthening teachers‚Äô professional skills, knowledge and practice. Distributed leadership among kindergarten teaching teams is also promoted. The sharing of knowledge and expertise within the Association is encouraged. Association leaders are currently reviewing the appraisal process and continue to explore appropriate ways to support teachers and ensure high quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team have identified appropriate priorities including:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the involvement of children in setting goals for their learning and supporting them to develop the skills that will enable them to evaluate their own work</li>
<li>promoting the value of children‚Äôs learning in the kindergarten within the local community, and particularly in the schools children will attend.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onehunga Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onehunga Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>26 November 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
