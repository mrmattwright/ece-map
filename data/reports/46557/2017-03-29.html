</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Woodville Early Childhood Centre opened in late 2015. It offers all-day education and care for up to 25 children, including five aged up to two years. The centre's routines promote interaction between age groups. There are designated indoor and outdoor play spaces for infants and toddlers. The philosophy emphasises the importance of whanaungatanga, whakamana and manaakitanga.</p><p>The centre is owned by the manager, who oversees the day-to-day running of the centre as well as curriculum implementation, with support from a head teacher. Teaching staff are qualified and registered. Children attending come from a diverse range of ethnic groups. Nine children identify as Māori.</p><p>This is Woodville Early Childhood Centre's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a programme of learning that reflects and celebrates their developing interests, strengths and abilities. They are able to make independent choices about their play and enjoy interactions with calm and supportive teachers. Routines are flexible to children and their families. Literacy and numeracy are often meaningfully integrated into the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers skilfully tailor their practice to respond to individual children as well as group and family contexts. A next step is to more clearly highlight children's progress. This should be the clear focus of assessment, planning and evaluation. An increased understanding of the nature and purpose of evaluation should add value to the planned programme and individual assessments.</p><p>Leaders and teachers prioritise relationships with families. The welcoming environment supports a sense of belonging and whanaungatanga, in line with the centre's philosophy. Input from whānau is welcomed and valued. A range of strategies are employed to engage with families and share useful information. This area of strength should now be extended to build learning partnerships with parents, through which their aspirations for their children's learning are regularly sought and planned for.</p><p>All children benefit from the centre's bicultural curriculum. They regularly see, hear and experience elements of te ao Māori.</p><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that a next step is to establish deliberate strategies to promote the educational success of tamariki Māori and tamaiti Pacific. Careful consideration should be given to gathering and responding to the cultural aspirations of whānau and 'aiga.</p><p>Teachers implement effective practices to support children's transition to school. A mutually beneficial relationship with the local school has been established, that includes regular liaison between leaders and teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy has recently been reviewed. A next step is for teachers to collaboratively unpack the statements within this philosophy to establish clear, shared understandings of teaching and learning priorities. These statements should then be used to support the evaluation of centre practice.</p><p>Self review occurs regularly, is appropriately child-focused, and results in improvement. A more evaluative approach should better support leaders and teachers to measure the effectiveness of centre practice and identify areas for development.</p><p>The manager successfully advocates for a strong focus on children and their wellbeing. Teachers are regularly challenged to reflect on and improve their practice. This culture of professional critique is further supported through robust appraisal and registration guidance systems. It is now necessary for the manager to more actively engage in a clearly documented appraisal process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that to improve outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation should be strengthened to clearly show children's progress over time, and reflect whānau aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers should implement and evaluate deliberate strategies to promote the educational success of Māori children and those from Pacific nations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation should be strengthened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the manager's appraisal documentation should align with centre policy. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Woodville Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Woodville Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>29 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
