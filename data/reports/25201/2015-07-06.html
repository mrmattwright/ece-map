</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Drury Playcentre is an established parent cooperative that serves a semi-rural suburb. It is located next to Drury School. It operates under the auspices of the Counties Playcentre Association, which provides Playcentre training, policies and procedures, and support from association personnel. Each playcentre contributes to the make-up of the Association and has representatives at association level.</p><p>At present, Drury Playcentre is experiencing a period of change after a significant number of more experienced members finished their time at playcentre. While membership of the centre is building, new members require nurturing to engage with playcentre training. The few remaining experienced members are managing the bulk of the responsibility for the smooth day-to-day operation of the centre, with support from paid educators employed by the Association.</p><p>Centre members provide education and care for children from birth to school age on three mornings a week in a mixed age group. Children and their parents/whƒÅnau are encouraged to attend regularly. At present 22 children are enrolled to attend sessions.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted the settled enjoyment children were taking in their play and the warm, welcoming atmosphere created by members. The report highlighted self review and planning processes as areas for improvement. ERO also recommended a stronger focus on building bicultural understanding. These next steps remain a priority for the centre.</p><p>The national playcentre organisation is currently undertaking a restructure which is likely to change the current structure of the Counties Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, engaged in self chosen play and friendly. They are eager to access the wide range of activities and experiences provided for them. They play well, talking together and sharing their ideas. Most children are comfortable with adults. They seek assistance from adults and respond to interactions with them.</p><p>Current members have welcomed a number of new families since the beginning of the year. New centre members are becoming aware of the shared nature of Playcentre responsibilities and expectations and are becoming willing to contribute. Some have enrolled in Playcentre training and are beginning to feel confident about sharing their thinking. This is a positive aspect of the centre‚Äôs redevelopment. Good leadership by long-standing members is a feature of the centre‚Äôs growth.</p><p>Centre members have established processes for assessment, planning and evaluation of learning programmes. It would now be useful for them to review these processes to create opportunities for newer members to take a more active role in noticing, recognising and responding to children‚Äôs learning. Linking the three processes in the planning cycle would also allow centre members to document the learning outcomes for each child and to plan to support their development over time.</p><p>Centre members have taken some appropriate steps to increase the focus on bicultural learning in the centre. All members are learning waiata, and words in te reo MƒÅori. The Association‚Äôs bicultural group has visited the centre to give support. Centre members should continue to build on this sound commitment to reflecting the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Centre members could consider establishing contact with Drury School as a first step in learning more about bicultural support for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre's outdoor environment provides interesting spaces and physical challenge for children. The indoor area provides areas of play and storage for a large range of resources and materials. Centre members should review the extent to which the arrangement of inside areas of play provides children with prompts and space to extend their play. Providing attractive and interesting places to explore should help children to sustain and develop their play. It is also important to make adequate provision for infants and toddlers in the programme environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>welcome and support new families, helping them to recognise the value of children extending their own learning</li>
<li>strengthen review processes to guide changes and identify effective teaching and learning</li>
<li>focus on increasing a sense of ownership and belonging of children and families/whƒÅnau in the centre</li>
<li>increase centre members' understanding of bicultural practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Drury Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The Association should establish robust quality assurance systems and training for Association personnel, in order to improve the effectiveness of support provided for centres.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Drury Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
