</table><p>Ranui Free Kindergarten (Timaru)¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ranui Free Kindergarten (Timaru) provides early childhood education for children from two years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children. Most children attend from 8.30am to 2.30pm.</p><p>The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by three qualified early childhood teachers and a support person. The teachers and head teacher began their roles during the last year. The kindergarten is beside the local school. It is a member of the North Timaru KƒÅhui Ako |Community of Learning.</p><p>The kindergarten's vision is that 'every child is a treasure to be nurtured, grow and flourish'. Its philosophy is built around the words: People (trusting, caring and supportive relationships, valuing each culture), Places (a sense of turangawaewae - belonging, care for the environment, and links with the local community,) and Things (children being responsible for their choices, actions and things).</p><p>Ongoing changes in staff have impacted on the kindergarten's progress against the next steps in the 2014 ERO report. Some recommendations remained as areas to further improve. However, good progress is now evident.</p><p>Ranui Free Kindergarten is one of 12 kindergartens administered by South Canterbury Kindergartens (SCK). A general manager oversees the association, under the governance of a board. Senior teachers provide ongoing professional advice and guidance to each kindergarten on teaching and learning.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There are welcoming, respectful and supportive relationships with children and whƒÅnau. The new teaching team is building trusting and caring relationships. Manaakitanga is very evident.</p><p>The children are settled, well engaged and show a good sense of belonging. They confidently access kindergarten resources and interact with their teachers. Children know the centre routines and expectations. They are encouraged and supported to take responsibility, make wise choices and relate well with others.</p><p>Children are very well supported in their learning and wellbeing. Teachers intentionally extend children's oral language, thinking and foster their curiosity. For children with additional learning needs and children who are transitioning into kindergarten or on to school, teachers work closely with parents to find ways to best support their child.</p><p>Te reo and te ao MƒÅori are increasingly valued in the kindergarten. Important MƒÅori concepts of tuakana-teina, manaakitanga, ako and whanaungatanga are evident in relationships and the programme. MƒÅori tikanga practices are respected. This is an area to further strengthen.</p><p>Children benefit from engaging and well-planned group programmes. These reflect the kindergarten's curriculum priorities and children's interests. Group plans include clear learning outcomes and specific strategies to achieve these. In the day-to-day programme, there is a good balance between child-initiated learning and teacher provocation.</p><p>The teaching team is collaborative and committed to providing the best for children and their families. Teachers are evaluative in their thinking and continue to adapt and refine how they provide for the children. They have developed useful action plans to drive improvements.</p><p>Through a period of change, this kindergarten was very well supported by the SCK. In response to parents' wishes, the SCK has applied to extend the kindergarten licence to include children from birth.</p><p>The SCK board is well informed about how well each kindergarten is progressing and contributing to the strategic direction of the SCK. It is strongly focused on improving outcomes for all children, including taking deliberate action to support MƒÅori and Pacific children and children with diverse learning needs in the kindergartens. SCK leaders have developed strong networked relationships with community organisations to support children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>There are effective systems and processes to ensure that regulatory requirements are met within each kindergarten. Relevant professional learning, improved appraisal processes and effective ongoing coaching and mentoring by the senior teachers are building teacher capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the teaching team agree, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to embed and refine recent changes and improved practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation for individual children (making the learning partnership with whƒÅnau, the role teachers play in supporting children's learning, children's cultures and their progress more visible in learning records)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the integration of te reo and te ao MƒÅori into the daily programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ranui Free Kindergarten (Timaru) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>14 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
