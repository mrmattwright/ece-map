</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Yendarra Kindergarten serves a multicultural community in Otara, Auckland. The Kindergarten Day Model of six hour days is provided. Up to 30 children from two to five years of age can attend daily. The physical environment provides children with a wide range of choices, and celebrates children‚Äôs cultures and interests.</p><p>The kindergarten team has three registered teachers, including the head teacher, two support staff, and an administrator. Staff have well-established relationships with families and the community. They are developing connections with the NgƒÅi Tai kaumatua and with leaders from Pacific communities.</p><p>Teachers are proactively working to increase levels of attendance by developing clearer communication processes with whƒÅnau at the time of enrolment. Their intention is to help whƒÅnau understand the importance of early childhood education as a foundation for children‚Äôs life-long learning. Good use of Ministry of Education Equity Funding and successful applications for community grants are supporting children‚Äôs attendance and engagement in the kindergarten programmes.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2012 report highlighted positive features, including welcoming and inclusive relationships and children who were capably engaged in the programme. These positive features continue to be evident. The report also recommended that teachers could increase opportunities for literacy and numeracy learning, and extend children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills. Teachers have responded positively to these areas for development by engaging in professional development.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides considered leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers.</p><p>After extensive review, consultation and development, the AKA has recently launched a new 10-year strategic direction. Its four strategic pillars or objectives relate to educational excellence, core organisational processes, community engagement and a future focus. These objectives are intended to guide the AKA and its kindergartens in their ongoing development. The AKA‚Äôs approach to rolling out a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New AKA roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergarten operations, curriculum and development. Professional development is planned to support kindergarten head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being developed to monitor quality in kindergartens and contribute to self review and ongoing improvement.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of ten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The learning programme has a special sense of wairua and respect for the mana of children and their whƒÅnau. It promotes children‚Äôs sense of cultural belonging and identity. Children and their whƒÅnau are greeted in their home languages. A strong foundation is provided for MƒÅori and Pacific children to experience regular reinforcement as competent and capable learners.</p><p>Children actively plan for their own learning and assess the progress they make. They select freely from a wide variety of high quality resources in thoughtfully presented play areas. Children work alongside teachers, identify topics that they want to learn more about, and use computer tools and resource books to gather in-depth information of interest.</p><p>Teachers respect children‚Äôs capability and independence. They listen to children and extend conversations to promote children‚Äôs language development and thinking skills. A big focus has been on supporting English language learning for children with other home languages.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and natural science learning are included well in the programme. A major focus has been on gardening and healthy eating. The programme and environment are being modified to cater for the learning needs and attributes of younger as well as older children.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs environment reflects teachers‚Äô commitment to bicultural practice. The history and tupuna of mana whenua are featured along with many other resources and taonga. The kindergarten has a strong sense of identity as part of the NgƒÅi Tai rohe. These positive practices provide a welcoming environment for MƒÅori whƒÅnau and help all children to become familiar with the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Effective planning, assessment and evaluation processes support and extend individual children‚Äôs interests. Teachers value and respond to children‚Äôs ideas, which are recorded in attractively presented assessment portfolios and curriculum programme displays. Portfolios provide good evidence of children‚Äôs individual progression of learning over time.</p><p>Teachers maintain close partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau, helping them to support their children‚Äôs learning. Parents talk about their aspirations for their children‚Äôs education and about their children‚Äôs learning experiences beyond the kindergarten. This information is used to extend children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Well-considered processes support children‚Äôs transitions into the kindergarten and then on to school. Staff are working together with the adjoining primary school to support transitions and encourage early childhood attendance.</p><p>Teachers continually reflect on the impact of their teaching on improving outcomes for children. The AKA is supporting the head teacher in her role to make operational tasks and responsibilities more manageable. Further sharing of tasks would be useful in building the professional skills and capacity of the teaching team.</p><p>AKA systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. A variety of useful systems and processes contribute to the teaching team‚Äôs increasingly robust self review. This self review is both responsive and planned, is supported by research into best practice, and reflects teachers‚Äô focus on continual professional development. It often results in improvements. It is timely now for teachers to raise the level of critique of their teaching practice, and more specifically identify outcomes for children as part of their self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and ERO agree that next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining self-review processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership capacity in the teaching team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening appraisal processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Yendarra Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Yendarra Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
