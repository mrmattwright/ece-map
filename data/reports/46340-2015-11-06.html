</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Our Place Educare has operated as a casual education and care service in Botany Town Centre since December 2013. The centre provides three two-hour sessions every day for up to 30 preschool children, including a maximum of 15 babies and toddlers, at each session. While the centre was primarily established to cater for casual attendance, many children attend regularly and often several times each week. The short sessions provide an effective stepping stone for children to move on to more formal early childhood settings as they get older.</p><p>The centre owner has deliberately staffed the centre with a multicultural team of qualified teachers who reflect the diversity of families using the service. The owner engages in ongoing professional development with staff and maintains supportive relationships with families, many of whom are still learning to speak English.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy embraces <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and honours the Treaty of Waitangi. The owner and teachers intend that children will “believe in themselves as capable learners”.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children arrive at the centre with an eagerness to explore. They have caring relationships with teachers who warmly welcome them into the centre. Although children generally settle quickly, parents’ are encouraged to stay and support them while they find something of interest. Children are busy, often independent explorers who make choices about their play. They benefit from teachers’ knowledge and personal understanding of their languages and cultures, and respond well to adults’ interest in their play. In this environment children are happy and have a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers support children's learning well. They work closely with small groups encouraging them to investigate resources at their own pace, or to participate in prepared activities. Teachers talk to children about their play, often using their home languages to supplement conversations as children begin to learn English. Teachers also integrate te reo Māori in the programme and help children to learn waiata and karakia. Teachers value parents’ knowledge and work collaboratively with them to address their aspirations for children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes to reflect the interests of children who attend regularly and to develop topics that support children's wellbeing and development. They include a focus on infants and toddlers in their planning, but remain flexible enough to respond to the changing groups throughout the day. Teachers regularly evaluate the programme and display a daily activity sheet to provide information for families. Teachers also keep assessment portfolios for children who attend at least three sessions a week. These records document children's experiences well, but teachers also recognise they could make further improvements to strengthen their analysis of learning and to further promote children's language, diversity and culture.</p><p>The centre is an attractive, well resourced environment. The careful design makes good use of space and pays attention to children's safety, privacy and wellbeing. A challenging arrangement of equipment for physically active play compensates well for the lack of an outdoor area. Children also have good access to creative and tactile materials, manipulative resources, books and imaginative play items. Displays celebrate children’s learning and their diverse ethnic origins. A wall of greetings in families’ home languages creates an inviting entrance to the centre.</p><p>The owner is an inclusive and humble leader who has established a stable and cohesive teaching team. She supports teachers’ professional learning with a meaningful appraisal process and trusts them to share responsibilities for operating the centre. The centre has a generally sound policy framework and systems to support positive outcomes for children. However, the owner could benefit from the support of a management committee with staff and parent representatives to help with long-term development, decision making and ongoing self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and teachers agree the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>revising the strategic plan to more specifically identify long-term goals with annual plans to guide the achievement of these goals</li>
<li>reviewing programme planning and evaluation to strengthen the focus on teaching strategies for integrating key curriculum areas</li>
<li>further developing self-review processes with a particular focus on identifying ways to support learners with a diverse range of home languages.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Our Place Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Our Place Educare will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
