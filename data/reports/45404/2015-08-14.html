</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clevedon Kidz Get Set 4 School Centre provides full day education and care for children from three and a half years old to school age. It operates in conjunction with the nearby Clevedon Kidz Early Childhood Centre for younger children. The service is licensed for 30 children. It is founded on Christian principles and a philosophy that embraces biculturalism and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Clevedon Presbyterian Church. An administration manager works closely with the centre supervisor to oversee the operation of both centres. Team leaders in the centres are responsible for guiding the curriculum and day-to-day administration. Clevedon Kidz caters for a largely PƒÅkehƒÅ/NZ European community, with very small numbers of MƒÅori, Pacific and Asian children. However, the teaching team who are all registered teachers celebrate diversity and encourage children to respect the languages and culture of others. Teachers maintain their ongoing professional development and continue to grow their own understanding of te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>In 2012 ERO endorsed many positive aspects of the service including the extent to which the centre philosophy was enacted, the support for children's learning and the quality of partnerships with parents and the community. These strengths continue to be features of the service. Centre leaders responded effectively to ERO‚Äôs suggestions for improvements to self-review documentation and the use of te reo MƒÅori in the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Caring and positive relationships underpin the welcoming centre environment. Children arrive eager to engage in play and connect with their friends. They are happy and confident in the centre and respond well to enthusiastic teachers who actively support their interests. Children enjoy working in collaborative groups, but are also confident to explore resources independently. They use digital tools purposefully and benefit from opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play. They are also becoming familiar with karakia, waiata and basic reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers model the values embedded in the centre‚Äôs philosophy and consistently support play. They engage children in genuine conversations about their interests and ask questions that prompt children to think and explore new ideas for play. Teachers encourage children to work cooperatively and show respect for each other and centre resources. They could now extend the challenges they provide for children when setting up the environment and when making choices about resources.</p><p>Programme planning is based on children's interests. Teachers have simplified their planning processes and made planning more accessible to parents. They identify resources and activities to support interests, often incorporating literacy and numeracy experiences. Teachers maintain records of children's play in attractive assessment portfolios. They use these records well to identify the dispositions children develop to enhance their learning. As teachers further refine their processes, they should consider ways to document their expectations for teaching and learning and more formally evaluate the quality of learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Parents value the centre. They appreciate the relationships they share with teachers and the opportunities provided for their children. Parents feel well informed about their children's learning and are able to contribute to decisions about the programme and centre development. Centre leaders are committed to providing well for their community and to being responsive to family aspirations and expectations.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Leaders prioritise the quality of outcomes for children and demonstrate a willingness to seek ongoing improvement in practices. They have developed an effective policy framework and management plans to guide the centre‚Äôs operation. Together with teachers, they have established self-review processes that support strategic development and ongoing reflection, and that are responsive to arising issues. Managers encourage teachers‚Äô ongoing professional development and deliberately provide opportunities for them to grow leadership capability.</p><p>Managers plan to revise their strategic planning with a more progressive model. This should help them respond to the potential growth of their community and their long-term intention to accommodate both Clevedon Kidz centres on the same site.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing development of programme planning to strengthen guidance for the teachers‚Äô roles in the programme</li>
<li>further reviewing the formal Get Set 4 School programme to more closely align teaching and learning with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> principles</li>
<li>streamline the appraisal process to better align teacher‚Äôs job descriptions with the registered teachers‚Äô criteria and strengthen the evidence of teachers‚Äô practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clevedon Kidz Get Set 4 School Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Clevedon Kidz Get Set 4 School Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
