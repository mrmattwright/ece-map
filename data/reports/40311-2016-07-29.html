</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Buckle My Shoe Early Learning Centre is a privately owned, family-oriented education and care service located in the Tauranga suburb of Gate Pa. It provides all day education and care for up to 25 children, including up to 5 under 2 years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 31 children were enrolled, including 3 of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers aim to provide an environment where children are acknowledged as active participants in their own learning and encouraged to become responsible and independent learners.</p><p>The owner is ably supported by three long-standing staff members and two new teachers have recently been appointed. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2013, the centre has responded positively to recommendations about the use of self-review outcomes to inform annual and strategic goals, and reviewing procedures and practices for children as they approach transition to school. The centre acknowledges there remains further work to do in strengthening teacher appraisal.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers at Buckle My Shoe know children and their families well and there is a strong sense of belonging for children, teachers and parents. Caring, respectful and inclusive relationships promote children's wellbeing and learning across all aspects of centre practice.</p><p>The centre curriculum is continually evolving in response to children's interests, needs and dispositions. Through child and teacher-initiated play, teachers encourage independent and shared discovery and decision making, which is resulting in children developing skills to lead their own learning. Children are continually challenged through open-ended questions, involvement in problem solving opportunities, and encouragement to take considered risks. They engage in a range of sustained play activities, both by themselves and with others. Teachers work alongside children and portray themselves as learners also.</p><p>Children are able to access a wide range of opportunities in well-planned environments to play and explore across all learning domains. They independently use a wide range of appropriate resources and equipment, both indoors and outdoors. Children‚Äôs learning and creative work are attractively displayed, promoting their sense of belonging and pride in their learning. They also benefit from visits to nearby parks, community events, and areas of local significance.</p><p>The centre's current strategic focus is the outdoor environment. A new all-weather cover has been installed over the outdoor verandah allowing for more effective use of the outdoor space.</p><p>Teachers skilfully promote oral language development, particularly in building vocabulary and children's questioning skills. They effectively incorporate practices that enable children to engage in meaningful and interesting literacy and mathematics learning. Bicultural practices, including te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, are evident throughout the centre.</p><p>Children under 2 years of age enjoy opportunities to interact and build strong attachments with all teachers. They explore and make sense of the world around them as they experiment with movement, language, and a variety of resources. Teachers are flexible and respond to the rhythms of each child. Regular conversations with parents provide staff with vital information about children‚Äôs preferences and needs. Teachers also provide consistency and continuity for children in order to establish a secure foundation for their care and education.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, there has been ongoing development of self-review practices. Review of the under 2s‚Äô area has resulted in changes to staffing in both age-based areas. All staff are now involved with both groups and each teacher is responsible for a selected number of children across all ages. Self review has also resulted in changed teaching practices for preparing four year olds to transition to school. Teachers focus on children's holistic development, including self-care skills, to assist their transition. The centre is currently seeking feedback from schools to inform current transition to school practice.</p><p>The centre's vision and philosophy are highly visible in observed practice. Within the philosophy, there is a strong focus on virtues and the 'Growing Great Character' programme, designed with parental input. This is encouraging children's ongoing development of learning dispositions and virtues.</p><p>Children's individual portfolios and informal discussions with teachers keep parents well informed about what their children are interested in, know and can do. The portfolios include a range of activities, art work, teacher observations and learning stories. It would now be beneficial for the centre to review how to increase parent input in children's portfolios.</p><p>Comprehensive self review continues to be an integral part of centre practice and includes reflection, teacher professional discussion, parent feedback, and spontaneous and planned reviews. Teachers have a positive attitude to change and work collaboratively to develop strategies to improve outcomes for all children. They are responsive to parent input and professional readings, and incorporate adaptive and innovative practices as appropriate. Staff have participated in self review regarding recent legislative changes associated with vulnerable children, health and safety, and food. This has resulted in all staff being knowledgeable about the requirements and expectations.</p><p>The centre's vision, values and philosophy are informed by parental aspirations. Effective documentation of policies and procedures guides centre practice. The centre owner makes effective use of teachers' knowledge, skills and expertise. Individual strengths are recognised and teachers have opportunities to develop leadership skills in areas such as sustainability and bicultural practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre acknowledges that their current appraisal process must include annual appraisal of all of the Practicing Teacher Criteria (PTCs) in line with Education Council requirements. The process should also be strengthened with:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular, ongoing monitoring of personal goals related to teaching practice and improving outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formal observations of teaching practice, linked to the PTCs and personal goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Buckle My Shoe Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Buckle My Shoe Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>29 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
