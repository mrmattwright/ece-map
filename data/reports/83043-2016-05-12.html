</table><p>Systems to guide centre operations and practices need to be further developed and better monitored to ensure positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Flippers Early Childhood Centre is a small, family-owned centre on the premises of a Dunedin swimming pool. It provides full-day care and education for up to 27 children from birth to school age.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and the owner (who is also a qualified teacher) has made it a priority to have more teachers working with the children than are required. The owner has appointed two teachers to share the manager's role.</p><p>Since the February 2013 ERO report, both centre managers have taken extended periods of leave and the owner has been less involved in the day-to-day running of the centre. ERO found that many of the key next steps from the previous report remain areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have a well-developed philosophy that clearly states what they want children to learn at the centre. They have worked together to improve the quality of planning, assessment and evaluation. Group and individual plans show teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>know what learning they intend to support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek and respond to parents' wishes for their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and use relevant strategies and experiences to support learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To ensure these improvements are sustained, managers and teachers need to develop guidelines and expectations for planning, assessment and evaluation. They then need to use these as they monitor their effectiveness.</p><p>Children benefit from programmes that are interesting and varied. This includes learning:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>about sustainability and gardening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about healthy eating and physical activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>through many outings into the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>early mathematics and literacy skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skills to be independent and to relate well to others.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers develop close relationships with children and their families. They often seek older children's ideas about their learning. A weekly excursion to the nearby bush provides challenges and leadership opportunities for the group of children who are about to start school. Leaders need to act with urgency to strengthen the planning for this excursion so they can be assured of the safety of children when they are out of the centre environment.</p><p>Children are settled in the learning environment. Teachers work sensitively with children who need additional help with their learning. They effectively support the learning and wellbeing of infants and toddlers through caring, responsive relationships, and the range of learning experiences provided.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated into the programme. Children learn about MƒÅori legends and waiata, and learn about caring for the environment.</p><p>The leaders work well together. They and the teachers are thoughtful about their work with children. They undertake professional learning to improve their practice.</p><p>ERO found that systems and practices within the governance and management of the centre were not well developed or robust enough to guide the leaders and teachers in their work, or ensure the sustainability of good practices.</p><p>The strategic plan needs to more clearly identify key priorities for the centre. The owner and leaders need to develop planning to ensure these priorities are achieved. The strategic plan should be regularly monitored, evaluated and reported on.</p><p>There is a schedule to guide self review, but this has not been kept up in a timely way. Leaders and teachers need to further develop their understanding and use of self review.</p><p>Self review would be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>framing each review with an evaluative question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that indicators relate to the focus of the review, are clearly understood and used to evaluate the impact of any resulting improvements or changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being aligned to strategic priorities and the centre philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The managers have attended professional development to strengthen the appraisal process. The appraisal policy and accompanying guidelines should be reviewed and further developed to ensure that teachers know the expectations. The owner must ensure that both she and the managers are appraised appropriately.</p><p>The owner needs to provide more ongoing support for the managers. She agrees it is worth reinstating the previous good practices of regular meetings and ongoing mentoring of the managers. The managers' job descriptions should be updated and reflect the leadership roles required of them.</p><p>ERO found that systems for ensuring health and safety within and outside the centre could be more robust and better monitored. The owner and managers need to ensure they remain current with changes required as a result of changes to legislation. This includes what they will do to respond to the requirements of the Vulnerable Children's Act.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To provide better support for the managers, the owner needs to monitor how well the centre is promoting positive outcomes for children. The owners and managers need to improve:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-review practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems and guidelines for teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring of health and safety requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Flippers Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety, governance and management.</p><p>To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>risk analysis and management planning when on excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>administration of medicine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documentation of fire and earthquake drills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recording of ongoing analysis of hazards and accidents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accuracy of enrolment agreements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17, HS28, HS8, HS 12, GMA10]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Flippers Early Childhood Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>12 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
