</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville is located in the rural township of Morrinsville. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years. Currently there are 52 children enrolled with 12 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy places value on children learning through play using the framework of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. They aim to include Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles and reflect these in the programme. Teachers believe children should be empowered to drive their own learning and support them to develop their creativity, imagination and resilience.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2015, the experienced teaching team has remained consistent. The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history and since the 2015 ERO review they have further strengthened internal evaluation, and assessment practices.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the governance and management of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, a community not-for-profit organisation. The overarching philosophy of the organisation is to provide kindergartens where children learn through play and are supported to reach their potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families enjoy close, respectful and trusting relationships with teachers. Together teachers and children have fun as part of the learning process. Children have established friendships and regularly support each other in learning through tuakana teina relationships. A positive and inclusive kindergarten culture promotes a strong sense belonging and wellbeing for children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Teachers effectively develop children‚Äôs confidence and competence as lifelong learners. Children are encouraged to be creative, use their imagination and problem solve. Teachers use intentional strategies to support children to revisit ideas, deepen understanding and develop social competencies. They have a deep understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> dispositions and learning outcomes. Through their interests and play children engage in high levels of sustained and complex learning.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum is well designed and underpinned by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum. Literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas are well planned for within carefully designed areas of play. Some te reo MƒÅori is interwoven throughout the daily programme. Children learn through extra curriculum experiences provided by community people who participate in the weekly programme sharing their strengths with children and teachers. Children learn in meaningful and authentic contexts. Partnerships among teachers and families contributes positively to children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Assessment practices demonstrate children‚Äôs progress in a range of contexts and over time. Children's strengths are acknowledged and affirmed, and highlights their success in learning. Planning is responsive and informed by careful observation of children's interests and strengths. Children with additional learning needs receive individual education plans targeted specifically to support their wellbeing and learning. Children and their families often revisit individual assessment portfolios which provide a rich record of their achievement over time.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement for its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children‚Äôs learning, wellbeing and that of their whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Continue deepening assessment, planning and evaluation practices to include a stronger focus on including MƒÅori tamariki whakapapa, language, culture and identity in assessment practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville will be in three years.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p>14 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
