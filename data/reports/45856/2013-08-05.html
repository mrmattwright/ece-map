</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coatesville Learning Centre opened in February 2012 and is purpose built to serve a rural village community. This is the first ERO report for the centre. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 20 children under two years of age. Children are grouped according to age in two separate rooms. Outdoor playing spaces lead out from each of the rooms and have been purposely developed to create a natural environment. The centre provides both sessional and full day care.</p><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>The centre philosophy is strongly based on the principles and goals of, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. It clearly outlines aspirational goals to guide teachers‚Äô practices and relationships. Teachers have made a good start in consulting with parents to help ensure these goals are being well met in the programme. Teachers work well together, using a collaborative approach to leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and highly engaged in the learning programme. They make choices about their participation and enjoy the positive and caring relationships they share with teachers and other children. Teacher practices with children are thoughtful and affirming. Reciprocal conversations between teachers and children are meaningful and encourage children to share their ideas.</p><p>Communication between the centre and parents is frequent. Some parents regularly contribute family information to children‚Äôs portfolios which strengthens teacher knowledge of children‚Äôs home lives. Children enjoy revisiting their centre experiences through photographs and books created for them.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to choose from a wide range of high quality resources. Teachers effectively support children‚Äôs independent exploration and children often sustain their interest in activities for long periods of time. The centre environment is light, spacious, and provides children with access to a natural environment with equipment designed to stimulate and challenge their learning. Children are surrounded by animals and gardens that connect them to the centre‚Äôs rural setting.</p><p>Teachers are confident practitioners. Teamwork and recognition of strengths within the team adds to the quality of their professional practice. They are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and focus on prompting positive outcomes for children. Teachers continue to refine planning and assessment processes. The manager closely monitors assessment and supports teachers to embed new ways of working.</p><p>Teachers have made a good start to developing bicultural aspects in their practice, including te reo me nga tikanga MƒÅori. They have identified the need to continue the development of this aspect of their practice.</p><p>Management of the centre is thoughtful and efficient. Self-review processes help ensure that policies and procedures are current and that teaching practice is effective. Managers take deliberate steps to grow teacher capacity as leaders of learning. Teachers take collective responsibility for professional development, as identified through appraisal. The team culture of the centre is very conducive to continued improvement for the care and education of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the next step for the centre is to continue to strengthen strategic planning processes. This should provide a clearer framework for teachers to strengthen self-review processes and evaluate the effectiveness of programmes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coatesville Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coatesville Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
