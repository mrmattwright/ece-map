</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Castle Education and Care Centre is a privately owned service located in Dannevirke. The centre is licenced for 32 children, including 12 children up to the age of two. Of the 41 children enrolled, 20 identify as MƒÅori. Parents are offered a choice of sessional and full-day childcare.</p><p>The centre's philosophy recognises the importance of partnerships with family/whƒÅnau in the holistic growth and development of each child.</p><p>The centre has recently developed a natural bush and garden area that includes MƒÅori artefacts from the local area. An official ceremony celebrated the development of this space with members from local Iwi attending.</p><p>The owner/manager and head teacher provide governance, management and pedagogical leadership for a team of three qualified, registered teachers.</p><p>The July 2013 ERO evaluation findings identified the need to improve aspects of assessment, self review and appraisals for teachers. Limited progress has been made in addressing these areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is highly evident in practice.</p><p>A warm and welcoming environment supports children to settle quickly as they transition into and out of the daily sessions. Children have ample opportunity to participate in a wide choice of activities and resources. The environment supports children to problem solve, investigate and develop their physical skills.</p><p>Children's curiosity is nurtured and supported. They play cooperatively for sustained periods and their social competence and independence is promoted. There is space for non-mobile children to safely explore the environment.</p><p>Teachers know children's strengths, needs and abilities. Care routines are carefully managed to ensure consistency between home and the centre. Peaceful and respectful practice is modelled by staff and children.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are supported by teachers. Staff work in collaboration with parents and whƒÅnau and seek advice and guidance from appropriate agencies when necessary.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori is effectively woven throughout the programme. Children have opportunities to learn waiata, tikanga and their whakapapa.</p><p>A strategic goal for the service is to have a stronger focus on strengthening relationships with their whƒÅnau MƒÅori. Current professional development with the local iwi should improve the way teachers support and promote educational success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>Assessment and planning documentation requires strengthening to improve practice. Leaders acknowledge the need to continue to improve practice in this area, including revisiting individual children's learning to ensure that this is extended over time. Specific guidance through a clear policy should make clear the expectations of teachers. Leaders should monitor implementation and evaluate effectiveness. Profile books are attractive records of children's participation and enjoyment in the daily programme.</p><p>An annual appraisal cycle has not yet been established for the teaching team. This key next step was identified in the July 2013 ERO report and it has not yet been sufficiently addressed. Consideration should be given to defining the roles and responsibilities of service leaders to provide greater clarity about who is accountable for all areas of centre operation and providing targeted professional development to improve practice.</p><p>Self review continues to require strengthening. Developing a more rigorous process to guide understanding of review and internal evaluation are key next steps.</p><p>A recently developed annual plan guides centre activities. Children's emotional and physical wellbeing are promoted through regularly reviewed health and safety practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a curriculum policy or procedure to guide assessment, planning and evaluation to better inform planning and evaluation practices and monitor implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a rigorous annual appraisal system for leaders and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen self review and internal evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There has been limited progress made in addressing the key next steps identified in July 2013 ERO report, therefore a greater sense of urgency is now required to address these issues.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Since the onsite phase of the review ERO has requested an action plan from the governing authority that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates against the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Castle Education and Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management practices. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>implement a system of regular appraisal.<br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Castle Education and Care Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to¬†</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
