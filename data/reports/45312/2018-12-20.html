</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre, in the grounds of the Harbourside Church, provides for up to 69 children, many of whom come from the surrounding suburbs. Teachers provide programmes in four age-related rooms. There is also a separate space for four-year-old children.</p><p>The centre is governed by a charitable trust. A governance board oversees financial aspects of centre operations. Day-to-day management of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher. Most of the staff are qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre has a Christian based philosophy with a strong emphasis on family partnerships. Teachers recognise the value of supporting children to be confident learners and communicators.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded well to the ERO 2015 report. They have improved the quality of teacher appraisal and established long-term goals for children's education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engaged in the programme. They have a sense of belonging and develop friendships with each other. Children play cooperatively, making good use of the resources and experiences available. They transition through the centre based on their age and individual readiness. Teachers work appropriately with external agencies to support children with additional needs</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy nurturing care and benefit from good adult-to-child ratios. Toddlers are confident to explore and communicate with their teachers. Teachers nurture children's oral language, and their social and self-management skills. The outdoor environment offers further play and exploration for toddlers to develop their mobility and independence.</p><p>Teachers have responsive and caring relationships with children and provide a welcoming and attractive environment for families. Many photos of children are displayed. Children engage in activities that teachers provide. It is timely to focus the programme more on child-led play. A greater emphasis could be placed on children following their own ideas and strengths, with adults in a supportive role.</p><p>The programme aligns with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are continuing to develop their planning, assessment and evaluation processes. Consideration could now be given to how well the programme is supporting and challenging older children's learning through teachers' open-ended questioning and opportunities for problem solving and complex play.</p><p>Interviews with parents enable teachers to find out about their aspirations for their children's learning. Portfolios are an attractive record of children's activities and experiences in the centre. The development of digital portfolios provides opportunities for teachers to evaluate their assessment practices.</p><p>Teachers' commitment to bicultural practice is evident in the centre. They incorporate te reo MƒÅori in words, phrases and songs with the children. Displays promote and celebrate the cultures of all children. Some teachers speak with children from diverse cultural backgrounds in their home languages. These approaches support children's sense of identity and their language development.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by a sound framework of policies and procedures. Internal evaluation is beginning to contribute to improved learning outcomes for children. Leaders maintain a good relationship with, and receive good support from, the board. A strategic plan outlines long-term goals. Identifying timelines and persons responsible for actions would make planning and internal evaluation more effective.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree the next key steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing and refining the philosophy and curriculum in response to <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying ways to increase opportunities for challenge and complex play particularly for older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that internal evaluation is guided by robust evaluative questions and reasoning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>examining the effectiveness of teaching practices in promoting positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
