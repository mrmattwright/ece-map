</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Inglewood Community Childcare Centre Inc is located in Inglewood, near New Plymouth. The centre operates as a non-profit incorporated society and offers families all day education and care for 67 children, including 17 children up to two years of age. The high ratio of staff to children has a positive impact on their education and care.</p><p>The purpose-built centre caters for three age groups in specific areas. The centre manager has oversight of all three centres. Each age specific area is managed by a team leader. This leadership team works together to implement the strategic goals of the committee of elected parents. They also manage the daily running of the centre.</p><p>As identified in the April 2010 ERO report, teaching practice continues to effectively notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs learning. Relationships and interactions between adults, children and their peers remain positive and support high levels of engagement in learning and curriculum activities. Parent and whƒÅnau contributions are valued. Their views are evident in planning, and learning portfolios.</p><p>Staff continue to develop their understanding of purposeful self review. Involvement in centre wide professional learning and development has strengthened teachers' capability to determine relevant aspects for curriculum review and inform useful changes to practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Inglewood Community Childcare philosophy guides centre operation. Clear links from the philosophy to the strategic and annual plan support ongoing improvement.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have high levels of care and nurturing. Adults respond effectively to their individual needs. Teachers listen for and interpret their subtle cues. They recognise preferences and encourage their physical and emotional development. Useful links with home routines are included to meet individual needs.</p><p>Toddlers and young children engage purposefully in activities and experiences that reflect their emerging interests. Flexible routines suit the needs of children. Curriculum decisions are reflective of the centre's philosophy and based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> Numeracy and literacy concepts are appropriately included in child-initiated learning experiences. Wellbeing and social competency is supported. Children demonstrate satisfaction and enjoyment in learning experiences designed to suit their interests.</p><p>Teaching strategies effectively promote the emotional and social learning of children. Learning is well paced to suit individual needs. Children investigate, explore and consider the range of experiences offered to suit their interests. They are able to make choices, develop working theories and persevere with tasks.</p><p>Regular reflection about children‚Äôs learning by teachers supports their collective ability to respond meaningfully to individuals through teaching and design of the curriculum. Children‚Äôs interests and learning outcomes are reflected in narrative assessments and form the basis for planning. Teachers pose questions and work together in identifying how best to extend children‚Äôs thinking and respond to their learning.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are included in all aspects of centre life. Learning portfolios provide opportunities to set shared goals and comment on the progress of their child. High staff ratios enable educators to talk with parents when dropping off and picking up their child. The visual planning process enables parents to add comments about the daily learning experiences. Surveys for parents link to the centre's self review focus.</p><p>Teachers have designed the curriculum to acknowledge and purposefully include children's language and culture. MƒÅori symbols, contexts and natural resources are used as part of the learning environment. Children hear and are able to respond, through the purposeful inclusion of te reo MƒÅori. They engage in culturally relevant contexts for learning. Staff promote responsive practices that acknowledge MƒÅori learners and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The physical environment is well designed, enabling teachers to respond to children‚Äôs needs by providing a wide range of planned and spontaneous activities. Review and reflection by teachers have contributed to the provision of shared learning spaces for all ages and resources specific to the developing needs of children. Opportunities for children to play with others of similar age, and interact in mixed age groups, support development of their social competence and contribute to an inclusive environment.</p><p>Effective leadership promotes positive outcomes for children, parents and whƒÅnau. The philosophy is the basis for review and improvement. Centre leaders model agreed practice and engage teachers in professional discussion that strengthens what they do. Useful feedback and guidance in appraisal and regular reflection on planning and assessment outcomes supports success for children. Leaders match the strengths of teachers to the needs of children when considering centre organisation.</p><p>Self review contributes well to decision making. Strategic, planned and spontaneous reviews are aligned. Staff and parents work collaboratively. Review leads to continuous improvement in processes and practices that strengthen outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and ERO agree to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and share indicators and expectations for an effective curriculum, to be used as a basis for self review</li>
<li>further develop and sustain culturally responsive practices for MƒÅori learners by exploring <em>TƒÅtaiako - Cultural competencies for teachers of MƒÅori Learners .</em></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Inglewood Community Childcare Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Inglewood Community Childcare Centre Inc will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>30 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
