</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikanae Playcentre is one of 20 parent-led early childhood centres administered by the Wellington Playcentre Association (the association). A council oversees operation at governance level and an executive committee provides the adult education programme, guidance and support for members. Two centre supporters are employed by the executive to visit playcentres and provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. Parents share the duties associated with implementing the programme.</p><p>Playcentre philosophy recognises parents as the best first teachers of their children and emphasises the importance of child-initiated play in mixed-age sessions. Acknowledging Te Tiriti o Waitangi is an integral part of this philosophy.</p><p>Waikanae Playcentre members place high value on being part of a learning community where cooperative management and positive relationships support operation and children‚Äôs learning. Three mixed-age sessions are held each week. The majority of children attending the centre are aged over three years.</p><p>Since the November 2010 ERO report, this service has been relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. The licensing process was a focus for development for some time. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 20 reviews of centres in the Wellington Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Key philosophical values are reflected in practice. A real sense of family and community is evident. There is an ongoing focus on building and maintaining positive relationships. Members are friendly and welcoming. They express a commitment to supporting families from all backgrounds and ethnic groups to become part of playcentre. Exploring ways to promote this would be a suitable development step.</p><p>Members maintain good levels of purposeful engagement with children. They are responsive, allowing children to take the lead and supporting them to explore, extend their ideas and persevere in their play. Literacy is integrated into the programme in meaningful, playbased ways. Investigation of science and nature is a particular strength, with adults planning learning experiences to extend children‚Äôs understanding of new ideas.</p><p>Children‚Äôs language development is fostered by the ongoing opportunities for discussion and conversation. High ratios of adults to children promote opportunities for one-to-one interaction. Positive guidance is used well to support children‚Äôs social learning. Much sustained and cooperative play is evident. Children are settled and happy learners.</p><p>Children have free access to a suitable variety of high quality learning materials. These are well organised to promote children‚Äôs interests and opportunities for investigation. The outdoor environment provides a range of challenges to support children‚Äôs physical development, exploration and creativity.</p><p>Centre leaders, in consultation with the association, are committed to strengthening members‚Äô understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnership and establishing a more bicultural perspective in the centre. There is also interest in fostering links with the association‚Äôs MƒÅori whƒÅnau support group and local iwi to strengthen this approach.</p><p>Parents are keen to provide appropriate support for families making the transition from playcentre to school. They are considering enriching links with the various schools in the area. Developing their thinking further about suitable learning experiences to support the older children, and parent understanding, are also agreed next steps.</p><p>There is good provision for infants and toddlers. They are well supported and encouraged to explore play spaces and a full range of learning materials. Activities are carefully planned to invite their participation and developmental needs. A suitably resourced area is specifically designated for those children who are not yet mobile. Children aged up to three years show confidence in making choices and leading their learning.</p><p>The programme is strongly child led. Since the previous ERO report, members have continued to develop their approach to planning for learning. Session planning meetings enable parents to share aspirations for extending the interests and strengths of their children and to collaboratively develop the programme. All adults are expected to contribute to children‚Äôs learning records. There is a strong emphasis on identifying how children's learning links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Ongoing planning and evaluation of sessions could be improved to better identify and promote the learning of individuals. Refining assessment records so children‚Äôs progress in learning is more of a focus, is a suitable development step.</p><p>Adults take pride in being part of a learning community alongside their children. Collaborative practice is highly valued. A core group of committed parents provide strong leadership for operation and programme development. They are determined to secure a sustainable future for the centre. Members are well supported to become familiar with roles and expectations. Although they regularly reflect on their practice, understanding and use of formal self review is at an early stage.</p><p>The association provides good support and a range of training for members. The centre supporter provides regular and valued face-to-face feedback and aid as needed. A more structured and evaluative approach based on centre and association-identified priorities, and growing members‚Äô practice, should better promote and sustain improvement over time. Comprehensive and up-to-date written policies and procedures guide office holders in their management roles, and members in planning and implementing an appropriate programme. The association is both improvement and future focused. The systematic review and plan to restructure governance and management are being carefully worked through to support a more sustainable future for the organisation and individual centres.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>deepen their understanding of learners with diverse needs</li>
<li>implement a more bicultural perspective in the learning programme</li>
<li>strengthen their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>support members to strengthen their understanding and use of self review to promote improvement</li>
<li>continue to develop centre support processes in response to identified needs and priorities</li>
<li>support members to develop their understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnership</li>
<li>provide leadership to members to help them define their understanding of success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori</li>
<li>redevelop the appraisal process to ensure the development needs of centre-based employees working with children, are met.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the members and management of Waikanae Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waikanae Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>30 April 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
