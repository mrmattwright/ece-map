</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindy Tweenz is one of a group of four privately owned education and care services, located in the Queenwood suburb of Hamilton. The centre is licensed for up to 25 children aged from 3 to 5 years. At the time of this review the centre roll was 66 including five Māori children. The centre offers a full-day, morning or afternoon sessions.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that it offers a semi-structured programme with a focus on mathematics and literacy for children in a safe, warm, nurturing learning environment. An emphasis is also placed on developing positive, reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whānau.</p><p>Kindy Tweenz and the neighbouring Kindy Kidz centre work very closely together. Children learn and play in two age-based groups and throughout the week, each group alternates between both.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified the need to continue to review and further develop assessment, planning, evaluation and to increase the focus on children's learning dispositions. These areas are being addressed but further development is required. Good progress has been made in integrating literacy and mathematics into children's play.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have established strong respectful, reciprocal relationships with children and their families. They are responsive to children’s interests, learning, social and emotional needs. Teachers engage in children's play encouraging and supporting them to develop their interests. Children experience success through responsive teaching strategies and well-planned environment. Teachers have identified a need to strengthen their use of te reo Māori and have undertaken self review to develop their confidence in using words and waiata.</p><p>Children who require educational support are clearly identified and teachers work in close partnership with parents and external agencies. Highly inclusive practice supports these children to experience positive learning outcomes.</p><p>A newly implemented appraisal system has been introduced to build teacher capability. Teachers use inquiry goals to strengthen capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. An effective process for internal evaluation is being implemented and is focussed on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>An experienced centre leader values the views and opinions of the teaching team. She has developed a culture where teachers inquire into their teaching practice to make positive changes to children's learning. Teachers' inquiries are linked to the strategic direction of the service and focus on building their confidence and capability. Children benefit from knowledgeable and reflective leaders and teachers who are focused on strengthening teaching and learning.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum which offers a range of activities and resources to engage them in learning, including science, te reo Māori, technology and physical challenges. Literacy and numeracy is highly visible in the environment and is a strong focus of the programme. Children benefit from rich learning oral conversations.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children's learning through portfolios. Child voice is highly evident and children are able to reflect on their own learning and set goals. There is a need to continue to strengthen the assessment process to include documented evidence of dispositional learning, and individual children's interests. Strengthening the focus on documenting language culture and identity for all learners is also a key next step. There is regular termly reporting to parents. Planning is visible for parents, and linked to the centre’s annual plan that includes teacher led topics and child’s emerging interests. Children benefit from an environment which is thoughtfully planned and provides opportunities for them to be sustained and engaged in purposeful learning.</p><p>Parents and whānau are highly valued as partners in their child’s learning. They work alongside each other contributing to the learning of their child. Parents contribute to the programme using their skills and expertise and find teachers approachable and welcoming. They are well informed about their children's learning. Children and their families have developed a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children's wellbeing and belonging are promoted as they learn to negotiate and make friends. Transitions within and between the centres are well supported by parents and teachers who work collaboratively.</p><p>There is a clear vision and direction for the centre. The centre owners have collaborated with the teaching teams and goals have been developed which are regularly monitored by management and the supervisors. There is alignment between the strategic plan, annual plan, philosophy and teachers professional development. Sound systems and practice focus on continuous improvement for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for Kindy Tweenz is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural assessment practices and the use of learning dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidate the appraisal process to include regular mentoring and documented observations of teaching practice which includes specific feedback and feed forward. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindy Tweenz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindy Tweenz will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>6 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"></a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
