</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Hastings Central provides education and care for children from birth to school age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, approximately half of the children enrolled identified as Māori.</p><p>Since the February 2015 ERO report, a new centre manager and a team leader have been appointed.  The centre has experienced significant changes to staffing.  Most teachers are fully qualified. <br> Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports the teaching team.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified several areas requiring further improvement. These included: strengthening the curriculum for infants and toddlers; assessment planning and evaluation; extending the bicultural curriculum and promoting success for Māori as Māori. In addition, developing staff understanding and use of guiding policies and procedures, including hazard identification were needed. Good progress has been made to improve these areas.</p><p>ABC Hastings Central is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are learning to explore, be confident, take risks and follow their interests. They experience warm and respectful relationships and interactions. Teachers know children well and work alongside them supporting their learning.</p><p>Teachers sensitively respond to and support infants’ and toddlers’ needs for strong and secure attachments. They maintain a calm and unhurried pace in which younger children have space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on extending the curriculum through the centre's natural environment and supporting children to be active urban explorers. They have many opportunities to explore their local neighbourhood through regular excursions.</p><p>A recent review of the centre philosophy was undertaken with staff, including contributions from parents and whānau. Leaders and teachers, in partnership with their community, should now determine what the service's key valued learning outcomes are for children. This should help them to decide curriculum priorities and the teachers' practices that will support realisation of these ideals.</p><p>Kaupapa Māori aspects are well promoted and evident in the centre. Children have opportunities to celebrate and share their whakapapa with their peers. Some teachers confidently use te reo Māori with children. A next step to enrich the bicultural curriculum is to support all teachers to use te reo Māori in everyday practice in the centre.</p><p>Learning partnerships with families and whānau are developing well. Teachers are increasing their knowledge about how to use parent and whānau aspirations to plan and design a curriculum that is meaningful for their child's learning.</p><p>A useful programme planning framework has recently been implemented. All children's needs are planned for individually. Teachers notice children’s learning and interests.</p><p>Leaders agree that the assessment, planning and evaluation needs to support greater challenge, complexity and progression for children's learning. As this process develops, leaders and teachers should consider ways teachers can make clearer links to the learning dispositions, the services valued outcomes and the valued outcomes in the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki (</em>2017)<em>.</em></p><p>A well-considered approach for children transitioning into and through the centre is in place. The centre actively supports their transition to school. A range of useful strategies are used to engage parents in all aspects of this transition.</p><p>The professional service manager and business manager provide regular feedback, support and guidance for ongoing improvement to the curriculum implementation, teaching and learning and centre operation. Leaders and teachers continue to build a culture in which children are first and foremost in all aspects of the centre.</p><p>A sound appraisal system is in place to support and grow teachers' capability. Formal observations of practice provides useful information about the quality of teaching. In addition, teachers and leaders are building their capabilities through an inquiry and knowledge-building framework to help improve outcomes for children. BestStart provides opportunities for staff to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>Teachers are growing their confidence and understanding of group, individual reflection and self review to improve their practice. Leaders should consider ways to support the teaching team to build their internal evaluation understanding and capability. This should assist leaders and teachers to evaluate how well and which practices impact positively on children’s learning. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>support teachers to use te reo Māori in their practice</li>
<li>strengthen the centre's philosophy statement</li>
<li>enhance aspects of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle</li>
<li>build teachers' internal evaluation understanding and capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Hastings Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Hastings Central will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>1 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
