</table><p>New Brighton Community Preschool and Nursery requires further development. The long process of earthquake recovery in this community has hampered the ability of the board, centre leaders, and staff to maintain and continue to improve the quality of the curriculum, governance and management systems and practices. After returning to their building after earthquake repairs in late 2016, they have begun to refocus. They need more support to improve curriculum, management, and governance practices to provide high quality education for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>New Brighton Community Preschool and Nursery provides education and care for babies, infants and children to school age in two separate areas. The nursery and the preschool classrooms each have direct access to their own outdoor area. Nearly all the staff are qualified and certificated early childhood teachers. The centre manager and many of the staff have worked at the centre for a number of years.</p><p>The service is administered by a board of parent and community representatives who are elected annually.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have made little progress to meet the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. Increasing te ao Māori in the programme remains an area for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive and affirming relationships with their teachers and each other. Children interact well together, sharing ideas and inviting other children to join their play. They are well supported by their teachers. Teachers listen carefully, offer suggestions and provide additional resources or experiences to help children extend their ideas and interests.</p><p>Children successfully use the inviting and thoughtfully presented learning environment to develop their creativity and to engage in purposeful learning with each other. Teachers make good use of the local community to extend children's knowledge of their environment and the range of experiences that they provide for children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the nursery are nurtured in a calm and inviting environment. Teachers have a good knowledge and understanding of each child and their family. They use this information appropriately to provide an environment where infants and toddlers are confident to explore and build relationships with others.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported and included in the programme. Teachers make good use of outside agency support to improve their knowledge and support these children. Other children actively seek the best ways to help children with diverse needs and involve them in their play.</p><p>A four-year involvement in professional development to learn about and support children from Pacific cultures shows a high level of commitment by teachers to these children and their culture. However, the outcomes for children from this professional development have still to be evaluated.</p><p>Board members are committed and active in the centre. They regularly participate in training and have a good understanding of their roles and responsibilities. This provides them with an appropriate foundation for improving aspects of governance such as the strategic plan and internal evaluation.</p><p>Assessment of children's learning and programme plans provides parents, teachers and children with a good record of children's interests and the wide range of experiences provided within the centre and the wider community. However, next steps for learning, the range of ways teachers will support their learning, and evaluation of the learning outcomes are not clear.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the service leaders agree that the next steps are to build governance, management and leadership capability and capacity to sustain the service and improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing priorities for learning that are clearly articulated and reflected in the centre philosophy, the strategic plan, assessment and programme planning, and internal evaluation</li>
<li>developing an in-depth understanding of internal evaluation, ensuring that evaluations are well documented, and showing evidence of the process and outcomes for children's learning</li>
<li>developing strategic planning that shows how the key priorities will be achieved, regularly monitored, evaluated and reported</li>
<li>increasing staff knowledge and use of te ao Māori in the programme and documentation</li>
<li>developing ways to ensure Māori children experience success as Māori</li>
<li>improving appraisal systems and practices for teachers and leaders.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of New Brighton Community Preschool &amp; Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing and maintaining effective governance and management practices, particularly internal evaluation and strategic planning.<br>[47(1)(a) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve compliance, the leaders must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the level of monitoring around excursions and related documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of New Brighton Community Preschool &amp; Nursery will be within two years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>2 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
