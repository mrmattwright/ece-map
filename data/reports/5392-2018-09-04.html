</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim) is licensed for 44 children over two years of age. It provides all-day education and care four and a half days a week in a purpose-built facility with extensive grounds. All permanently-appointed teachers are qualified and certificated early childhood teachers. The centre serves a diverse community.</p><p>The kindergarten is administered and supported by the Marlborough Kindergarten Association (MKA). The association is a not-for-profit, community-based provider. A general manager is responsible for the operation of the kindergartens. A senior teacher provides ongoing advice and guidance to the kindergartens. A kaiarahi Māori supports culturally responsive practice. Strategic direction and governance decisions are the responsibility of an elected board of trustees.</p><p>Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim)'s philosophy gives emphasis to providing an environment where children and families are supported to become life-long learners, empowering children to be confident in who they are, valuing te ao Māori, the natural world, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2014 review, Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim) has had several changes in the head teacher role. The most recent head teacher was promoted from within the centre and is known within the kindergarten community. Teachers have improved the quality of annual planning. Assessment and planning practices continue to require further development.</p><p>The association is involved in the Piritahi and Te Wheke Akoranga Kāhui Ako |Community of Learning. Mayfield Kindergarten is a member of the Piritahi Kāhui Ako| Community of Learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Marlborough Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are empowered to take responsibility for themselves and others. Tuakana teina relationships (where older, or more knowledgeable children support other children) are highly evident. Children are well supported by teachers and the kindergarten’s routines to increasingly develop their confidence, independence and leadership.</p><p>Teachers effectively meet children's needs through intentional, inclusive teaching practices. They are very deliberate about the way they interact with children to extend children's learning and support their social development. Children have many opportunities to lead their own learning and constructively engage in problem-solving towards new learning. They regularly revisit earlier learning experiences and discuss these with teachers and other children.</p><p>Children, whānau and parents are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. Considerable care is provided in settling children and their whanau into the centre. Teachers show their commitment to building positive relationships with parents and whānau by working in partnership with them to support children’s learning and wellbeing. Regular whānau meetings enable free exchange of ideas and sharing of information. Positive, nurturing relationships, where children’s resilience is fostered, are features of this kindergarten.</p><p>Children learn in settled and well-considered learning environments. The extensive outdoor areas are well utilised as an outdoor classroom. Indoor and outdoor environments are purposeful, well-resourced and attractively presented. They invite children’s engagement, spark interest and curiosity and foster further exploration and learning. Teachers are deliberate about literacy, mathematics and oral language development within the learning programme. They value children's home life experiences as contexts for learning at kindergarten</p><p>The kindergarten celebrates Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual heritage. Te reo and tikanga Māori are used in meaningful contexts, as part of everyday language and are seamlessly woven into children's learning. Values of manaakitanga (caring) and whanaungatanga (relationships and connections) are highly evident. Pou (guardians) are valued whānau. Ūkaipōtanga, a te ao Māori concept that supports strong connections to the land, is underpinned by the way teachers foster a sense of belonging for children and their whānau. Māori children are well supported to succeed. The kindergarten’s philosophy of environmental sustainability is highly evident.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by professional learning and development. The senior teacher regularly provides a range of useful feedback and guidance to assist teaching and learning, use of Te Whāriki, the new early childhood curriculum, and support for new leadership. Teachers and children also benefit from access to regular guidance from the kaiarahi Māori, who is based at the kindergarten.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2014 reviews of kindergartens in the Association, a new general manager, senior teacher and office administrator have been appointed. The board is working towards a new strategic plan. Managers and leaders have proactively addressed ERO’s recommendation for the association identified in previous reports by strengthening the appraisal policy and processes. However this is in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>The MKA is strongly committed to ensuring all children have equitable access to inclusive education. This is very evident in the association's philosophy that promotes facilitating learning opportunities through positive relationships, celebrating diversity and ensuring equitable access to education. The philosophy is reflected in decisions made by the board and leadership.</p><p>Kindergartens receive a high level of support from the Marlborough Kindergarten Association. With a number of new head teachers, attention has been placed on growing leadership and building a cohesive culture across the kindergartens. MKA’s involvement in the Kāhui Ako|Communities of Learning is making a significant difference to developing teaching as inquiry, transition to school and culturally responsive practices. Teachers are well supported by the kaiarahi Māori to build culturally responsive practices.</p><p>The board and leadership work well together with clear roles and responsibilities. Leadership provides quality reports to the board so they are well informed. Board and leaders make good use of internal evaluation to consult with the parent community and staff, to reflect on their own practice and support decision-making.</p><p>The board and association have identified that strategic planning is a key next step. ERO and the association acknowledge that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plans need to be more focused on strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>significant board decisions need to be underpinned by action plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the association's values need to be more clearly articulated.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and ERO also agree that there is a need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop guidelines that outline association expectations for teaching and learning to better support consistency of practice and sustainability across the kindergartens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement planned observations into appraisal practices in all kindergartens.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten leadership and teachers have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve teachers' consistency in implementing assessment, planning and evaluation for individuals and groups of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make better use of evaluation findings and monitor the effectiveness of resulting actions and impacts on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mayfield Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim) will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>4 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
