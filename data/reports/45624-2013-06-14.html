</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>McLeod Kids Childcare provides full day education and care for up to 60 children from three months to five years of age. The centre opened in 2011 and this is the first ERO review of the service. The roll has grown considerably and the centre is operating at nearly full capacity. The centre operates as three separate rooms catering for the needs of different age groups. Children have ready access to outdoor areas.</p><p>McLeod Kids Childcare is a privately owned centre. The owners work in the centre managing the finances, property, and other aspects of governance, as well as fulfilling some teaching roles. They delegate the day-to-day management and leadership of the centre to a centre manager.</p><p>The centre manager is building a new professional teaching team. The new teaching team is developing a shared centre philosophy and is examining different programme planning and assessment practices. Over 80 percent of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Many are working towards full teacher registration.</p><p>The centre aims to provide an environment where children can become confident, capable learners, with a secure sense of identity. Teachers are encouraged to help children to lead their own learning. Bicultural practices and acknowledgement of cultural diversity are incorporated into the programme. Teachers are expected to work closely with parents and whƒÅnau to promote children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is evident in teaching practices, the learning environment, and children‚Äôs play.</p><p>The centre has a calm, settled tone. Children enjoy respectful relationships with adults and each other. Teachers provide high quality care for infants and toddlers and build trusting relationships with them. Older children confidently initiate conversations and engage in cooperative play with each other.</p><p>High quality care is evident for babies and toddlers. In the Under 2 room, the centre has introduced teaching practices that uphold the child as powerful and self-motivated learners who have an innate capacity to develop naturally. Children are active participants in all care activities and develop motor skills naturally without adult intervention.</p><p>Throughout the centre teachers are careful observers, allowing children to direct and make decisions about their own play. They support children‚Äôs interests and facilitate their exploration, language development and engagement in learning. The learning environment is inviting and well resourced. Children are supported to make independent choices in their play. Learning areas are well defined and are arranged to enable a flow of play between the indoor and outdoor environments. Outdoor areas provide for a range of engaging activities, including physical play and enjoyment of the natural environment.</p><p>Children enjoy a programme that focuses on their emerging interests and dispositions for learning. The programme offers many authentic learning opportunities. These include children being involved in preparing nutritious daily meals. Early literacy and mathematical skills and understandings are acquired through play in many learning situations. These good practices result in a programme that is responsive and meaningful to children.</p><p>The centre programme includes initiatives that promote and foster success for MƒÅori children. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated into the programme and environment. As a result, the cultural identity of MƒÅori children is affirmed and contributes to their sense of belonging.</p><p>Cultural diversity is acknowledged and celebrated in the learning programme. As roll numbers grow it is timely for centre leaders to monitor how well programme planning promotes and affirms the different cultural heritages of the centre‚Äôs Pacific children.</p><p>Teachers are participating in professional learning and development with an external facilitator to develop a more consistent centre approach to programme planning that guides and reflects children‚Äôs deeper learning. They are also exploring different ways of ensuring that children‚Äôs learning through the programme is more clearly evident to parents and children.</p><p>Effective governance and professional leadership contributes to the centre being well placed to achieve positive outcomes for children. The owners have established an appropriate framework of administrative, personnel and health and safety systems to underpin centre operations. The centre manager articulates the vision that she is developing with the teaching team and ensures that teachers have a common understanding of expectations for their professional practice.</p><p>Centre leaders have a good understanding of self review and use it well to support ongoing improvements. Parent ideas are valued as part of the centre review process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps to support ongoing improvements in the centre are for centre leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to refine centre programme planning</li>
<li>document the service‚Äôs strategic priorities and associated goals and develop a manageable system for systematically monitoring progress towards these goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of McLeod Kids Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of McLeod Kids Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 June 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
