<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A supplementary review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Tongan Tamaki Fe'ofa'aki Pre-School governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the August 2011 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the learning environment, including provision for children‚Äôs health and safety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programme management and implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>management and self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that arise during the course of the review.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Tongan Tamaki Fe‚Äôofa‚Äôaki Pre-School in Glen Innes provides a Tongan language immersion programme for up to 20 children. It operates alongside and under the auspices of the Tongan Langafonua Community Centre. A management committee oversees day-to-day operations and reports to the governing board. A parent group supports the centre with fundraising.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report affirmed the richness of Tongan language and culture in the centre. This richness remains a strength that underpins centre operations and contributes to a sense of belonging and community amongst staff, children and their families.</p><p>This is ERO‚Äôs fifth review of the centre in seven years. ERO‚Äôs 2011 report identified significant, ongoing concerns in all areas of centre operations. They included working relationships in the centre and a number of health and safety matters. ERO recommended that the centre work with external advisers to make the improvements required. With this professional support, the centre has made progress in several areas.</p><p>Changes have included a new licensee and new supervisor. The licensee and teaching team have the potential to continue improving the quality of teaching and learning with ongoing professional advice and support.</p><p>The staff are beginning to work together more collaboratively and are improving their understanding of early childhood education practices. Some work has been done recently to improve the physical environment and address health and safety practices. The licensee and committee have developed a strategic plan and associated annual plan, and have begun to review centre policies.</p><p>The quality of children‚Äôs learning experiences continues to be constrained by limited resources and poor presentation of the learning environment. Teachers‚Äô understandings about current theory and best practice in early childhood education are still at the early stages. The management committee has further work to do to establish transparent and useful management and financial planning. It needs to maintain the recent momentum for change in the centre. Accessing high quality, in-centre professional advice and support is essential for further improvement in provision for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education prioritise the relicensing of Tongan Tamaki Fe‚Äôofa‚Äôaki Preschool and assess the centre‚Äôs compliance with the 2008 regulations and applicable licensing criteria. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Programme Management and Implementation</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2011 ERO report identified the need for improvements in the quality of learning experiences and programme management. More professional working relationships between managers and staff needed to be developed. Self review and management planning were not well established and several health and safety matters needed to be addressed. ERO recommended that the centre work with external advisers to make the significant improvements needed.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, changes have included a new licensee and the appointment of a longstanding member of staff as the new supervisor. A second provisionally registered teacher and a staff member with Tongan teaching experience have also been appointed. Of the five regular teaching staff, two are provisionally registered.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The programme is becoming less adult directed and teachers are recognising the value of learning through play. Children have better opportunities to choose from available resources, and enjoy fitness activities and time outside. During periods of child-initiated play there is a settled, calm atmosphere. Caring, trusting relationships are evident.</p><p>The richness of the Tongan language used by teachers as they interact with children remains a strength in the programme. This strong language base helps provide a good basis for children‚Äôs literacy learning. Children are confident to speak in front of others. Their sense of wellbeing and belonging as Tongan is well supported.</p><p>The indoor environment is bright and freshly painted with new notice boards in the main play rooms. Other recent improvements include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the provision of safe-fall material in the outdoor playground, repaired fencing and the addition of gates at the side of the building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a newly established separate space for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the purchase of additional resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the developing relationships with a local school to support improved transitions for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers express a commitment to improving their practice. They are beginning to work together more as a team, review the way that they work and improve the programme for children. The qualified staff have focused on developing attractive portfolios for children. Portfolios contain regular stories about children‚Äôs activities and include comments from parents. Teachers are considering ways to strengthen their partnership with parents in planning for children‚Äôs learning.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>The small amount of educational resources and their quality and presentation, remain a concern. Limited challenge and choice contributes to a lack of focus, purpose and complexity in children‚Äôs play. This often leads to inappropriate behaviour. Teachers and managers should work with an external adviser with expertise in early childhood education environments to develop a budget and plan to improve the learning environment for children. This improvement should include well organised storage for outside equipment.</p><p>Programme planning has been very limited. Teachers are now aware they need to plan together to be more responsive to individual children‚Äôs abilities and interests. Improved assessment and planning would help staff to identify ways to make programmes more interesting and stimulating for children.</p><p>Teachers should consider how to better support children‚Äôs growing independence as learners. They could increase:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the time children have to play either inside or in the outdoor play area, and reduce the number of times they interrupt child-led play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children‚Äôs access to a quiet space for enjoying books, and a wider variety of writing and drawing materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the choice of interesting and inviting spaces and experiences for children to reduce overcrowding at activities brought out by adults.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teaching staff should participate together in ongoing professional development to help them understand good quality early childhood education practices and how these could be applied appropriately in this Tongan cultural setting. Shared assessment, planning and evaluation should value all staff and parent contributions while honouring the leadership and cultural wisdom of more longstanding members of the centre‚Äôs community.</p><h3>The Quality of Management and Self Review</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The licensee and management committee have made good progress in several areas, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>preparing useful strategic and annual plans as a basis for regular, ongoing review and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing an appraisal process to affirm good practice and identify goals for staff development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional development opportunities for teachers and managers, including leadership, self review and team building opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>managing improved working relationships amongst staff and managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a plan for ongoing self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>The licensee and management committee could support continued improvement in the centre by establishing more robust and transparent management practices. They should also:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to review policies and procedures, and ensure they reflect the centre‚Äôs philosophy and underpinning Tongan language and culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align policies and the strategic plan with the 2008 regulations and licensing criteria for early childhood services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly review and update new strategic and annual plans to continue the momentum for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly monitor income and expenditure against annual budgets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that the centre‚Äôs accounts are efficiently kept, audited promptly, and reported to the centre‚Äôs community within 90 days of the end of the financial year.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The management committee should align employment contracts, teacher job descriptions and appraisal processes with registered teacher criteria and legislative requirements. They should also consider ways to access more robust advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers.</p><h3>Provision for Health and Safety</h3><p>While most of the items identified in ERO‚Äôs 2011 report have been addressed, managers and staff must be more vigilant in providing for the safety of children and adults in the environment. They urgently need a robust system for identifying, removing or minimising hazards and ensuring that all adults in the centre are aware of potential risks. Further health and safety matters to be addressed include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that appropriate heating maintains the required temperature in all indoor areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>removing trip hazards posed by curled matting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that parents have given approval for staff-to-child ratios on local excursions and that risk management for all trips is clearly documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular monitoring to ensure that parents sign out each day, sign the record if their child has had an accident, and sign medication approvals as required.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should review and expand the centre‚Äôs behaviour management policy with a view to building children‚Äôs social competence. They should work with an external adviser and parents to develop specific strategies for modelling and promoting skills for positive social interaction, negotiation, and peaceful conflict resolution.</p><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO recommends that the licensee engages a high quality professional adviser to work with staff to build on recent developments and support continual improvement in the quality of teaching and learning in the centre.</p><a id="5-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must:</p><p>5.1 address health and safety concerns and improve the physical environment and resourcing to support a good quality programme¬†<em>Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 1d; Education (ECC) Regulations 1998, 24(4),27(3b)</em></p><p>5.2 ensure that educators demonstrate an understanding of current best practice in early childhood education, and extend children‚Äôs thinking and actions through sensitive and informed guidance, interventions and support¬†<em>Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 1b,2</em></p><p>5.3 develop and implement employment policies that incorporate the principles of being a good employer and promote good quality practices¬†<em>Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 11a,b</em></p><p>5.4 develop and implement financial management procedures, including budgeting, to ensure that objectives for high quality care and education are met¬†<em>Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 11c.</em></p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education prioritise the relicensing of Tongan Tamaki Fe‚Äôofa‚Äôaki Preschool and assess the centre‚Äôs compliance with the 2008 regulations and applicable licensing criteria.

It operates alongside and under the auspices of the Tongan Langafonua Community Centre. A management committee oversees day-to-day operations and reports to the governing board. A parent group supports the centre with fundraising.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report affirmed the richness of Tongan language and culture in the centre. This richness remains a strength that underpins centre operations and contributes to a sense of belonging and community amongst staff, children and their families.</p><p>This is ERO‚Äôs fifth review of the centre in seven years. ERO‚Äôs 2011 report identified significant, ongoing concerns in all areas of centre operations. They included working relationships in the centre and a number of health and safety matters. ERO recommended that the centre work with external advisers to make the improvements required. With this professional support, the centre has made progress in several areas.</p><p>Changes have included a new licensee and new supervisor. The licensee and teaching team have the potential to continue improving the quality of teaching and learning with ongoing professional advice and support.</p><p>The staff are beginning to work together more collaboratively and are improving their understanding of early childhood education practices. Some work has been done recently to improve the physical environment and address health and safety practices. The licensee and committee have developed a strategic plan and associated annual plan, and have begun to review centre policies.</p><p>The quality of children‚Äôs learning experiences continues to be constrained by limited resources and poor presentation of the learning environment. Teachers‚Äô understandings about current theory and best practice in early childhood education are still at the early stages. The management committee has further work to do to establish transparent and useful management and financial planning. It needs to maintain the recent momentum for change in the centre. Accessing high quality, in-centre professional advice and support is essential for further improvement in provision for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education prioritise the relicensing of Tongan Tamaki Fe‚Äôofa‚Äôaki Preschool and assess the centre‚Äôs compliance with the 2008 regulations and applicable licensing criteria. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.¬†</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p>
