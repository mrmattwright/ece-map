</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Agape Christian Preschool provides early childhood education from birth to school age. It is situated in the western suburbs of Rotorua and is licensed for up to 60 children, including up to 10 under two years of age. The service comprises large indoor and outdoor play areas for the older children. In addition to the preschool, a separate building provides a home-like environment that caters for children under two years of age.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises children being children, with a strong emphasis on them taking risks, being creative, and exploring the natural environment. It also places importance on developing meaningful partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. The philosophy promotes a blend of teacher and child-initiated ideas and activities, and is underpinned by emphases on christian values of love and caring for one another.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have created a calm family-like environment where children‚Äôs wellbeing and belonging is strongly nurtured. Positive and respectful relationships are a feature of the centre. A range of strategies and initiatives such as Duffy books, pickups and drop offs, extra free hours, collaboration with Group Special Education (GSE), and external agencies provide much needed support for families requiring assistance especially low socio-economic families. Teachers have established meaningful connections with children, their parents and whƒÅnau through the use of an online assessment programme, parent evenings, practices that support the transitioning of new children, and day-to-day interactions.</p><p>Christian principles positively influence the quality of relationships, teachers‚Äô interactions with children, the programme, and the physical and emotional environment. Interactions among teachers and children are consistently respectful and gentle. Teachers in the under two area are highly responsive to the strengths and needs of each child. Sensitive and responsive interactions are contributing positively to children‚Äôs sense of belonging and confidence. The four year old programme provides a strong basis for developing children‚Äôs oral language, literacy and mathematical knowledge, skills and concepts. This programme is developing children's confidence and readiness for a successful transition to school.</p><p>Children engage in a wide range of purposeful activities that support and extend their thinking, exploration and learning. Science is a feature of the learning programme. The children take a strong interest in learning about the natural environment, stars and planets. Teachers are good models of oral language and frequently engage in sustained conversations with children to extend their thinking and vocabulary. There is a strong desire of all staff to promote MƒÅori children's language, culture and identity. All staff participated in an NgƒÅti Whakaue initiative to strengthen their practice and responsiveness to MƒÅori children. Curriculum self review identifies ways to strengthen teacher practice and to further develop and promote positive outcomes for children. The teaching team has identified the need to continue to develop their responsiveness to MƒÅori children.</p><p>A highly developed system for planning, assessment and evaluation involves all teachers and is focused on positive outcomes for children. Assessment information identifies learning dispositions and shows progressive learning over time and how to extend and build on children's interests. Six month evaluations provide the platform for further goal setting in partnership with parents. A next step is to deepen bicultural assessment practices and to continue to engage parents as partners in their children's learning.</p><p>The principal teacher effectively supports teachers to develop and grow their professional practice. There is a well-developed appraisal process where teachers receive constructive and affirming feedback and feed forward about their teaching. Teachers are expected to set appraisal goals and to identify relevant professional learning and development to enhance their practice. They are also encouraged to take on various leadership roles. New teachers are well supported to feel part of a collaborative team and are empowered to grow and learn in their roles.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Agape Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Agape Christian Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>1 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
