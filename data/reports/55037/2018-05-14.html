</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frimley Park Kindergarten is in Hastings. It opens Monday to Friday from 8:30am until 2:30pm. Kindergarten day places are available for children aged from two to six years. The philosophy is based on the principle of whanaungatanga. Of the 37 children on the roll, seven are Māori and four of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The May 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development, including: assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning; self review; and educational success for Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>A new head teacher has recently been appointed in an acting role, in Term 1 2018.</p><p>Frimley Park is one of 16 kindergartens governed and managed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). An ongoing programme of restructuring began in 2016 and the association has experienced significant changes at all levels. A new general manager was appointed in January 2016 and an advisor - education delivery in November 2017.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified that the association should establish, review and monitor the implementation of guiding documents in individual kindergartens and undertake self review at association level.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Heretaunga Free Kindergarten Association.<i></i></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and capable learners, empowered to take responsibility for their own learning through a curriculum that promotes their independence, curiosity and risk taking. The physical environment promotes challenge and discovery where children are engaged in meaningful learning experiences.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging is supported through positive reciprocal relationships between teachers and whānau. Parents have regular opportunities to be involved in their child's kindergarten.</p><p>A review of the kindergarten philosophy is planned for, in relation to the forming of a new teaching team. This should result in the development of clearer identification of learning priorities and valued outcomes for children. Understanding of what this looks like, should guide teaching practice.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to children's interests and promotes their successful outcomes. A <br> child-centred, holistic programme supports learning.</p><p>Teachers continue to refine assessment and planning processes. Children’s individual and group interests are successfully extended. Planning makes clear connections between individual interests and teaching strategies. A key next step is to develop plans for the individual child that respond to parent aspirations and seek to make learning deeper and more complex over time.  </p><p>Children's journals provide a record of their learning, participation and development. Further strengthening of these aspects should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a shared understanding of what good quality assessment looks like to guide practice</li>
<li>making links to the cultural context and learning outcomes for all learners<em></em></li>
<li>more deliberately showing progress in learning over time</li>
<li>clearly documenting how teachers respond to whānau voice and aspirations for their child.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are committed to further growing their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori throughout the curriculum. Te reo Māori is integrated into conversations. Children have opportunities to engage in kapa haka, waiata and karanga. Continuing to strengthen responsiveness is an ongoing focus.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge Pacific children's culture. Further work is required to develop culturally responsive practices to better respond to these children's success as Pacific learners.</p><p>Positive gains in staff understanding of the use of internal evaluation are evident. Teacher inquiry and review informs practices and guides decisions for improvement. A range of strategic and emergent reviews have contributed to change and improvement, aligned to service priorities. Evaluating in relation to clear indicators with a focus on outcomes for children is a next step.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the needs of children and their whānau as they settle into the kindergarten. Positive connections and established links to the local community support smooth transitions to school for children and families.</p><p>Children with additional needs join in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers. They are well supported by teachers and other adults. Teachers are inclusive, and make appropriate use of a variety of successful approaches to meet the needs of all learners.</p><p>Leadership is supportive and collaborative. The head teacher's leadership is improvement-focused. A team culture is encouraged, where staff reflect on their teaching to make changes that support children’s learning.</p><p>The governance and leadership team is well placed to continue to manage ongoing change and to set the strategic direction for the association to promote future sustainability. They are making good progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the previous ERO review. Continuing to strengthen and evaluate systems to monitor progress in individual kindergartens remains a key next step.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Senior leaders and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Frimley Park Kindergarten, to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation for individuals</li>
<li>develop strategies that promote education success for Pacific children</li>
<li>develop understanding and practice of evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frimley Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the association should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure robust regular policy review and strengthen systems to promote teachers’ understanding and implementation of guiding policies</li>
<li>implement robust social media and online policies and procedures to ensure that all reasonable steps have been made to protect children's online safety and that parents are well informed of these.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frimley Park Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>14 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
