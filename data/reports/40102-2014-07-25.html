</table><p>Te Manaaki Educational Preschool Trust requires further development in governance, management, leadership and aspects of teaching practice so that improvements are made and sustained.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Manaaki Educational Pre-School Trust provides care and education for children from birth to school age. A non-profit trust has overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with legal obligations and aspects of management that relate to finances, strategic planning and employment of staff. The centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report recommended that improvements be made in strategic planning and self review. Some progress has been made in improving these areas. The previous ERO report also noted children were receiving good quality education and care, and the service was been effectively led and governed.</p><p>Unfortunately the service has not been able to sustain and build on these good practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>This ERO review has identified the need for significant areas for improvement in the areas of governance, management and leadership. These areas have the potential to adversely affect the quality of teaching and education children receive.</p><p>ERO observations of teaching practice affirm that children are well supported to explore their interests and make good use of an expansive outdoor environment. Children are encouraged to develop a range of knowledge and skills, and work cooperatively with and alongside others. Younger children are cared for in a well-presented environment where they receive close care and affectionate support. Children enjoy warm and gentle relationships with adults and one another.</p><p>Children engage in meaningful conversations with teachers. These opportunities allow teachers to extend children's thinking and develop supportive relationships. Children are encouraged to explore and be creative. Several staff members have a good understanding of MƒÅori values, beliefs and cultural practices. They use te reo MƒÅori frequently in authentic contexts, providing positive modelling for children and other staff.</p><p>Improvements in the service should focus on strengthening governance, management and leadership in order to further promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The trust and staff need to improve their working relationship. A lack of unity is impacting on the service‚Äôs ability to work cohesively and constructively. A priority is for the trust and staff is to engage in open and transparent dialogue to improve communication and resolve issues that are impacting on the service‚Äôs capacity to provide high-quality education for children.</p><p>There is no annual plan that sets priorities for the operation of the service. Self-review processes and practices at all levels are insufficient to sustain ongoing improvement to centre operation and the quality of education and care.</p><p>Aspects of day-to-day management and leadership require significant improvement. No appraisals of teachers have been undertaken since 2012, and job descriptions have not been updated to reflect the shared leadership role in the over two‚Äôs room. Staff have not been able to participate in ongoing, targeted professional learning and development because of financial constraints associated with the declining roll. There has been a lack of leadership in supporting teachers to strengthen their practice.</p><p>Assessment information documented in children‚Äôs portfolios is variable. There is a need to establish clear expectations for teachers to ensure consistency of practice. Teachers would benefit from external support to help develop these expectations, and grow their professional knowledge and understanding of current assessment theory and practice. Some assessment approaches in the babies and toddlers area are of good quality and could be used as models to help build consistent practice across the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends that the trust and staff:</p><ul>
<li>establish a collegial working partnership</li>
<li>improve the quality of centre management and curriculum leadership</li>
<li>develop high-quality self-review practices, and strategic and annual planning documents</li>
<li>strengthen teacher practice through targeted professional learning and development</li>
<li>address compliance issues identified in this report.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Manaaki Educational Pre-School Trust completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Actions for compliance</span></h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to:</p><ul>
<li>the development of an annual plan to guide the service‚Äôs operation</li>
<li>completion of staff appraisals.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Manaaki Educational Pre-School Trust will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
