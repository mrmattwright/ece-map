</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Lemon Street Early Learning Centre operates in central New Plymouth as part of Kidicorp. The centre previously operated under 2 separate licences on the same premises. It was relicensed under the 2008 regulations in 2013 under 1 lisence. This licence allows for part or full day sessions for up to 70 children including 25 children aged up to 2 years.</p><p>Day-to-day management is overseen by the centre manager, supported by team leaders in each of three areas. Administration support is provided by the office manager. All children have freshly cooked food, daily.</p><p>Three separate areas operate, each with independent indoor and outdoor spaces. These cater for children aged up to 2 years, those aged 2 to 3¬Ω years and those over 3¬Ω years. Both the indoor and outdoor environments have undergone substantial development since the 2011 ERO review. The outdoor environment has been designed with sustainability and natural resources in mind.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs recently revised philosophy aligns with the whakatauki ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe tanagta, he tangata, he tangata‚Äù and focuses on respect, joy, resilience and courage.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happily engaged in sustained, cooperative play. Interactions with teachers are positive. Play is both teacher-facilitated and child-initiated. Children display respect for themselves, others and their surroundings. The extensive, attractive outdoor area caters for children‚Äôs physical needs and invites exploration.</p><p>Children are well supported by teachers to become confident and competent learners. Teachers know them well and contribute positively to their education and care. Routines respond to children‚Äôs needs and encourage growing independence. Resources are easily accessible, attractively stored and offer opportunities to engage in imaginative, active and creative play.</p><p>Natural resources provide a foundation for a curriculum that is underpinned by the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Teachers seek opportunities to enrich the programme. They make good use of community members and include their expertise into the programme. Excursions provide another opportunity to enrich the curriculum. There is good modelling of literacy and numeracy through play.</p><p>The centre has a culture of inclusion. Children with special needs are well catered for and their learning requirements discussed. Individual programmes are developed in consultation with parents and external agencies to meet the needs of these children and their families.</p><p>The cultural backgrounds of children are known and their identities fostered. Families are welcomed and encouraged to share their culture with others.</p><p>Bicultural practices are developing. Teachers seek ways to integrate tikanga MƒÅori into the curriculum in authentic ways. Further development of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori is a priority. Maintaining relationships with whƒÅnau and gaining knowledge of the aspirations they hold for their tamariki is an ongoing development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are very respectful of families and value positive relationships based around teaching and learning. Parents have multiple opportunities to discuss their children‚Äôs learning with teachers and are provided with regular information about children‚Äôs progress. Assessment profiles are attractive and informative. They include observations of children, their learning and records of enrichment events. Parents have an attractive record of the range of their child‚Äôs experiences. Children and parents have ready access to these books.</p><p>Information from individual and group assessment is not yet efficiently used to plan the curriculum. Teachers should use what they notice and recognise in children's learning to plan responses to individuals and groups.</p><p>A positive team culture is highly evident. Collaborative ways of working are fostered between all involved in the service. Governors, leaders and teachers clearly understand the purpose and process of self review for improvement.</p><p>The service is well governed by Kidicorp who provide external professional support and opportunities for focused professional learning. Support and guidance is improvement focused and impacts positively on teacher practices. There is alignment between appraisal, professional practice and strategic intent. Carefully considered improvements have a positive impact on children, parents, and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>grow teacher confidence and competence in promoting te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>improve evaluation and planning practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Lemon Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Lemon Street will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>2 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
