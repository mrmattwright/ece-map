</table><p>Dunsandel Childcare and Preschool Ltd is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dunsandel Childcare and Preschool Ltd also operates under the name Blue Goose Preschool. This centre has two buildings, each with its own outdoor area. One area is for children aged from eight weeks to three and a half years and the other area is for children of approximately three years to school age. Most of the staff are qualified ECE teachers. Two teachers are fully registered and the rest are being well supported by centre management in working towards full registration.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in the areas identified in the August 2011 ERO report. Children‚Äôs successful transition to school is supported by the centre‚Äôs well-established relationship with the local school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive relationships with one another and with teachers. They are well supported in developing their social interactions, independence, and self-care skills. Teachers warmly praise and readily acknowledge children‚Äôs achievements. They involve themselves in children‚Äôs play and allow children to lead the direction of play. ERO observed some teachers who were highly effective in extending children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Children have opportunities to develop an awareness of Aotearoa/New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. Children experience some aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in a range of ways throughout the programme. Some teachers' use of te reo MƒÅori is a good model for others to learn from.</p><p>Centre practices for planning and assessment have strengthened since the 2011 ERO report. Teachers‚Äô planning clearly identifies how they will respond and support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre promotes positive relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers have regular conversations with parents and share useful information about children. Profile books keep parents well informed about their child‚Äôs involvement and learning within the programme. Parents‚Äô views are sought in a variety of ways, including for self review.</p><p>There are established systems to help teachers critically reflect on their individual teaching practices. Teachers identify aspects of their teaching that support children‚Äôs learning and readily make changes when necessary to use more effective practices. A next step will be to consider ways they can more meaningfully incorporate literacy and mathematics concepts and learning in the programme.</p><p>The appointment of two curriculum leaders is providing stronger curriculum leadership. These experienced leaders are very good role models within the programme, and provide helpful mentoring and feedback to other teachers.</p><p>Managers value and are responsive to staff opinions and feedback. There is an emphasis on teamwork between managers and teachers and among teachers. Teachers share useful information about individual children to help them support all children in the programme. Teachers‚Äô strengths are recognised and used to extend the programme. A teacher‚Äôs skills in New Zealand Sign Language have provided opportunities for the youngest children to learn how to communicate through using some sign language.</p><p>Teachers and managers have made significant improvements to self-review practices. They have a process to guide the way they evaluate the effectiveness of their service. They are highly focused on improving outcomes for children. Review practices involve all staff members as well as including the views of parents and at times, children.</p><p>Managers are responsive to external feedback. They have a process for future planning. They have made good use of professional learning and development opportunities to improve aspects of the programme. This is evident in the improvements to planning, self review and the quality of leadership.</p><p>Centre policies provide good guidance for staff in relation to centre expectations and systems for health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and teaching team have good processes for reviewing the effectiveness of their programme. They are now in a good position to make better use of these guidelines to review the effectiveness of teaching practices. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>making use of opportunities to extend children‚Äôs thinking and learning in mathematics</li>
<li>supporting children to respect the learning environment, equipment and resources</li>
<li>developing further and more consistent ways of recording parent involvement in planning and assessment</li>
<li>increasing teachers‚Äô confidence and awareness in understanding bicultural perspectives in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that appraisal could be strengthened to be more effective and useful for teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dunsandel Childcare and Preschool Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dunsandel Childcare and Preschool Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
