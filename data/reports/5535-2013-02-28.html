<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Belfast is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager (ESM) works with each kindergarten, giving feedback and professional support. Since the 2007 ER0 review, Kidsfirst Kindergartens Belfast has changed its hours of operation to better meet the needs of its community and more closely align to the school day. All teachers employed by Kidsfirst Kindergartens are registered and fully qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Teachers focus strongly on fostering positive outcomes for children and families. They provide a very welcoming and inclusive learning environment.</p><p>The kindergarten is situated next to the local school. Teachers have developed purposeful professional relationships with school staff to help children make a successful start to their schooling.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine early childhood education services within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>An atmosphere of whanaungatanga (family and positive relationships) builds children&rsquo;s confidence and that helps give them a sense of belonging. Children display confidence and a sense of ownership in the child-centred environment. They play well with and alongside others, sharing ideas and developing friendships.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They respond to the individual abilities and preferences of children in ways that support their developing independence. Children are encouraged to make decisions about their learning and to adapt resources to test and extend on their ideas. Children&rsquo;s work is valued, respected and well presented in the environment. They have many opportunities to revisit and build on their learning.</p><p>Teachers use a calm, unhurried approach, and a good range of teaching practices, and quality resources, to support children in their learning. They engage children in conversations that appropriately build on their language skills. Teachers give children good feedback on their learning and affirm and celebrate children&rsquo;s efforts with their work.</p><p>Children make good use of the outdoor area to extend their physical skills. They have many opportunities to learn about the natural world and kaitiakitanga (caring for the natural environment). These learning experiences are building children&rsquo;s understanding of sustainability.</p><p>Children benefit from a varied programme that gives emphasis to music, literacy and te reo M&#257;ori. Bicultural practices are well integrated into the programme in ways that are meaningful to children and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture. Children are responsive to te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori (the M&#257;ori language and culture) during teaching interactions. Some children are confident to respond in te reo M&#257;ori. The home cultures and languages of other children are also acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Teachers value the participation and contribution of parents and wh&#257;nau to the programme and their involvement in children&rsquo;s learning. Many parents spend time at the kindergarten working with their own and other children.</p><p>The ESM provides effective professional leadership to the teaching team. Teachers are suitably reflective and open to new learning. The ESM has provided targeted professional development that has successfully lifted the quality of self review and assessment practices. Planned professional development and self review is appropriately focused on improving teaching practices. Effective systems are supporting the kindergarten to maintain its focus on promoting positive outcomes for children. The head teacher values the skills of her team and encourages them to take on leadership roles.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association has a well-developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long-term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work of the kindergarten by the ESM and head teacher. The Kidsfirst Kindergartens senior leadership team has recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them to further identify the appropriate support required to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The Kidsfirst Kindergarten manager and the teaching team have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>consolidate recent developments of self-review and assessment practices</li>
<li>plan in a more complete way and regularly evaluate the impact of the programme and teaching practices on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>focus teachers' goals on extending and improving teachers&rsquo; appraisal to more consistently focus goals on the ongoing improvement to the quality of teaching and learning practices.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Belfast completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>28 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
