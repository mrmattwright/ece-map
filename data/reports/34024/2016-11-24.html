</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rosetown Preschool provides all-day care and education for children from three months to school age, in two age-related learning areas. The majority of children are under four years of age. The current roll is 66, with nine children of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on the wellbeing and learning of children through promoting the MƒÅori values of whakawhanaungatanga, manaakitanga, kotahitanga, tiaki ngƒÅ whƒÅnau, taha tinana, hinengaro and wairua, and aroha. This philosophy promotes children's and families' strong sense of belonging at the centre.</p><p>The centre owners provide quality education and care that is affordable and flexible for families. They ensure low child-to-teacher ratios and provide all food and care requirements, including catering for children with allergies and special needs.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2013, the centre has made significant progress in addressing the next steps for development in leadership and teaching practices. The owner has recently taken over management of the centre and there have been several new staff appointed. An appraisal and registration mentor was appointed in 2015 to support the owner to provide teachers with professional coaching, learning and development opportunities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Rosetown Preschool is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children learn in calm, settled environments that effectively foster their wellbeing and learning, and with their families, experience positive, caring and responsive relationships. They confidently interact with teachers, are actively engaged, and have fun in their learning. They have access to spacious, well-equipped indoor and outdoor areas that support physical challenge and safe risk taking. Children are well supported to find out about the world around them and make sense of it.</p><p>Teachers use children's strengths and interests to provide a rich curriculum that promotes their social, emotional, physical and educational development. They deliberately plan and make links between activities by revisiting children's ideas and interests to add complexity to learning. Teachers use routines effectively to build children's sense of security, self-management skills and social competencies. Through both child and teacher-initiated play, children are able to experiment and explore in environments that encourage imagination and creativity, using a wide variety of open-ended resources. Children are very well supported to take responsibility for their learning and respond positively to new and challenging experiences.</p><p>Teachers skilfully promote oral language development, encourage respect, and respond to children's ideas. They actively involve children in storytelling and foster a love of books. A wide range of mathematical concepts and skills are integrated through children's play and exploration. Children's literacy and mathematical development is fostered.</p><p>Children's learning is enriched through excursions and a range of centre events. They regularly visit local parks and places of interest, and perform at the neighbouring rest home. Older children have the opportunity to participate in a bush programme with a nearby, jointly owned centre. Children's knowledge, skills and dispositions are developed and extended.</p><p>Babies and toddlers enjoy many opportunities to interact and build strong attachments with teachers. A calm, slow pace is maintained for under two year olds, and they are flexible and responsive to the cues of children. The spacious environment is well resourced and provides a safe setting for children not yet mobile, and for those crawling and learning to walk. Teachers respect children‚Äôs right to be informed and consulted about decisions that affect them during routines such as kai times, nappy changing, and play and learning times. Regular communication with parents is seen as critically important and is providing teachers with vital information about children‚Äôs preferences and needs. These caring and respectful practices contribute to high quality provision of care and learning for children up to two years of age.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work in partnership with parents of children with special needs to improve and enhance their learning. A strength of the centre is the inclusive practice that encourages all children to fully participate in the programme. Children and parents experience responsive transitions into, within and from the centre.</p><p>Respect for te ao MƒÅori (the MƒÅori world) is evident in centre practices and the environment. Teachers acknowledge children's identity, and integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into the programme. They have undertaken a range of professional development to develop their understanding of their responsibilities to MƒÅori tamariki and their family. The centre waiata, gifted by the Maniapoto MƒÅori Trust Board, acknowledges local landmarks, and is used and enjoyed by staff and children. Building teacher confidence and practice is continuing in aspects of MƒÅori culture.</p><p>Individual portfolios incorporate parents' aspirations into children's learning goals and show children's progress and learning over time. The next step is to explore more effective ways to share assessment information in a timely way therefore strengthening the learning partnership with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre manager provides effective leadership, and significant support and guidance for staff and families. The professional practice mentor works collaboratively with the owner to build teachers' capabilities and deliver professional development. Leaders have developed clear expectations for planning and assessment. This is effectively guiding teachers' practice and building consistency across the teams. Performance management processes successfully contribute to effective learning and teaching in the centre. A next step is to link observations of teaching practice to criteria for improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Self review is ongoing, spontaneous and responsive, and contributes to positive outcomes for children. The centre has clear policies and processes that provide explicit expectations and guidance for staff. Leaders should include strategic evaluation as part of centre self review. This process should focus on indicators of good teaching and learning practice to identify and affirm how well Rosetown Preschool is achieving its vision and philosophy.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rosetown Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rosetown Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>24 November 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
