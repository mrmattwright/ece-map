</table><p>The Lighthouse Nursery And Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Lighthouse Nursery and Preschool is a Christian-based community early childhood centre governed by the Acorn Trust. The trust is currently involved in a merger process with Building Blocks Community Trust. The trust and centre serve an ethnically diverse community.</p><p>This centre is licensed for up to 50 children, including 14 children under two years. It is open for all-day sessions, five days a week. There are two buildings, one of which is purpose-built for preschool aged children, and the other provides a nursery for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises Christian values. Bicultural practices and the cultural diversity of families are also valued. The philosophy promotes a combination of structured activity and self-choice for fostering children's learning and wellbeing. Developing life and learning skills and providing a mathematics and literacy-rich setting are also key priorities.</p><p>Since ERO's June 2016 review, leadership and staffing have remained relatively unchanged. Two newly appointed head teachers have been internally appointed to lead the nursery and preschool. Most teachers have early childhood qualifications.</p><p>The preschool has made good progress in meeting the recommendations in the June 2016 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for children and their families. Children have a strong sense of identity and belonging. Faith-based approaches to teaching and learning link well to the centre's philosophy and community interests.</p><p>Children confidently lead their learning. They are challenged in their learning and well supported to know about, and engage with, their local environment. Sustainability, and the provision of a natural learning environment incorporating strong MƒÅori values, are thoughtfully embedded and are a feature of the programme.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to participate in an interesting, well-resourced programme. They access a rich and responsive curriculum. Teachers know children well and work effectively together to identify and meet their learning and wellbeing needs. There is a dedicated focus on literacy, mathematics and science and a balance of structured and child-chosen learning.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to children with additional needs. They modify activities to enable children to fully participate when needed. Younger children are supported in a settled, stress free, caring environment. A variety of resources support children's engagement.</p><p>Children's transitions into, within, and out of the nursery and preschool are well supported and celebrated. Parents are well informed and actively included in transition processes. A dedicated teacher supports parents and children through transitions. As a result, children are confident to move into different learning environments.</p><p>A welcoming environment is provided for MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau. This is supported by the way teachers use te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, and acknowledge local history and the Treaty of Waitangi in the programme and environment. Children and parents value New Zealand's bicultural heritage and the children's different cultures.</p><p>Governance and management practices are supporting ongoing centre development. The manager and head teachers have a positive working relationship with the trust. The manager has implemented well-organised systems and effective processes for smooth centre' operations.</p><p>A useful appraisal process ensures teachers are well supported in building their capability to improve teaching practice and is linked to positive outcomes for children. The skills and attributes of leaders and teachers are well recognised, fostered and extended.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers work effectively as a team in building knowledge and sharing ideas for improvement. They are making good use of internal review, and assessment and planning for learning processes to support ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children. To further strengthen assessment and planning for learning practices, leaders need to develop a process for ensuring quality and consistency of practice. This should include developing clear expectations about information that needs to be collected about children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A key next step for the centre is to develop a quality assurance process which includes clear expectations around the documentation of children's learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Lighthouse Nursery And Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must maintain records that show parent acknowledgement when medicine has been administered. <br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS28.</em></p><p>During the onsite phase of the review the service adjusted the records to enable parents to acknowledge when medicine has been administered.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
