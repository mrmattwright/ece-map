</table><p>PORSE Hawke's Bay Q2¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Hawke's Bay Q2 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd. It is one of four networks in Hawke's Bay. Of the 76 children currently enrolled, 16 are MƒÅori.</p><p>At the time of the April 2015 ERO review the organisation had been newly sold to Evolve Education Group Ltd. In late 2018, it was purchased by Rainbow Group. The existing structures for national and community team management have continued. The role of curriculum and quality assurance coach has recently been created to support the work of the national coach.</p><p>In this service two programme tutors, who are qualified and registered teachers, work alongside educators to assist them to implement care and learning programmes for children in the homes. Programme tutors are supported by a regional coach who reports to the senior leadership team. A recent restructure of staffing has resulted in changes to the programme tutor role. Programme tutors working in this network have been employed in the past three years.</p><p>Two options for education and care are offered: the home educator model where the educator works in their own home; and the nanny educator/au-pair model where an educator works in a family‚Äôs home.</p><p>The PORSE vision is ‚Äòexpanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home‚Äô. The philosophy guiding teaching and learning has been refreshed to better acknowledge PORSE‚Äôs commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. There is an emphasis on authentic relationships, environments and learning experiences.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Establishing strong relationships with children, families and whƒÅnau is highly valued and promoted. This supports children‚Äôs sense of belonging within the educator's home.</p><p>Children participate in a curriculum that is based on their interests and needs. They have access to a wide range of in-home opportunities and educators make good use of community resources to enrich learning. PORSE organised playschools, music groups and excursions provide children with interesting challenges and a chance to socialise with peers. Children are given opportunities to revisit and extend their learning.</p><p>Programme tutors are committed to strengthening the bicultural programme across the network. Recently distributed resources, links with local marae and sharing of local stories and waiata are supporting the emergence of a place-based curriculum. Continuing to build bicultural practice remains a priority. Programme tutors have identified that better understanding strategies that promote educational success for MƒÅori children is a next step. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>Many children in the service are infants and toddlers. Thoughtful placement with educators responds to the needs of individual children and their families. Programme tutors work positively alongside educators to provide a curriculum that effectively promotes learning for this age group.</p><p>Provision for children requiring additional learning support is well considered. Programme tutors assist educators to work with external agencies and families to fulfil the needs of these children.</p><p>Educators are well supported through regular visits and communication with programme tutors. This contact provides a balance of ensuring expectations and compliance requirements are met and for ongoing guidance for education and care. Programme tutors model good practice and build the capability of educators as professionals. The team works collaboratively to provide a consistent approach to educators' ongoing development.</p><p>Educators regularly record day-to-day activities and children‚Äôs involvement in the programme. They are shown how to identify learning and links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Programme tutors have identified that planning for children‚Äôs learning across the network is variable. PORSE has recently developed tools to better support understanding of the process. It is timely to undertake further work to identify priorities for children‚Äôs learning, aligned to the PORSE philosophy and local contexts. A continued focus on strengthening educators' planning should promote a curriculum responsive to the child, their context and that extends their learning.</p><p>A well organised governance and management framework guides operation and practice. Streamlining of systems and processes in relation to quality assurance is improving the accountability and monitoring of educator practice. There is an increased focus on achieving consistency across all networks. The curriculum and quality assurance coach has begun to identify and action ways to progress this.</p><p>An appropriate appraisal process encourages programme tutors' professional growth and development. Further unpacking the <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession</em> should enable programme tutors to gain a better understanding of what good quality evidence looks like in the home-based context.</p><p>PORSE values self review as a tool to promote improvement. Coaches and programme tutors are beginning to explore the purpose and use of internal evaluation to gain a deeper understanding of how their practice impacts on outcomes for children. Building an understanding of effective internal evaluation at all levels of the organisation is a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that the key next steps are for programme tutors to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase understanding of strategies that promote success for MƒÅori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>PORSE should also continue to develop the understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Hawke's Bay Q2 completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>19 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
