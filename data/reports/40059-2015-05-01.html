</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Darlings Childcare centre is situated in the western suburbs of Rotorua and provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age group setting. The centre is licensed for up to 28 children including 8 under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, all children enrolled identified as being of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>In response to ERO‚Äôs 2012 review findings the centre has been working with an external provider to deliver professional learning and development for teachers through the Ministry of Education, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) programme. Through this initiative, the centre has developed an annual plan focused on strengthening effective childcare and education, marketing, human resources, management and leadership. In addition, an external mentor has been engaged to provide advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers. In June 2014 the centre relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner and staff have benefitted from the guidance and support of the SELO programme. As a result of this programme a useful annual plan has provided motivation and positive direction for centre development. A positive next step for centre staff is to fully realise the intent of this plan. This plan should also be used as a basis for ongoing self review and to further identify strategic goals and priorities.</p><p>Through the programme of advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers a culture of teacher reflection is being fostered. The programme mentor provides regular constructive feedback that is influencing positive change to centre practices.</p><p>The centre owner has a clearly expressed vision for developing confident, articulate and caring tamariki who are happy and healthy in mind and body. This vision underpins the centre‚Äôs curriculum and teachers‚Äô practice. ERO observed interactions where teachers listen to children, respect their ideas and foster their interests through responsive resourcing and conversations.</p><p>The language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children is valued and promoted through assessment practice, the programme and teachers‚Äô interactions. Children enjoy the many opportunities to participate in cultural experiences such as haka, waiata, karakia and pepeha. Children take pride in sharing some of these practices with whƒÅnau at home.</p><p>Teachers have developed records of children's development and learning that strongly reflect interests, capabilities and learning dispositions of individual children. Teachers value and respond to parents‚Äô ideas and aspirations for their children. Parents are increasingly contributing to assessment and planning for their own children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and ERO agree the following areas are important priorities for the centre:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing and refocusing the annual plan to ensure ongoing centre development</li>
<li>continued development and implementation of a documented appraisal process including teacher goals and training plans</li>
<li>development and implementation of planned self review for enhancing aspects of the curriculum and teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The Ministry of Education continue to support the centre to review, refocus and monitor the implementation of the centre‚Äôs strategic direction and annual plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Darlings Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Darlings Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer¬†Northern</p><p>1 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
