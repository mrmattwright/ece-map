<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Finlayson Kindergarten is very well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Finlayson Park Kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). The Association&rsquo;s clear vision sets the direction for the service. Strategies to achieve this vision include responsiveness to wh&#257;nau contributions and bicultural practices. The Association has a commitment to high quality care and education.</p><p>The kindergarten provides five morning and three afternoon sessions. Children attend from the local community and the majority will attend the school next door. Children represent a number of cultures and are aged between two and five years of age.</p><p>The kindergarten has had a positive ERO reporting history with the 2010 report affirming high quality programmes. Programmes support children to be capable, confident learners, able to articulate their ideas and thoughts and to work effectively with other children and adults. The kindergarten has three qualified teachers.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Kindergarten is well governed and managed. Professional support for the well qualified team of registered teachers is ongoing and useful. Specific initiatives and personnel in both the Association and the kindergarten promote te reo me &#333;na tikanga M&#257;ori and are strengthening children&rsquo;s understanding about te ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>Teachers base the learning programmes on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Their goals for children are clearly linked to their teaching and learning statement and visible in their practices. Teachers&rsquo; teamwork is based on using each other&rsquo;s strengths to provide the best for children and their community. The reflective culture they have established is having a positive effect on the quality of children&rsquo;s learning, and their sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Relationships between teachers, children and their families are respectful, and welcoming. Wh&#257;nau hui are held regularly in the kindergarten and are well attended. Social events at the kindergarten, and excursions with children to which wh&#257;nau are invited, further cement relationships and contribute to children&rsquo;s sense of belonging.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s gardens provide a link to children&rsquo;s home lives, and an opportunity for them to share their knowledge and act as tutors. These opportunities create a sense of children being part of a learning community.</p><p>Children are highly independent and make use of all resources and opportunities made available to them. Teachers challenge children&rsquo;s thinking, and invite them to take learning risks through positive support and encouragement. Children are eager to participate and are proud of their achievements. They are relaxed and trusting, and enjoy tuakana/teina relationships with their peers. The tone in the kindergarten is settled and calm.</p><p>Bicultural practices are well established and guide the programme, the choice of resources and the displays in the environment. Professional development has supported teachers&rsquo; confidence in integrating M&#257;ori ways of knowing, being and doing into the programme for children. They recognise their need to keep building their knowledge in this area.</p><p>Teachers also include a strong focus on representing the cultural backgrounds of Pacific, Chinese, Indian and P&#257;keh&#257; children who attend. Highly inclusive practices make provision for children with diverse needs. Teachers successfully model inclusion for children.</p><p>The Association&rsquo;s professional practice manager (PPM) team leads teachers in ongoing reflection on the quality of the kindergarten practices. Teachers recognise the need to continue to develop planning and assessment practices, and deepen self-review processes. They are well positioned to continue developing self review processes that inform their practices.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Finlayson Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>18 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
