</table><p>Scenicland Preschool is becoming well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scenicland Preschool and Nursery operates from a large purpose-built facility in Hokitika. The centre caters for children in three separate areas. The nursery area is for children up to two-years of age. It has a separate indoor area which allows children to easily interact with teachers and children of a similar age. The toddler and preschool spaces have separate indoor areas and a shared spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>Since the 2013 review there have been changes in centre leadership and a very recent change in centre ownership. These changes are bringing about a more structured management approach and coherent procedures. The centre is being closely supported by an area manager. The centre has also been participating in a Ministry of Education professional development initiatives. This has had a positive impact particularly in self review, assessment and planning. There have been some changes to the learning environment and learning resources to support better outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The teachers are qualified early childhood teachers or training to become early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in the areas of development identified in the last report in 2013.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>All children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. They experience respectful, caring and nurturing relationships with teachers. Children relate well to each other.</p><p>Children are provided with an interesting range of learning activities and have easy access to a wide variety of resources. Their choices are respected and they follow their interests within the programme.</p><p>Teachers involve themselves in children‚Äôs play. They play alongside children and use teaching approaches that support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Recent developments with children‚Äôs individual planning and assessments effectively recognise and respond to their individual interests and areas for learning.</p><p>Regular reflections and discussions by teachers about how to improve aspects of the programme are beginning to improve outcomes for children. An extensive philosophy review involved all staff and included detailed data gathering. This model will be a useful guide for future reviews.</p><p>Teachers are now seeking parents' ideas and opinions. They are making increasing use of this information to develop more meaningful partnerships with parents to support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Since the last review, a new centre manager has been appointed. She is fostering greater shared leadership and making better use of staff strengths.</p><p>Teachers are increasing their awareness of bicultural practices. They have developed a:</p><ul>
<li>greater understanding of some MƒÅori values and what these look like in the programme</li>
<li>relationship with the local bi-cultural unit at the local primary school</li>
<li>greater understanding of how they reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are also making good use of people in the community to help them to strengthen bicultural aspects of the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the ways teachers extend children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills, and evaluating the effectiveness of their teaching strategies</li>
<li>successfully implementing the new and more robust appraisal system</li>
<li>implementing a well-managed process to support the development of a new group planning system that is well understood by all teachers</li>
<li>continuing to monitor the consistency of individual assessment and planning and ensuring children‚Äôs cultural identities are reflected in assessment</li>
<li>increasing all teachers‚Äô understandings of evaluation for improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scenicland Pre School and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>18 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
