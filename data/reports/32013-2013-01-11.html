<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waihi Beach Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waihi Beach Playcentre is a family cooperative, early childhood service where parents and children learn and play alongside one another. The centre is located in the coastal township of Waihi Beach, has close links with the neighbouring school and is well supported by the community. It provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age. It operates under the umbrella of the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association (TVCPA) affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review, there were 26 children on the roll, including 9 children under two years of age. The centre operates for two morning sessions a week, and one afternoon session for older children led by a paid supervisor.</p><p>Many parents are undertaking training in playcentre course work and they use their skills and knowledge to fulfil centre roles and responsibilities. Effective succession planning ensures that the centre is well led by long-serving members.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that it will provide quality environment, experiences and interactions to enrich the lives of preschoolers. It has developed into a centre where families are growing together, 'wh&#257;nau tupu ng&#257;tahi.'</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in five early childhood education services within the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><p>A liaison officer visits each centre twice a term and provides regular support and feedback to parents. The association is currently reviewing and restructuring its governance and management roles to more effectively support centres in promoting positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in a safe, inclusive and supportive environment. Parents follow children's lead, and help them to sustain their interest and engagement in the various areas of play. Following the recent refurbishment of the indoor environment, resources and equipment are now easily accessible to children. They are able to revisit their learning in centre displays, and in their portfolios, which are available to them. Parents are responsive to the different needs of children in mixed-age settings, including provision for babies and toddlers. A designated session offering further enrichment and extension for older children is run by an experienced supervisor. Parents use a range of strategies and guidelines that ensure shared understandings about learning, play and behaviour. Children are confident and articulate, and interact positively with other children and adults.</p><p>Parents are using planning processes that identify the strengths and interests of individual children. These are documented at session evaluations and displayed in learning stories, in children's profile books, and individual profiles on centre walls. A challenge now is for parents to identify and record children's learning and progress in the learning stories.</p><p>The programme provides children with many opportunities to learn and play in a stimulating and well-resourced environment. Good use is made of the local community to enhance and extend children's learning. ERO and parents agree that a next step is to further increase te reo and tikanga Maori in the centre.</p><p>Centre leaders are using self review effectively to bring about improvement and ensure centre sustainability. They question and reflect on how to overcome challenges and enhance opportunities for children. Committed parents are resourceful in the ways that they use expertise within the local community, and the knowledge and skills of long-standing members, to enhance outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre leaders have adapted the TVCPA strategic goals to reflect their local context. Parents use the goals to guide their practice and regularly reflect on the progress they are making. Centre leaders are well supported by the umbrella organisation and draw on a range of external expertise and knowledge in early childhood education.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waihi Beach Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
