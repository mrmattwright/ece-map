</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Treasure Hunt Montessori Preschool is a privately owned service. It provides sessional and all day education and care for up to 50 children, including up 18 children under two years of age, in two separate rooms known as the nursery and preschool.</p><p>Most children at the centre are of Indian descent with smaller numbers of children who come from a range of ethnicities including PƒÅkehƒÅ, MƒÅori and Chinese. Teachers reflect the cultures of the children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is underpinned by the principles of Montessori and influenced by<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It focuses on providing children with a rich learning programme that includes opportunities to pursue their own interests.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted positive relationships, the relevant programme and well organised learning environments. These areas continue to be noteworthy. The 2013 ERO report also identified some areas for improvement and these continue to be priorities for future centre development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy, friendly and settled. Teachers' interactions with children are affirming and respectful, and children demonstrate a good sense of belonging. Older children are keen learners and their independence is well promoted. Children with special educational needs are appropriately supported.</p><p>Teachers' responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments. It would now be beneficial for children if teachers reviewed the learning environment to determine the kinds of resources that would best enhance children‚Äôs opportunities to follow their own ideas, interests and exploration.</p><p>Children in the preschool area are offered a choice of activities in an appropriately resourced Montessori learning environment. Staff use deliberate acts of teaching and provide opportunities for children to make sense of the natural, physical, social and material world. Project work fosters children's social learning skills. Opportunities to foster reading, writing and mathematical knowledge are an integral part of everyday activities. Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted play where their ideas and social interactions can develop.</p><p>Project-based planning is clearly documented in the preschool area and includes some recognition of children's interests. Learning records, however, are not being regularly documented, and managers acknowledge the importance of seeking external help to review planning, assessment and evaluation processes. Increasing the focus on documenting and responding to children's interests is an area for development.</p><p>New staff have been appointed recently. Both rooms have head teachers, with one of them being very new to the role. It could be useful to revisit the service's philosophy with the staff to identify and prioritise what is important for children and families. The centre owner believes it would also be timely to review aspects of governance, management and curriculum in order to develop shared understandings and expectations in the centre about these matters.</p><p>Good use is made of external mentors to provide a programme of advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers. The centre owner should now seek external support to review the service's current appraisal process and align it more closely to the <em>Practising Teaching Criteria</em>.</p><p>It would be useful to review the roles and responsibilities of managers and staff. Developing clear and specific job descriptions could distribute leadership opportunities and be helpful in further developing governance, management and curriculum processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers have identified key next steps for the centre that include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formalising systems, guidelines and documentation that support long-term planning, policy development and centre operations, such as appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a regular cycle of self-review, including evaluation that is effective and focused on ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering how a bicultural curriculum and celebration of children's diverse cultures can enrich the centre's programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seeking external support to review planning, assessment and evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Treasure Hunt Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Treasure Hunt Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:¬†</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education¬†</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
