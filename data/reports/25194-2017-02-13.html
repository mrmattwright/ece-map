</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Howick is licensed for 47 children, including eight under two years of age. It provides sessional and all-day education and care for children from its increasingly diverse multicultural community.</p><p>The centre is part of the national BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres. A centre manager and head teacher provide leadership and are supported by the BestStart professional services (PSM) and business managers (BM). Registered teachers in each room are supported by unqualified staff. The centre employs a cook and an administrator.</p><p>The centre is in a converted historic homestead close to Howick Village in East Auckland. Children transition from the nursery room to the preschool room at approximately two years of age. Each of the two age groups has access to large outdoor areas.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and recognises the value of learning though play. It indicates that programmes will be based on a bicultural curriculum that caters for the centre's diversity.</p><p>There have been several new staff since the 2013 ERO review, including the centre manager, head teacher and several teachers. The current PSM and BM are also new to this centre. There has been significant roll growth.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified many strengths, including opportunities for children to learn through play. The report identified some areas for development, including building leadership and evaluation capacity and strengthening parents' engagement. While there has been progress, the current centre managers recognise that children will benefit from further work in these areas. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They confidently engage with other children and staff and with the activities set up by teachers. Children have time to engage in sustained play.</p><p>Teachers are respectful in their interactions with children and their families. They work alongside children, extending their play through conversations and helping them resource their activities.</p><p>Teachers observe children to identify their current learning dispositions and use this information to plan for the programme. They prepare activities that support learning related to centre or community events. Older children help make decisions about how the environment is set up and the resources that will support their play.</p><p>Infants are well cared for. Their teachers interact with them in ways that promote their sense of belonging and support their language development. The new teaching team is reviewing provision for the younger age group and have already made changes to the environment and the programme. Centre managers could continue to evaluate the programme to ensure that it is responsive to individual children's developmental needs and interests.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher have a shared understanding of quality teaching and learning and model good practices. They provide effective feedback to teachers to support ongoing improvement. They are building leadership capacity within the centre with the intention of having staff contribute more to decision making.</p><p>Parents are having greater input into their children's assessment. Electronic communication from staff about their children's education is encouraging parents to comment regularly. This helps teachers to know more about the children during their time outside the centre. Centre managers have identified planning and assessment as an area that they want to continue to strengthen.</p><p>Parents are becoming increasingly involved in contributing to centre decision-making and the educational programme. They are consulted through surveys and discussions. Teachers encourage parents to share their aspirations for their children as learners, so that they can include these in the programme planning.</p><p>BestStart has useful systems for monitoring centre operations. These include regular management meetings and an internal audit process (QEC), which is used to identify challenges and develop plans for improvement. In addition, the centre has a strategic plan that is linked to the BestStart vision and strategic plan, as well as the centre's philosophy statement, an annual management plan and QEC action plans for each room.</p><p>Centre leaders regularly reflect on aspects of how the centre is run and how well it supports children's learning. They have a good framework for guiding more formal reviews. The centre's internal evaluation process would be strengthened through more evaluative questions to guide the process. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that the next key steps for the centre include strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of the education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the programme and the environment for infants, to better reflect their ages and stages of development and their individual routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership capacity within the staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural aspects of the curriculum for the older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Howick completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>BestStart has plans to upgrade the outdoor area of ABC Howick. In the meantime it is important that general maintenance is ongoing to ensure that hazards are well managed or eliminated. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Howick will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
