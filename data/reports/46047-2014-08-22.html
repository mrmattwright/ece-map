</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Next Generation Birkenhead is a newly established centre on Auckland‚Äôs North Shore. It is one of three early childhood centres operated by the owner and her family. Other centres in this group are Next Generation Under 2s and Next Generation Over 2s. All three centres are in close proximity to each other in the Birkenhead area.</p><p>This centre is licensed to provide education and care for up to 50 children including 20 up to two years of age. Many children attend this centre fulltime and their families have long term relationships with the organisation.</p><p>Children are catered for in two age-related groups within a refurbished house and purpose-built facility. The infants and toddlers are provided for in the house. Older children are also able to access this space. The two buildings are connected by a shared outdoor area where children can play together as a mixed age group. The owners have established well appointed and attractive environments.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on providing an environment that nurtures children‚Äôs sense of security and trust, and promotes their exploration. Teachers plan to support children‚Äôs social, emotional, physical and intellectual development.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging to the centre and to their particular rooms. They play well alongside and with each other. Children talk freely with their peers and with adults about their play and their ideas.</p><p>Children readily access the outdoor areas to create their own play experiences. They confidently explore and take on physical challenges in the well planned playground. Children respect and consider the needs of other children when playing in the mixed age group.</p><p>Infants and toddlers form close bonds with their teachers. Teachers establish warm and respectful relationships with the children in their care. As a result infants and toddlers are settled and comfortable. They play and explore the environment at their own pace. Care routines preferred by parents are acknowledged and followed.</p><p>Teachers work closely and respectfully with children. They encourage and support children to direct their own play. Teachers respond to children‚Äôs individual needs and interests. Teachers question children appropriately to provoke and extend their thinking and vocabulary. This helps children to be confident and active learners.</p><p>Teachers observe children‚Äôs play and identify children‚Äôs emerging interests. They work together to plan for opportunities and activities that support children to build on these interests. Teachers evaluate the effectiveness of the children‚Äôs learning experiences and they identify ways in which children‚Äôs interests can be revisited and extended.</p><p>Teachers record children‚Äôs involvement in learning opportunities in individual portfolios. These records identify the learning that has occurred and in some cases the developmental stages achieved. Teachers share the children‚Äôs learning stories with parents through individual blogs. They use information and communication technologies (ICT) to keep in touch with parents and for children to communicate between rooms.</p><p>Teachers are continuing to build their knowledge of te reo MƒÅori and their capacity to share this with children. A teacher provides leadership and good support for colleagues in this area.</p><p>Centre managers employ a teacher to lead professional development for teachers. The use of ICT has been the focus of recent professional development. She works closely with individual teachers to help them reflect on their practice and fulfils a middle management role within the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>During the review ERO and centre managers discussed areas for future growth and development. ERO endorses centre managers‚Äô plans to promote ongoing improvement by:</p><ul>
<li>providing greater educational leadership to help teachers provide quality learning opportunities for children</li>
<li>ensuring consistency of high-quality teaching practice across the centre</li>
<li>refining self review processes, including ways to seek and respond to parent voice</li>
<li>considering ways to build teachers‚Äô knowledge of, and confidence in implementing, bicultural practices</li>
<li>exploring ways that access to a rich variety of resources can extend and engage older children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Next Generation Birkenhead completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Next Generation Birkenhead will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>22 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
