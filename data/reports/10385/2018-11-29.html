</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Remuera is licensed to provide education and care for up to 70 children, including up to 20 children under two years of age. Most children at the centre are from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre operates out of a renovated villa that has a split level. The top level is for children from two years up to school age and the lower level, with its own separate playground, is for infants and toddlers. Each room has a head teacher and other qualified and registered teachers. The majority of teachers are new to the centre since the last ERO review. A cook works on site providing meals for children.</p><p>The centre's philosophy espouses child-focused and nurturing teaching and learning approaches that are based on whƒÅnau aspirations. It highlights the importance of celebrating cultural diversity and identifies the centre's key values that include whakawhanaungatanga, aroha and whakamana.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted that teachers provided programmes that were stimulating and supported children's interests and strengths. These positive features have been maintained. Teachers have engaged in professional development in planning, assessment and internal evaluation. They have strengthened bicultural practices and developed good relationships with the local community and schools.</p><p>The centre is one of the BestStart Education and Care Centres. The BestStart organisation provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support the operation and curriculum development in individual centres. A Business Manager and a Professional Services Manager are highly involved in the professional development of staff, and strategic guidance.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the BestStart Auckland - Upper North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm relationships and respectful interactions underpin the programme, and contribute to a calm and welcoming tone. Children's play is purposeful and sustains high levels of engagement in tasks or activities. They are aware of the routines of the day.</p><p>Tuakana/teina approaches with older children supporting younger children are encouraged. Centre leaders are keen to further develop team expectations in bicultural practices. They could now embed and implement bicultural goals in all areas of the curriculum.</p><p>Infants receive respectful, individualised care, and toddlers' growing independence is nurtured and their preferences affirmed. Transition processes into, through and beyond the centre are well managed and support whƒÅnau and child readiness for leaning.</p><p>Children are confident, and play cooperatively with each other and adults. They have a strong sense of belonging and show care and consideration for others. Children have good opportunities to make choices about their play. Teachers support them to develop science, literacy and mathematics skills and concepts in the well-resourced environment. Children explore the environment and are curious about the natural world. Children are capable, competent and sociable learners.</p><p>Teachers support children's play well and extend children‚Äôs skills and knowledge in a variety of learning areas. They provide a balance between structured and child-initiated play. Children‚Äôs independence and self-management skills are valued and fostered.</p><p>Well-established management practices, positive relationships with parents/whƒÅnau and teachers' culturally responsive practice continue to be reflected in centre practices and procedures. Centre leaders and teachers value parental and community involvement. Parents/whƒÅnau receive good information about their child‚Äôs learning and development. They are encouraged to contribute to the centre programme and join in centre events.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a strong commitment to social justice, equity and the centre philosophy. Ongoing teacher development is valued and supported by a relevant appraisal system. Internal evaluation is well-established and influences decision making. It has been identified by leaders as an area to continue strengthening.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by the shared vision, and strategic and annual planning. These are linked to the strategic goals of the BestStart organisation. The process of linking the centre's strategic plan to the organisation's plan is promoting teachers' recognition that they belong to a wider learning community. This is supporting more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Continued revisiting of the centre's strategic and annual planning goals is enabling leaders and teachers to monitor practice quality and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening teacher understanding of practice shifts needed to implement <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adding more depth, complexity and continuity to child-led learning and making this visible in centre documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a more collaborative approach to evaluation that involves deeper analysis of the impact of teacher practice on children's outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing assessment and planning processes to show how children‚Äôs individual interests are noticed, responded to, and extended over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Remuera completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Remuera will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>29 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
