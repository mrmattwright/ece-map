</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Kaiapoi provides individualised education and care for 85 children from birth to school age, 25 of whom are under two years old. Children learn in well-resourced, purpose-built environments. These consist of five classrooms and three connecting outdoor areas: one shared by infants and toddlers, one shared by two and three-year-olds and one for four-year-old children.</p><p>The service has a stable leadership team consisting of four head teachers, one for each area, and a centre manager. Recently, children in two of the areas have experienced staff changes. Nearly all teachers are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Since the October 2013 ERO review report, the managers and staff have strengthened planning and assessment and the use of internal evaluation to improve the quality of learning and teaching. Individual teachers are developing their use and understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori. This is an area identified by ERO as needing further development across the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ABC Kaiapoi is a warm and welcoming place for children and their families/whānau. Teachers know the children well. They build strong and trusting relationships with children and their families and whānau. They model care and respect, and support children to develop friendships and social skills. They are deepening their partnerships with parents and seeking ways to give families and whānau a greater say in key aspects of the service. Centre leaders intend to develop this further, especially seeking and responding to all parents' wishes for their children's learning.</p><p>Children in all areas of the service experience environments for learning that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>are calm and settled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have ample space and resources and free-flow between indoor and outdoor play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are flexible and responsive to children's needs, especially for those who stay for long days.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from playing and learning in small groups and individualised care routines. Their teachers have close nurturing relationships with them and are responsive to their verbal and non-verbal cues.</p><p>A strength of the service is the careful thought given to transitions into the centre and on to school. These are well managed and support the wellbeing of parents and children.</p><p>Children take part in a programme of care and learning that has a wide range of interesting experiences relevant for children of all ages. Children's individual goals are clearly visible in each classroom. Teachers use these to decide what to provide in addition to the core programme. Leaders have identified that the next step is for each room to determine key priorities for all children's learning and use these to inform programme provision and assessment practices.</p><p>Leaders have identified that developing guidelines for effective assessment may help with greater consistency of practice. They have been strengthening assessment practices, and providing mentoring and peer support for new teachers.</p><p>There is a strategic goal to develop meaningful understanding and development of the centre's bicultural curriculum. Some teachers are undertaking professional learning. This is an area for further development.</p><p>The centre manager is fostering and developing collaborative teamwork. She is building shared leadership amongst her team. They are motivated to keep improving teaching practice and, with the support of the professional service manager, are deepening their understanding of internal evaluation. They should continue to build teachers' confidence with this.</p><p>The philosophy states the shared beliefs of the service. When this is reviewed, it should also include the agreed desired learning outcomes for their children. This should include key Māori values that are important in the centre. The strategic plan outlines key priorities for the service. The centre manager acknowledges that making better use of this will help her prioritise her workload and maintain a focus on development.</p><p>There are well-developed systems and processes in place to help achieve BestStart's expectations for high quality education and care. This includes regular monitoring and support for the quality of practice, identifying what is going well and what the centre needs to do next to improve. Professional learning is promoted at all levels of the organisation. A strengthened appraisal system leading to greater in-depth reflection is in place and would be further enhanced by making links to Tātaiako (cultural competencies). The centre manager needs to ensure that this process is embedded.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the key steps for improving outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop systems that support consistently high quality planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to deepen teacher understanding of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarify the service's desired outcomes for children and ensure these are embedded in key documents, such as the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop bicultural practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Kaiapoi completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Kaiapoi will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>8 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
