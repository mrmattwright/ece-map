</table><p>Aspects of centre leadership, management and governance need to significantly improve.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children from birth-to-school age attend Kew Pacific Island ECE Centre. Most are of MƒÅori and Cook Island ethnicity. Some European and other Pacific children attend. The centre was set up to nurture the language and culture of its children. Presently, the centre is within the New River School grounds.</p><p>The centre is part of the Pacific Island Advisory and Cultural Trust (PIACT) in Invercargill. The supervisor is responsible for day-to-day management and she reports to the trust. The past trust manager regularly met with and supported the supervisor in her role. Recently, a new manager has been appointed.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, there has been little change in the teaching team. The Ministry of Education (MOE) has supported the centre with ongoing professional learning. With external help, the centre has made good progress in addressing some of the recommendations in ERO‚Äôs 2011 report. Some areas require further work. These and other areas are outlined in this report as key next steps.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><h4>Teaching and Learning</h4><p>Children settle quickly on arrival and confidently interact with their teachers. Many have developed good friendships with other children. Infants and toddlers play alongside older children for part of the day but also have a special area with age-appropriate resources.</p><p>ERO observed caring and gentle relationships between the teachers and children. Teachers support children as they arrive to find friends to play with and activities to join in. The centre environment includes displays and resources that reflect the children‚Äôs heritage. Through the day, teachers occasionally use te reo MƒÅori and Cook Island MƒÅori. The use of these languages could be increased.</p><p>Children have regular opportunities to enjoy Pacific song and dance and early-literacy experiences, such as sharing books and exploring letters and numbers. Teachers often introduce new activities and resources into the programme. They sensitively support children to develop social skills, such as turn taking and sharing. Some mathematical learning is included in play or at group time.</p><p>Some teachers are skilful in the way they engage children in conversation, listen carefully, ask open questions and add depth to children‚Äôs thinking and play. These teachers are alert to other children nearby and find ways to involve them.</p><p>Teachers have benefitted from extensive professional learning. This has resulted in:</p><ul>
<li>more thorough assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>better understanding and use of self review to identify what practices could be improved.</li>
</ul><p>Detailed individual learning plans have been developed. Teachers vary in their confidence in assessing and planning for individual children. In better examples, records include parents‚Äô views about their child‚Äôs learning. They also identify significant new learning, how teachers supported this and how they will further extend the child.</p><p>The centre environment needs improving. In some areas, such as the family-play corner and the outside area, children need more inviting and varied resources. This is particularly so for the outside covered area. Resources should be more accessible to children. Teachers have worked creatively within these limitations, sometimes going out of their way to bring additional resources from home.</p><h4>Governance and Leadership</h4><p>There is a lack of clarity around the roles and responsibility between the trust, the manager and the centre supervisor. There is also a poor flow of information between the trust and the centre. Critical information is sometimes not shared.</p><p>The strategic plans that describe the centre‚Äôs priorities are not widely known, and not well implemented or reported against. The annual plan does not align well to strategic planning. As a result, it is hard to see purposeful action, management and leadership leading to improvement.</p><p>The trust needs to place a much stronger emphasis on children‚Äôs learning and how it resources that learning. There is inadequate understanding and transparency about the use of MOE funding, including equity funding.</p><p>Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed. However, these reviews need to look more carefully at day-to-day practices to check that these align with each policy or procedure.</p><p>Staff members work well as a team and show a strong commitment to their work with children. The appraisal system has been improved. However, this does not include observations of teacher practices and could have a stronger focus on professional learning and improvement.</p><p>ERO has concerns about leadership capacity within the centre. Improvements have been externally driven. Some teachers‚Äô strengths could be better used to assist the centre to move forward.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>maintaining and building on recent changes to planning and assessment for individual children</li>
<li>helping all teachers to extend individual children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>strengthening group planning so that it more explicitly shows the strategies teachers will use to support small and large-group learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager should continue to build teachers‚Äô understanding and use of self review as a tool for improvement.</p><p>ERO recommends that the trust and centre work with the MOE to review and improve:</p><ul>
<li>the centre environment, including resources to support children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>leadership capacity, implementation of policy and procedure review and teachers‚Äô appraisal processes</li>
<li>the usefulness and implementation of strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>the clarity of governance and management roles, responsibilities and systems</li>
<li>budget planning, allocation and reporting.</li>
</ul><p>The trust and the centre supervisor need to ensure that they consistently share information necessary for the smooth running of the centre. The supervisor should provide detailed reports to the trust regarding all aspects of centre operation and requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kew Pacific Island ECE Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for Compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to:</p><ul>
<li>not providing information to parents about how MOE funding, including equity funding, is spent</li>
<li>not having an annual budget plan to guide financial expenditure.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA3 and GMA9.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kew Pacific Island ECE Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>10 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
