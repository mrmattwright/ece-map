</table><p>Kauri Kids Glenfield¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Glenfield is located in the Glenfield Leisure Centre. It is licensed for 30 children, including up to 10 children under the age of two years. The facility offers a variety of full-day, sessional and casual attendance options. It provides for mixed-age play, and has a separate area for infants and toddlers. The head teacher leads a mostly qualified staff team.</p><p>Kauri Kids Glenfield is one of 11 early childhood education (ECE) centres across the wider Auckland region managed centrally by Auckland Council. Kauri Kids Auckland Council Management (KKACM), provides a governance and management framework, and support personnel to assist the centre. An ECE curriculum leader is responsible for the overall operations of the Kauri Kids services. The head teacher in each service reports to the manager of the facility where the service is based.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy of all Kauri Kids centres emphasises the organisation's commitment to providing a service that values quality learning experiences and opportunities for exploration, the inclusion of all children and their families, and the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers continue the good quality practices noted in ERO's 2015 report. Since 2015, there have been staff and leadership changes. A new head teacher has been appointed. Teachers have engaged in professional learning and development to improve teaching practices. They have made significant improvements to the learning environment.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Auckland City Kauri Kids organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide an attractive and welcoming learning environment. The small outdoor area is carefully organised and equipped to support active play. Well-resourced and interesting areas invite and support children‚Äôs engagement in play. Regular access to the leisure centre‚Äôs facilities, including the gym and local park areas, provide extra opportunities for children to be physically active.</p><p>Children engage in sustained play, have fun, and are enthusiastic learners. They learn at a relaxed pace, are able to make choices, and problem solve. Children's creativity and imagination are valued. Teachers encourage children to use literacy, mathematics and science as part of their play. Children are confident and capable learners.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing, individualised care. The dignity of the child is maintained and routines are sensitively managed. Toddlers‚Äô growing independence and language skills are fostered in play and conversations. They show a strong sense of belonging and security, and are able to explore and make discoveries.</p><p>Effective and inclusive teaching practices affirm and build on children's strengths. Children with additional needs are well supported. Relationships are based on a culture of care and respect for children and their whƒÅnau. Teachers acknowledge children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds and include diverse home languages in greetings and conversations. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are increasingly included in aspects of the programme, and teachers are keen to further develop in this area. Transitions into the centre and on to school are responsive to individual children‚Äôs and whƒÅnau needs.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement a play-based learning programme that reflects the centre's philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The programme is influenced by current theories and research. Assessment and planning is responsive to children‚Äôs interests and is displayed for children to revisit. Parents/whƒÅnau are kept informed through frequent informal discussions, electronic communications and attractive wall displays. Online assessment portfolios allow parents and other family members to follow their children's learning progress.</p><p>The leadership team has a strong focus on continual development. Leaders support team members to develop their leadership capability. Teacher appraisals are aligned with the centre's strategic goals and required teaching standards. Teachers' professional learning is impacting positively on outcomes for children.</p><p>Well-developed strategic plans and annual plans guide centre operations. Health and safety, and employment policies align with Auckland Council expectations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to enrich bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more consistently documenting how individual children‚Äôs interests and dispositions are developed to a deeper level, and how progress is evaluated over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exploring ways for children to lead their own learning through more complex and challenging play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the documentation of internal evaluation to more clearly show teachers' evaluative thinking and resulting outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The KKACM operations manager and centre leaders agree that, across the organisation, they should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice in all centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal systems, to meet Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation through more evaluative questioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, programme planning and evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Glenfield completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
