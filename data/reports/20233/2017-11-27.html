</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Albany, located next to Westfield Mall in Albany, offers full day and sessional education and care. It is licensed for 58 children including 20 under 2 years of age. Children attending the centre reflect the diverse and multicultural groups in the local community.</p><p>Children play in two age-specific spaces in the facility. Clear windows and small outdoor fences help to maintain a visual connection between the two areas. The centre is led by a centre manager and head teachers, and has a well-established team of teachers.</p><p>The recently reviewed centre philosophy acknowledges children's capability. It also emphasises incorporating bicultural practices in the programme, and celebrating the multicultural diversity of the learning community.</p><p>The centre has responded well to recommendations in the 2014 ERO report. Significant improvements have been made to the outdoor environment. The infants' playground offers an open and inviting space. Additional physical challenges for children have been incorporated into the recently upgraded outdoor area.</p><p>The BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight centres in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for, and have formed strong bonds, with their teachers. They explore their environment confidently, and enjoy their play in an inviting and well-resourced space. Children benefit from a calm, supportive and unrushed pace. Teachers work alongside children, nurturing their language and curiosity. Well-positioned photos connect children to home and family, and celebrate children's cultural identity.</p><p>Older children are settled, confident, and friendly. Teachers are welcoming, and view children as capable and competent learners. They work closely with children, engaging them in conversation, supporting play, and fostering children's independence.</p><p>Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play. They select from a range of man-made and natural resources in a calm, inviting space. Children play cooperatively, are respectful of their environment, and have a strong sense of belonging. Their cultural identities are celebrated in their portfolios and in wall displays.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively, communicating and responding to children's preferences and needs. They offer learning experiences that encourage the children to inquire and explore. Children of all ages benefit from having a key teacher. Teachers are caring and responsive using inclusive practices to ensure children with special needs are supported.</p><p>Transitions between classrooms are tailored to suit the child, in consultation with parents. Staff from the two rooms work together to ensure smooth and successful transitions between home and the centre, and within the centre. Children are also well supported to transition to school.</p><p>The programme aligns with the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers notice, recognise, and respond to children's emerging interests. Teachers are deepening their knowledge of planning and assessment. Teachers could further challenge older children and extend their learning, and make this evident in activities and documentation.</p><p>Parents receive useful information about their child's learning progress, including from an online tool. They can also access and contribute to their child's learning experiences, and share these with their wider family.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives are integrated into learning experiences. Good leadership from team members has strengthened te ao MƒÅori teaching practices. Individual portfolios reflect how children's cultures and languages are valued and integrated into the curriculum. Wall displays showcase children's and teachers' pepeha.</p><p>Leaders have worked hard to build a strong team culture, and this is evident in the way team members interact and respond to each other. The centre provides good opportunities for teachers to develop as leaders. Leaders and teachers have strengthened internal evaluation, and are continuing to refine practices. This is enabling teams to make informed decisions, and plan ongoing improvement.</p><p>BestStart supports teachers‚Äô professional growth, through relevant and ongoing professional learning. The organisation continues to review its appraisal systems, which encourage teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practice.</p><p>Sound governance systems guide centre operations. The Professional Services Manager (PSM) and the Business Manager conduct internal audits, and regularly share quality assurance reports that identify strengths and suggested improvements. Centre staff use internal evaluation to review aspects of centre operations, and would benefit from support to further strengthen their evaluation practices.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs strategic plan is linked to the BestStart vision and its strategic plan, which is currently under review. Centre goals will be aligned with BestStart strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and PSM agree the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using teaching strategies that extend the complexity of play for older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting intentional teaching strategies to show children's extended learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining internal evaluation to focus on the impact of teaching practice on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>BestStart managers have identified the need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue developing BestStart strategic goals to provide a clearer guide for centre development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine appraisal systems by focusing on professional collaboration and 'teaching as inquiry'.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Albany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Albany will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>27 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
