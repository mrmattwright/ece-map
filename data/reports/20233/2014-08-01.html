</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Albany offers full day education and care for children from six weeks to school age. The centre is situated on the perimeter of the Westfield Albany shopping mall. The centre‚Äôs roll reflects its multicultural community and includes six children of MƒÅori descent and one with Pacific heritage. Since the 2011 ERO review the centre has merged its two licenses into one. There are 58 children enrolled, including 20 children under two. It is organised into two rooms to cater for the different age groups.</p><p>The service is part of the Kidicorp organisation that provides administrative and professional support. A centre manager supervises and takes responsibility for day-to-day centre operations. Team leaders have responsibility for care routines and programme implementation for the different age groups. The centre manager has given a high priority to building a professional teaching team in response to some staff turnover since the 2011 ERO review. Over 80 percent of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes respectful and trusting relationships, with a focus on the individual child and their family. It encourages a learning programme and environment that captures each child‚Äôs strengths, interests and culture through exploration, challenges and fun. The philosophy places an emphasis on ensuring that the programme acknowledges and incorporates bicultural practices.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to suggestions for ongoing improvement made in the 2011 ERO reports. These related to strengthening approaches to programme planning, partnerships with parents to support children‚Äôs learning, and self review processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive high quality care. They enjoy warm, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Teachers are accomplished at supporting and guiding children‚Äôs growing social understandings. Transitions and routines are unhurried and respond to the natural rhythms of the day. The tone in the centre is calm and children are settled. Children and staff display a strong sense of belonging and enjoyment in being at the centre.</p><p>Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play, and the programme has an easy flow.</p><p>All children benefit from the good opportunities for learning about literacy and numeracy through play that are on offer throughout the day. The ready for school programme has identified appropriate skills and ways of learning that will help children make the transition to school. These skills are developed within meaningful and responsive play contexts. Teachers use inclusive practices that enable children with special learning needs to participate in the programme.</p><p>Developing a deeper understanding about provision for infants and toddlers has been a focus for the centre. Professional learning and development and changes to curriculum and the environment have resulted in positive outcomes for children. Teachers skilfully provide opportunities to develop children‚Äôs language. They respond to infants‚Äô early attempts at verbalising and use language to soothe and comfort. They also model new words for toddlers and give them time to respond and converse. A variety of resources are easily accessible allowing children to make independent choices about their play.</p><p>Teachers in the preschool room are developing discrete play areas that support children‚Äôs learning in the different curriculum areas. Consideration should now be given to how these play areas can provoke greater interest and more exploratory play by children in the preschool room. There is also a need to upgrade the outdoor area for older children to provide opportunities for greater physical challenge.</p><p>Respect for biculturalism is evident in the environment and centre practices. Some teachers confidently take responsibility for integrating waiata, karakia, action songs and te reo MƒÅori into the programme. These good role models are building the confidence and te reo MƒÅori practice of all staff.</p><p>New programme planning and assessment practices focus on children‚Äôs individual interests and allow teachers to respond to an evolving curriculum. Teachers focus on ways of learning and how children‚Äôs learning can be extended. They make good use of programme evaluation to reflect on the impact their teaching practices are having on children‚Äôs learning. Planning and assessment practices could now be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>considering ways to capture each child‚Äôs language, culture and identity</li>
<li>a continued focus on planning for extending the learning.</li>
</ul><p>Links to the community are an important part of the centre programme. These links include growing relationships with the local primary schools to support smooth transitions for children. Community members are welcomed into the centre and children enjoy frequent excursions outside the centre.</p><p>Effective leadership is a prominent feature of the centre and contributes to positive outcomes for children. The centre manager has successfully built a strong professional team culture that recognises and grows leadership among staff.</p><p>The leadership team have high expectations for staff as professionals. These expectations include a commitment by staff to their own ongoing professional learning. They also take shared responsibility for the outcomes of the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plans. The leadership team benefits from appropriate administrative and professional support from the Kidicorp umbrella organisation.</p><p>Centre leaders have a good understanding of self review. There is evidence that self review is leading to ongoing improvements in the centre. Leaders ensure that staff and parent perspectives are reflected in reviews and a shared ownership of outcomes is evident.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to refine processes for programme planning and assessment</li>
<li>further develop the outdoor environment to provide challenge for older children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Albany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Albany will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>1 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
