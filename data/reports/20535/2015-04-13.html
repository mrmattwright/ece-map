</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (10 P) Constellation offers morning and afternoon sessions for children from three years to school age. The community attending the centre is predominately NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ and Chinese, with a small number of children who are MƒÅori or of other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre continues to be very effectively led and managed. It is licensed for 30 children and operates within the purpose-built Kindercare Constellation complex in Mairangi Bay. Since the centre‚Äôs previous ERO review in February 2012, the complex has merged from four licences to two and now offers sessional programme options. The sessional service is in its third year of operation and children can attend up to five sessions per week. There has also been a significant focus on strengthening learning partnerships with families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre philosophy and vision guides and underpins all practices and developments at the centre. The philosophy reflects early childhood as a precious stage in life, a time when significant adults build connections and prioritise keeping children ‚Äòsafe, loved and learning‚Äô. Teachers work together with parents to celebrate and help develop each child‚Äôs potential.</p><p>The Kindercare umbrella organisation provides the centre with management and administration systems, including a policy and procedural framework. The area manager, centre director and centre supervisor/curriculum support person provide high quality governance and effective professional leadership. All staff play a significant role in sustaining and further developing positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers use effective strategies to help children to settle quickly into the centre and play. An unhurried atmosphere gives children the chance to explore at their own pace and direct their own learning. Children are given the freedom to sustain play for extended periods of time and to follow their own interests. They can choose to play independently or in groups with other children. Friendship groups are evident and children are at ease with each other and adults.</p><p>The outdoor area is particularly inviting for children. It offers them a range of equipment and play options. These are designed to capture their interests and meet their learning needs. There are good opportunities for children to explore science and nature themes. Play options are offered to develop children‚Äôs physical coordination, strength and agility. Children can construct and create art, explore and enjoy quiet natural spaces. ERO observed many individual children and groups of children happily engaged in sustained imaginative and creative play.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to begin their journey as life-long learners. They have good opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills and to learn about and use information communication technologies (ICT). Older children are encouraged to attend morning sessions. Aspects of this programme are well designed to help them in their transition to school.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô programme planning reflects the contribution of children, parents and whƒÅnau. Stories about children‚Äôs learning are well documented on the recently introduced <em>Educa</em> web-based programme. This gives parents current and meaningful information about their children‚Äôs experiences and learning progress at the centre. It enables parents to follow up and extend children‚Äôs learning at home and to share children‚Äôs emerging interests. Teachers are now aiming to record more individual learning stories that show each child‚Äôs development over time.</p><p>Teachers engage with whƒÅnau, know parents and children well and build genuine partnerships with families. Centre leaders are actively working to build a sense of community among the diversity of parents and cultural groups using the service. Parents express a high level of satisfaction with the service and the commitment shown by staff. They value the unhurried routines and the time teachers take to provide quality feedback about their child‚Äôs day and learning. Parents appreciate how well teachers respond to children‚Äôs individual needs and their willingness to work closely with families and external agencies for children requiring specialist support.</p><p>The long-serving and experienced teaching team work collaboratively. They bring complementary strengths to the team and support each other‚Äôs professional learning and development. Teachers discuss what they notice and recognise about children‚Äôs learning and work well together to respond to and extend this learning.</p><p>Teachers' approach to children is underpinned by the service‚Äôs core values of respect and care. They consistently ask children about their preferences and needs and offer them choices. This ensures that children feel listened to, respected and valued. ERO noted the positive way in which teachers guided children and sensitively supported them to refocus where necessary. Most teachers skilfully extend children‚Äôs thinking through careful and responsive questioning. Centre leaders and teachers are aware that continuing to deepen conversations with children will enhance children‚Äôs experiences and learning.</p><p>The centre has made considerable developments to the bicultural dimensions of its programme. This is a result of tapping into the considerable knowledge and skills of its parent/whƒÅnau community. Strengths in this area include the:</p><ul>
<li>fostering of bicultural learning at an organisational, teacher and parent level</li>
<li>use of the Awataha Marae to enrich staff learning experiences and opportunities for bicultural leadership.</li>
</ul><p>The centre now has a good platform for further growth. Building on these strengths, leaders and teachers plan to review the curriculum and teacher practices with the aim of further increasing the centre‚Äôs bicultural capability.</p><p>The centre benefits from highly capable leadership and collaborative team work. Centre leaders and teachers participate in effective ongoing professional development to learn about current best practice in early childhood education. They make appropriate use of up-to-date information and research, along with reflection and evaluation of their practices, to continue to deliver high quality care and education for children.</p><p>The area manager, centre director and centre supervisor/curriculum support person capably guide the centre‚Äôs strategic direction. They promote high expectations, and support teachers to meet these expectations. The policy framework and management planning are sound. Centre self review is rigorous, systematic, and well documented. It focuses on improvement and invites parent contributions and feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified that the next stages of centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build on teachers‚Äô knowledge of the range of cultures in the centre and incorporate this into learning programmes</li>
<li>considering how to best promote children‚Äôs longer-term investigations and inquiries within the context of sessional programmes.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees that these developments would promote enhanced outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (10 P) Constellation completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (10 P) Constellation will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
