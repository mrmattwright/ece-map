</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kid&rsquo;s Land Educare Centre is a privately owned centre in Blockhouse Bay. The centre is licensed for 67 children, including eight children up to two years old. Children may attend for half day or full day sessions. The centre consists of two adapted homes on one property, with two separate outdoor playgrounds.</p><p>The founder/centre manager&rsquo;s vision promotes Christian values, and bilingual learning in a Chinese Mandarin programme. The manager works closely with two supervisors and five teachers, who are all qualified and committed to the centre&rsquo;s vision and values.</p><p>The community is predominantly Chinese and Malaysian. Shared values and beliefs make this the centre of choice for many families who seek to maintain the children&rsquo;s first language or to preserve Asian culture and identity.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report noted teachers&rsquo; competent use of English and Mandarin to enrich children&rsquo;s learning. This continues to be the case.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The nurturing care children receive promotes their sense of belonging. They happily choose from a variety of activities and resources, and make friends easily as they enjoy playing with children of all ages. Children relate well to adults, and confidently initiate conversations. Developing children&rsquo;s independence is a key focus, as teachers work with parents to encourage children to build self-managing skills.</p><p>Teachers are knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and genuinely interested in children and their parents. They reflect the cultures of the children and the community. Teachers use home languages to interact with parents and invite them into the centre&rsquo;s programme and environment.</p><p>Parents speak very positively about the centre and appreciate the ways their children are nurtured and prepared for school. They contribute to the programme formally and freely express their aspirations about their children&rsquo;s learning. Many parents have participated in the programme by sharing their expertise and supporting children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><p>The centre benefits from the spaciousness of the two houses for different age groups. Carefully considered resources and adaptable spaces promote children&rsquo;s curiosity and creativity. Children are offered a variety of activities that support their interests in sensory, artistic and dramatic play.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s curriculum strongly reflects the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Aspects of Reggio Emilia and Montessori approaches are also evident in the programme. The programme responds to children&rsquo;s interests through planned research projects. Assessment practices are well embedded through sound monitoring processes. Teachers formally evaluate the programme and their practice through written reflections and team discussions.</p><p>Teachers benefit from regular internal research and attend external professional learning workshops. They are given leadership responsibilities and work collaboratively in programme planning and evaluation. Performance appraisals help teachers to strengthen their practice and to achieve the centre&rsquo;s strategic goals.</p><p>The manager leads the centre&rsquo;s vision of children learning through their culture and first language. She works closely with supervisors to manage the centre&rsquo;s daily operations. A shared vision and respectful relationships are features of the leadership team. Their commitment to ongoing improvement is strongly evident. A well understood self-review process is implemented. Review questions guide teachers to reflect on their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and supervisors agree that development priorities could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>maximising children&rsquo;s access to and play areas and resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a more evaluative focus in self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining teacher appraisal processes to promote understanding about New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kid's Land Educare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kid's Land Educare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dianne Moffitt</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>16 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
