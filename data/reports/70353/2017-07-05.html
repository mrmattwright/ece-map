</table><p>Educational Child Care Centre Inc is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Educational Childcare Centre Inc is a not-for-profit, community-based centre. The centre provides education and care for children to school age in three separate rooms. Each room has access to an outdoor area.</p><p>Most of the staff are registered early childhood teachers. Many of the staff have worked in the centre for some time.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on promoting bicultural relationships that support children's wellbeing, sense of belonging and learning through inquiry and exploration.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the principal, senior leaders and some new staff were appointed. In 2014, as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, the centre temporarily re-located. In 2016, the centre returned to the old site into a new building.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a well-presented bicultural environment. Te reo and tikanga Māori are well embedded into the centre's curriculum, philosophy, documentation and values. Children have many opportunities to use and hear te reo and learn about tikanga Māori openly in the daily life of the centre. Māori children are encouraged and supported to be proud and successful, as Māori. Teachers have a good understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori. Parents and whānau actively work in partnership with leaders and teachers. Their knowledge and aspirations are used to integrate Māori values, language and culture into all aspects of the centre and in children's learning.</p><p>Pacific children's cultures are recognised and respected. Teachers and leaders are responsive and understand that Pacific children come from diverse cultures and languages. Pacific children have opportunities to experience success, as Pacific. Pacific parents are valued as cultural experts and their knowledge is used in appropriate and meaningful ways that are important to children.</p><p>Children are actively engaged in their learning. A wide range of choices, resources and experiences are provided to extend their learning. Children experience friendly, caring and supportive relationships with each other and their teachers. The holistic development and wellbeing of each child is a focus for leaders and teachers. Diverse needs and cultures are well supported. Parents are given many opportunities to be involved in their child's learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive a high level of care and nurturing. Teachers are responsive and have an in-depth knowledge of each child. They carefully connect children's care with their home routines to provide consistency and continuity and effectively support the child's wellbeing and learning. The environment is calm and routines are flexible and centred on the needs of each child and family. Children are happy and relaxed in the nursery environment.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are well established, yet flexible to meet the needs of the child and the family. Parents and whānau are kept well informed about their child's progress, interests and strengths.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have high expectations for teaching and learning. They have warm, respectful reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whānau. They work collaboratively to ensure that children have positive learning experiences. Teachers are actively involved in children's learning. They make good use of conversations with children to extend thinking and promote problem-solving.</p><p>The centre's management committee has developed a strategic plan that clearly identifies the service's priorities. The committee of parents and whānau are from a wide range of cultures and backgrounds. They value the teachers' skills. Appropriate links are made between strategic goals and professional development opportunities. Leaders and teachers consult and involve parents and whānau in the decision making of the centre.</p><p>The centre has useful internal evaluation processes. Leaders and teachers gather a wide range of information and carefully analyse the data to make improvements that benefit children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the service provider and leaders agree that the next steps for Educational Child Care Centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the outcomes of the strategic goals in achieving the centre's vision.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Educational Child Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Educational Child Care Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>5 July 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
