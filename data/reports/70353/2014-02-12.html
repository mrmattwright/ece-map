</table><p>Educational Child Care Centre is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Educational Childcare Centre Inc is a not-for-profit, community-based centre run by a management committee. The centre provides full-time care and education for children from 0-6 years. Children attend from a wide geographical area.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on promoting relationships that support children‚Äôs wellbeing, sense of belonging and learning through inquiry and exploration.</p><p>Some staffing changes have occurred since the January 2010 ERO review. A new centre manager, senior leaders and some new staff have been appointed.</p><p>As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, the centre will temporarily re-locate in 2014 so that it can be completely rebuilt on its current site.</p><p>The centre is currently preparing to relicense under the 2008 early childhood regulations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is evident in practice, especially in the way teachers focus on children‚Äôs holistic development and provide very good support for children. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>positive, warm and affirming relationships that support children‚Äôs wellbeing, sense of belonging and learning</li>
<li>working at the pace and physical level of children</li>
<li>ensuring that interactions with children are unhurried</li>
<li>encouraging children to explore and follow their own learning interests.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from the strong focus on building learning attitudes and skills that are linked to<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Children‚Äôs interests and learning needs form the basis for programmes that operate at the centre.</p><p>Teachers assess learning well. ERO observed some very good examples of assessment of children‚Äôs learning with their next learning steps identified.</p><p>The under two‚Äôs area now has new leadership. The range of improvements in this area that have been occurring includes:</p><ul>
<li>the development of an under two‚Äôs philosophy in consultation with parents</li>
<li>an increased emphasis on attachments and continuity of care</li>
<li>ensuring that transitions are carefully planned and timed to meet the needs of children and reflect the feedback from parents.</li>
</ul><p>Senior leaders regularly monitor the quality of assessment and provide appropriate feedback to teachers. Their main focus has been on building a strong team to ensure consistency of practices across the centre. Regular review is part of the centre‚Äôs culture. Senior leaders have a sustained focus on continuous improvement and have recently introduced a framework to guide centre review of programmes and practices. Further refinement of self review questions will strengthen evaluative practices and outcomes.</p><p>Biculturalism is clearly reflected in the centre, especially in the attractive MƒÅori carvings in the outdoor environment. Staff have recently reviewed bicultural practices and are continuing to provide opportunities to consult with whƒÅnau. The centre‚Äôs professional learning programme for teachers has been focused on ways of making te reo and tikanga MƒÅori increasingly evident in programmes and practices.</p><p>The parent community is well represented on the centre‚Äôs management committee and represents a wide range of cultures and backgrounds. Teachers and parents have positive and supportive relationships that are strongly focused on meeting the needs of all children at the centre. Parents and whƒÅnau continue to make valuable contributions to the practical running of the centre. This is providing significant support for the work of teachers and senior leaders and has positive benefits for the children.</p><p>Members of the centre‚Äôs management committee are closely involved in providing practical support for the centre and its staff. They keep good records of monthly meetings and are currently reviewing policies and practices in preparation for re-licensing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management committee and centre manager have been investigating a range of useful practices related to centre relocation and rebuilding. It is now timely for them to develop a more formal and planned approach to help guide and manage centre developments during this time.</p><p>The centre manager has identified the need to improve overall centre planning to clarify priorities for improvement and future directions. Senior leaders have also identified the need to further improve programme planning to make it more manageable for teachers, and to further improve children‚Äôs learning by extending high quality assessment practices across all teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Educational Child Care Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h4>Recommendation</h4><p>The centre manager and senior leaders must ensure that, as part of current relicensing, risk assessment management processes for trips and excursion out of the centre reflect the requirements of the 2008 regulations for early childhood centres.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service gain?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Educational Child Care Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>12 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
