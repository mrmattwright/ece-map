<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left"><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p align="left">Little Earth Montessori is one of two privately owned early learning centres and provides education and care for children aged two to six years. Parents have choices of morning, afternoon or all-day sessions.</p><p align="left">The two centres are led by a principal who oversees the quality of service and assists leaders to sustain and improve overall performance. Teachers ably support the shared vision of a unique educational environment with a focus on academic excellence.</p><p align="left">This is the preschool&rsquo;s first ERO review since it opened in 2009. It has purpose-built premises that use sustainable design principles to reflect the commitment to operating in harmony with the natural world. Little Earth is part of Enviroschools, a programme run by the Enviroschools Foundation. In 2011, Little Earth achieved the Green Gold enviro-schools award. The environment is aesthetically pleasing and creates a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere. This enviro-nature approach is strongly led by the principal both nationally and internationally.</p><p align="left">The programme provides a holistic approach to children&rsquo;s learning and is based on the Montessori philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. The quality of education is high.</p><p align="left">Children are encouraged to respect, and take responsibility for, themselves, others and the environment. Through their involvement in a wide variety of learning experiences they develop literacy and mathematical skills. Children acquire good work habits. They become absorbed in their learning. They gain confidence and a sense of accomplishment and well being from persisting with, and completing, their work.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are affirming and caring, and are based on their deep knowledge of and interest in each child. They model and expect courtesy, and set clear guidelines for considerate behaviour by children.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s learning and progress are well recorded in attractive and carefully prepared individual profiles. Positive relationships are evident with parents and children.</p><p align="left">Next steps for development identified by ERO include strengthening evidence-based self review and completing regular evaluation of the planned programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Little Earth Montessori Kapiti was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Little Earth Montessori Kapiti.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Little Earth Montessori opened in July 2009. The centre is licensed under the 2008 regulations.</p><p align="left">The preschool is an enviro preschool that aims to operate in harmony with the natural environment. The enviro-nature focus provides opportunities for children to engage with the living world in authentic and meaningful ways. This curriculum is advocated as a living curriculum and is integrated into the Montessori and Te Wh&#257;riki curricula.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><strong>Strategic direction</strong></p><p align="left">The clear vision, mission and identified values outline Little Earth&rsquo;s aspirations for the provision of providing a unique educational environment with a focus on academic excellence. The philosophy clearly underpins the strategic plan and the Montessori approach to teaching and learning.</p><p align="left">The principal has established robust systems and processes including appraisal, to guide overall centre operations. A collaborative team approach is promoted. Leadership opportunities are fostered through teachers having specific curriculum responsibilities.</p><p align="left"><strong>Programme</strong></p><p align="left">The programme reflects the stated philosophy. It is child centred and is respectful of children as unique individuals. Learning experiences are guided by a vision for the holistic development of the child.</p><p align="left">An enviro-nature programme is embedded throughout the curriculum and practices for sustainability are promoted. Children take an active role in taking responsibility for many aspects of food preparation, recycling and caring for the living world. Excursions into the local community provide opportunities for children to further their knowledge of nature and incorporate elements of tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori are effectively integrated throughout interactions and the programme. A sense of ako is evident &ndash; all have dual roles as teachers and learners.</p><p align="left">Routines and rituals are well managed and are social occasions. They provide a framework for the day and children join in confidently. Children participate in regular activities that promote their self-managing and independence skills.</p><p align="left"><strong>Assessment, Planning and Evaluation</strong></p><p align="left">Detailed information is collated about each child. These records guide teachers in providing targeted assistance to support children&rsquo;s learning and development. Parents are well informed about their child&rsquo;s progress through regular parent-teacher meetings and well presented portfolios. Recent initiatives have enhanced the engagement of parents through this process.</p><p align="left"><strong>Interactions</strong></p><p align="left">Teachers are warm, responsive and respectful and model the values of grace and courtesy. They are attuned to children&rsquo;s feelings, interests and curiosity. Teachers draw on a wide range of effective strategies to engage children in sustained conversations and deepen their learning. Some teachers support children to use their thinking and reasoning skills.</p><p align="left">Children work and play cooperatively and collaboratively in self-selected activities for extended periods of time. They are viewed as confident and competent learners.</p><p align="left">Children and families are well supported in transitions. A well managed induction programme into the centre assists children to settle and develop a sense of belonging.</p><p align="left"><strong>Environment</strong></p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s well-being and sense of belonging are effectively fostered through the high quality learning environment. The spaces are organised with great care and have a sense of purpose and place.</p><p align="left">This aesthetic learning environment provides rich opportunities for children to explore and interact with the living world. The ecological perspective is woven through the learning experiences offered and children engage in gardening, paper making and ongoing learning about conservation.</p><p align="left">There is an easy flow between indoor and outdoor areas which enables an extension of the curriculum. The preschool is well resourced with specialised Montessori materials and activities that vary in complexity and challenge.</p><p align="left">Collaborative and quiet spaces are available for children to use throughout the day. Children are purposefully engaged in activities in a calm and settled atmosphere.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Self Review Evidence based self review requires further development. To improve teachers&rsquo; ability to review, consideration should be given to clarifying the difference between development and review. Teachers should gather a wider range of information and use this to undertake in-depth analysis to more effectively answer the evaluative question framing the review.</p><p align="left">Programmes should be regularly evaluated and outcomes used to inform teaching strategies and subsequent learning experiences.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Little Earth Montessori Kapiti completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4.

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-little-earth-montessori-kapiti" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Little Earth Montessori Kapiti</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Little Earth Montessori Kapiti.</p><p align="left">Little Earth Montessori is one of two privately owned early learning centres and provides education and care for children aged two to six years. Parents have choices of morning, afternoon or all-day sessions.</p><p align="left">The two centres are led by a principal who oversees the quality of service and assists leaders to sustain and improve overall performance. Teachers ably support the shared vision of a unique educational environment with a focus on academic excellence.</p><p align="left">This is the preschool&rsquo;s first ERO review since it opened in 2009. It has purpose-built premises that use sustainable design principles to reflect the commitment to operating in harmony with the natural world. Little Earth is part of Enviroschools, a programme run by the Enviroschools Foundation. In 2011, Little Earth achieved the Green Gold enviro-schools award. The environment is aesthetically pleasing and creates a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere. This enviro-nature approach is strongly led by the principal both nationally and internationally.</p><p align="left">The programme provides a holistic approach to children&rsquo;s learning and is based on the Montessori philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. The quality of education is high.</p><p align="left">Children are encouraged to respect, and take responsibility for, themselves, others and the environment. Through their involvement in a wide variety of learning experiences they develop literacy and mathematical skills. Children acquire good work habits. They become absorbed in their learning. They gain confidence and a sense of accomplishment and well being from persisting with, and completing, their work.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are affirming and caring, and are based on their deep knowledge of and interest in each child. They model and expect courtesy, and set clear guidelines for considerate behaviour by children.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s learning and progress are well recorded in attractive and carefully prepared individual profiles. Positive relationships are evident with parents and children.</p><p align="left">Next steps for development identified by ERO include strengthening evidence-based self review and completing regular evaluation of the planned programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region (Acting)</p></html>
