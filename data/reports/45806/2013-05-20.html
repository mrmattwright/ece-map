<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Weymouth Early Discoveries Centre opened in October 2011. The centre is on the grounds of Weymouth Primary School and was fully licensed under the 2008 ECC Regulations in October 2012. It is part of the Counties Manukau Participation Project run by the Ministry of Education. This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><p>The centre is staffed by seven qualified teachers, teachers in training, administration support staff and volunteers from the community. The head teacher was appointed in 2012 and, along with the centre principal, manages this centre and its well established sister centre, Early Discoveries in Manurewa. Staff come with a diverse range of cultural strengths and teaching experience that is based on current research and approaches.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide a high quality, inclusive programme that is strongly reflective of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and also incorporates Christian values. They have a genuine commitment to the principles of partnership in Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to implementing a bicultural curriculum. Attractively presented assessment and planning documentation shows how children&rsquo;s group and individual interests guide the programme. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are highly valued, show children&rsquo;s learning journey and reflect their strengths and cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers have respectful and trusting relationships with children and their families, and strong connections with the local community. They actively foster parent and wh&#257;nau involvement in children&rsquo;s learning and development by keeping them fully informed. Teachers encourage parents to share children&rsquo;s strengths and ideas. Parents clearly appreciate the teachers and the service they provide.</p><p>Teachers have developed good processes to identify and respond to the aspirations of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. All cultural backgrounds are valued and cultural knowledge affirmed. The centre has strong connections with the adjacent primary school which supports children and their families as they make the transition to school. There is a strong sense of unity, partnership and collaboration in the centre.</p><p>The well resourced learning environment reflects the multicultural backgrounds of children attending and supports their sustained engagement in play. Children are able to be creative and expressive through an extensive variety of art, dance, and music activities. Teachers&rsquo; skilful interactions assist children to use literacy, numeracy, science and technology concepts in meaningful ways. Children have very good opportunities to explore and be physically active in the spacious outdoor area. They play cooperatively, share ideas and are developing a sense of care and responsibility for themselves and others. They have fun and are confident, eager learners.</p><p>The centre management committee includes parents, church and community representatives, and some centre personnel. They provide very good managerial and administrative support for the centre. There is efficient record keeping, clear reporting and a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures. Self review is child focused and purposeful. The centre philosophy is regularly reviewed and is evident in teachers&rsquo; practice. Clear strategic goals that align to the centre&rsquo;s vision statement are clearly outlined in annual plans.</p><p>Culturally responsive and socially appropriate professional leadership guides the centre&rsquo;s goal of providing high quality early childhood education and care. Positive working relationships and collaboration between management and staff contribute to the culture of trust and respect. Performance management which promotes good practice and leadership opportunities is in place. The positive impact of professional development can be seen in the emphasis given to promoting leadership opportunities for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers have identified some areas for ongoing review and development. ERO agrees that they could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the depth of perspectives included in strategic planning</li>
<li>encourage more parent and wh&#257;nau contribution in planning for children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>strengthen use of evaluation as a tool to support teacher reflection on their own teaching practice.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Weymouth Early Discoveries Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
