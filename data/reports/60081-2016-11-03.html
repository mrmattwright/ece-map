</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Discovery Early Learning Centre is situated in Kelson, Lower Hutt. It caters for 36 children over two years of age. The centre is governed by the Discovery Christian Centre Trust and operates in a purpose-built complex, alongside other community services the trust provides.</p><p>The roll comprises Māori, Samoan, South African, Asian, Pākehā, and European learners. There have been some changes to staffing and the centre manager role since the November 2013 ERO report. Recent property developments include upgrading the outdoor environment and the provision of a designated sleep room.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of integrating biblical values into curriculum. Each child is seen as unique with God given strengths. Central to this is allowing children to flourish, develop at their own pace and capabilities in a secure, caring and stimulating environment.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in professional learning and development opportunities that are well supported by trustees.</p><p>Some of the areas identified for development in the previous ERO report require further improvement and feature as key next steps in this report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s interests and learning are well supported. They confidently make choices and have opportunities to lead their learning. Relationships are warm, encouraging and empowering, assisting their sense of belonging. Children are actively involved in their play with others.</p><p>Teachers foster children's independence and self-help skills. They purposefully set up the environment to encourage children's exploration. Teachers recognise and acknowledge children's, efforts, progress and successes. Staff are collaborative and support each other. </p><p>Children have some opportunities to learn about te ao Māori. Professional development has assisted teachers to build their knowledge. They express a commitment to further growing their understanding and promoting bicultural practices. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Teachers value and seek the contributions of families. They share information with them in a variety of ways. This includes the use of an online tool that clearly shows children's assessment, centre happenings and their involvement in group activities.</p><p>A recent review of centre assessment practices identified areas of strength and those aspects requiring strengthening. Planned actions to improve these practices should assist in raising the consistency and quality of these records.</p><p>Teachers have some useful processes in place for centre programme planning. Deepening evaluation to ascertain effectiveness, should help teachers to more clearly identify the impact of their teaching on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>There are established links with local schools that effectively support children and families as they transition.</p><p>There are now processes in place to document review of centre practices and policies. Leaders acknowledge that they need to make wider use of review and inquiry. The process continues to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>A priority is to review the centre leadership structure to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support clarity of roles and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop and use self review to improve to teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide more opportunities to grow teacher practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There has been good progress in developing performance management processes, including the teacher appraisal system. Ensuring that leaders receive ongoing feedback and feedforward to support their growth is a next step.</p><p>Recent reporting to trustees has been established to inform them of aspects of centre operation. Extending this information should assist the board to more clearly know about the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, trustees and the leader agree that the following areas should be further strengthened:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>self-review and internal evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarity about leadership and management roles and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practices and Māori success as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aspects of the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Discovery Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Discovery Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Central</p><p>3 November 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
