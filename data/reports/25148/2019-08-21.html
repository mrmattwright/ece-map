</table><p>Akoteu Kato Kakala¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Kato Kakala is a community based early childhood centre. The curriculum is underpinned by Tongan language and culture. Nearly all the children attending have Tongan heritage.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Kakala Malie Incorporated Society through a management committee. The committee is responsible for the financial and operational management of the centre. A centre manager and head teacher lead a teaching team who are mainly registered teachers.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2012 and 2015 reports acknowledged the centre‚Äôs effective practices in supporting children‚Äôs language and cultural identity. In 2015, ERO identified that managers and teachers could strengthen their shared understandings about effective teaching strategies to extend and challenge children‚Äôs learning. Teachers have continued to improve this aspect of their practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The strong focus on Tongan language and culture has been sustained. Teachers and children converse confidently in Tongan at group times and during play experiences. Christian and traditional Tongan songs are well integrated into spontaneous play and daily routines. Teachers also integrate te reo and waiata MƒÅori within the programme well.</p><p>The curriculum promotes the values of ako, ilo and poto very effectively. Children at the centre are enthusiastic learners who negotiate, play cooperatively and spend time in focused activities of their choice. Infants and toddlers mix well with older children and are encouraged to develop independence. Teachers‚Äô relationships with children and their families are warm and caring.</p><p>Teachers provide resources to support children's exploration and ask relevant questions to foster their thinking. Their conversations acknowledge children‚Äôs interests. Teachers listen carefully to children. Literacy and numeracy experiences are regularly included in children‚Äôs play. They have very good opportunities to investigate science through a deliberate teacher focus on the natural environment.</p><p>The very well resourced indoor and outdoor environments are a feature of the centre. They reflect teachers‚Äô passion and commitment to improving children‚Äôs learning and celebrating Tongan culture. The indoor area is thoughtfully and attractively presented with clearly defined areas and accessible resources. Wall displays, and photographs allow children and parents to revisit learning experiences at the centre. The outdoor environment provides good opportunities for children to engage in physical and exploratory play.</p><p>The curriculum is highly responsive to children‚Äôs interests. Teachers plan for, assess and evaluate children‚Äôs learning very well. They have worked to develop shared understandings of ways to document and analyse children‚Äôs learning. Attractive individual learning records show that children have opportunities to investigate, ask questions and play co-operatively with others. Teachers recognise children‚Äôs learning and celebrate their progress over time. Parents' appreciation of what their children are learning at the centre is becoming more evident in children's assessment records.</p><p>Centre leaders have high expectations for teachers' professional practice. The teacher appraisal system is effective in promoting reflection and improved teacher practice. Teachers have continued to participate in professional learning and further study that supports the growth of skilled teaching practices. Centre leaders contribute to growing the capacity of staff at other centres through their facilitation of, and participation in professional development opportunities.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have established highly effective internal evaluation systems. They have taken time to develop shared understandings of evaluation based on a Tongan approach to continuous improvement. A clear policy framework guides centre operations. Comprehensive strategic and annual plans continue to inform the direction of the centre. The committee, leaders and teachers monitor progress against these goals to ensure ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documenting the role of the teacher in extending children's learning within assessment and curriculum planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining internal evaluation processes to clearly show the impact of the curriculum and teaching practices on improved outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Kato Kakala completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
