</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Kids Kindergarten is an all-day service located in the grounds of the recently closed Waitoa School. It is open from 8.45am to 3.15pm from Monday to Friday to meet the needs of farming families in the surrounding rural areas. The centre is licensed to cater for up to 40 children over two years of age. Currently, 63 children are enrolled. Five children are Māori and 1 is Samoan.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Te Aroha Kindergarten Association. The head teacher is supported by the association manager and a senior teacher employed by the association to provide guidance about early childhood education practice. The centre is staffed by five qualified, registered teachers. The association is working on a project to extend the early childhood education service available on the former Waitoa school site.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. The 2013 ERO review identified agreed next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>engaging parents' contribution to their children's assessment and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrating te reo Māori in incidental conversations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an appraisal process focused on positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has increased its communication with parents and is able to make collaborative decisions that improve children's learning opportunities. Teachers use the outcomes of their appraisal to develop a shared goal and identify professional development to support the provision of high quality early childhood education. The association has still to make changes to the policy and specific procedures to meet the requirements of the Education Council New Zealand.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy reflects the whakataukī, <em>Whanga ka tupu, ka puawai: that which is nurtured, blossoms and grows.</em> It is focused on relationships with people, places and things, and in treasuring the natural world. Children are given opportunities to develop a range of skills and understandings that contribute to their self esteem, and develop their ability to make positive choices and engage in tuakana-teina relationships. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident learners who are highly engaged in active play and exploration. The indoor and outdoor environments are thoughtfully organised to allow them to choose from an extensive variety of stimulating activities. Care routines are carefully implemented to allow children to engage in extended periods of uninterrupted play, individually or in small groups. Children are developing as resilient, self-managing learners who are encouraged to take risks and problem solve in a safe, supportive setting.</p><p>Relationships among children and adults are nurturing, and respectful. Teachers recognise and affirm children's considerate and constructive behaviour. They use consistent and unobtrusive positive guidance to build children's social competence and ability to solve conflicts. Children display a positive sense of self and have a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum is inquiry-based and child-centred. Children play cooperatively, developing imaginative scenarios that grow from creative and artistic use of equipment, resources and art materials. Their involvement in outdoor play includes opportunities for physical challenge and possibilities to discover ideas about the natural world. The well-designed, responsive curriculum supports all children's development and learning, and provides them with experience of success.</p><p>The experienced teaching team make skilled use of intentional teaching strategies to support and extend children's learning. They recognise the importance of children growing their oral language and communication skills and integrate oral language, literacy and numeracy naturally in the programme. They read stories and ask open questions to deepen children's thinking and provide equipment to introduce mathematical concepts and numeracy skills. Teachers use te reo Māori, waiata and Māori legends to acknowledge the bicultural nature of New Zealand culture. Interactions with teachers are enabling children to develop in practical contexts, meaningful knowledge and abilities that provide a sound basis for ongoing learning.</p><p>The kindergarten supports children and their families as they start school. Teachers build relationships and gather information from schools located in a range of districts surrounding Waitoa. Parents are supported to familiarise themselves with schools where their children can be enrolled. Children develop a sense of social connection with friends who have graduated to schools they expect to attend.</p><p>The head teacher has built a collaborative team that is committed to implementing the kindergarten philosophy. She provides strong professional leadership with an emphasis on reflective practice. Teachers are encouraged to research current best practice in early childhood education and engage in purposeful self review to evaluate and improve the quality of the kindergarten curriculum. The head teacher seeks to develop productive partnerships with other education providers, specialist agencies, parents and the wider community. Her forward looking and inclusive approach helps the kindergarten to sustain its welcoming and confident climate.</p><p>The kindergarten has well-developed assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Teachers regularly focus on small groups of children, sharing information from individual portfolios and preparing a summary of each child's interests and development that includes the child's own voice. Teachers and parents use this information to agree on a shared goal for the child's ongoing development. Teachers recognise children who may benefit from additional support, and in consultation with parents, make reference to specialist external agencies. Parents appreciate the use of digital technology to share information about their child's participation and learning. This rich information recognises children's engagement, progress and development and the effectiveness of the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have benefitted from their involvement in relevant professional development and learning. Their key focuses have been on Māori practices and the implementation of Reggio Emilia philosophy. Through formal and informal study of te reo and tikanga Māori practices, teachers have developed their awareness of the history of the local area. Teachers respond effectively to the needs and expectations of the families and children they serve. The kindergarten has established a culture where children and parents actively participate in the life of the centre, displaying a strong sense of trust and belonging.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should consider reviewing outdoor learning areas to evaluate the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>literacy and numeracy are promoted in outdoor contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children can freely access outdoor equipment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would be timely to undertake this review considering the intention to move the kindergarten to adjacent areas of the property.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kids Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kids Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>1 December 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
