</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Starship Childrens Health - Play &amp; Recreation - WD 25A/B is one of eight licensed early childhood services located in Auckland City Hospital and governed by Allied Health Auckland. Two playrooms provide a service for long and short term patients in the two general medical wards. They are open for patients as required, particularly in the winter months. The playrooms provide a six-hour programme for 10 children up to six years of age. The 25A Playroom was not open at the time of this review and ERO was only able to observe staff practices in the 25B Playroom.</p><p>When open, the playrooms are staffed by two qualified teachers up to three personnel with hospital play specialist (HPS) qualifications. They work with children in the playrooms and hospital wards to implement <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and provide planned and responsive learning experiences. The HPS' mission is to support children, siblings and whƒÅnau with coping strategies to minimise the impact of hospitalisation and illness.</p><p>A team leader from Allied Health and a practice supervisor, who is a qualified early childhood teacher and a qualified play specialist, have responsibility for the daily management of the service. HPS are also part of a multidisciplinary team which is made up of a range of healthcare professionals.</p><p>In the past three years, HPS have been involved in ongoing professional learning and development. Internal evaluation processes have been established to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of service operations and teaching programmes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The two playrooms are well-resourced to cater for diverse ages, interests and needs of infants, toddlers, young children and teenagers. Healthcare play equipment assists children to engage in medical play.</p><p>The HPS provide responsive and sensitive support. They respect and value the languages and cultures of children and families. HPS plan to continue improving how well programmes, resources and practices reflect cultural diversity. They are strong advocates for the rights of children, their whƒÅnau and siblings and are dedicated to reducing stress during their time within the hospital environment.</p><p>The HPS are reviewing how well programmes and practices reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Their emphasis has been on improving resources and equipment. Increasing their use of te reo MƒÅori in spontaneous play situations and in written learning assessments could help HPS to improve their bicultural practice. Developing a long-term goal to reflect this service-wide focus could support planned, deliberate improvements over time.</p><p>The HPS team continues to develop shared understandings about effective practice. They regularly participate in team meetings and engage in professional discussions focused on fostering positive outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau. Individual skills contribute to team development and professional learning opportunities have added to HPS knowledge.</p><p>The team leader works collaboratively with the practice supervisor to promote improvement. Performance appraisals provide opportunities for HPS to reflect on and develop their practices. Leaders plan to strengthen appraisal by making clearer links to new Education Council requirements.</p><p>Good systems have been established for internal evaluation. HPS seek the views of families to inform improvements. The team leader and practice supervisor have identified ways to build on the significant progress that has been made in this area of practice since the 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The team leader and practice supervisor agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing annual and long-term educational goals to guide ongoing improvement</li>
<li>improving practices to promote success for MƒÅori and Pacific learners</li>
<li>continuing to improve processes for internal evaluation</li>
<li>seeking professional development support to strengthen assessment and evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Starship Childrens Health - Play &amp; Recreation - WD 25A/B completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, the employer and team leader should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>as identified in ERO's 2012 report, annual plans are developed to guide continual improvements and provision for children's education</li>
<li>non-registered staff are regularly police vetted</li>
<li>budgets and use of government funding are transparent to staff and families.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Starship Childrens Health - Play &amp; Recreation - WD 25A/B will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-hospital-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Hospital-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">
