</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Horizons Montessori Preschool is located in New Lynn, Auckland. It is licensed for up to 30 children between the ages of two and six years of age. It currently provides for 74 children. The roll is culturally diverse and includes high numbers of Chinese children.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and continues to provide a high quality programme that reflects the Montessori philosophy. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and socio-cultural theory are integrated in the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Since the 2010 ERO review the centre has strengthened its self-review processes.</p><p>The centre is well led by a committed centre leader. Teachers work collaboratively and respectfully with parents, children and staff. Self review is valued, effectively led and focused on promoting quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident to follow their interests and work together co-operatively. They are trusted to make their own choices and have established friendships with their peers and teachers. Teachers interact respectfully with children and engage them in meaningful conversations.</p><p>Teachers recognise the importance of children learning through play. They support children to become competent, independent learners. Children contribute to the learning programme and are involved in leading their own learning.</p><p>Teachers are sensitive and responsive to children‚Äôs emerging interests and individual development. They provide well considered, high quality and varied learning programmes for children to experiment and make their own discoveries. Flexible routines allow children to have the freedom and opportunities to develop their thinking skills and to solve problems. Literacy, numeracy and science learning experiences are included in meaningful ways as children play. Children also become familiar with te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Supporting children‚Äôs readiness to transition to school is an ongoing component of the programme.</p><p>Teachers use information from individual and group observations to plan and introduce specific topics for children. Their planning and assessment focuses on enhancing children‚Äôs learning experiences. Children‚Äôs assessment portfolios are now being produced online for parents. They are vibrant celebrations of children‚Äôs learning and contain good information for parents about children‚Äôs care and engagement in the programme.</p><p>Parents value opportunities to regularly provide feedback as part of centre self-review process. They express a high level of satisfaction with the education and care provided for their children, and appreciate opportunities to discuss their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre leader promotes and models professionalism, shared leadership and ongoing learning based on current and relevant educational research. She initiates discussion with local schools and early childhood centres to share new knowledge about child development and to support seamless transitions to school for children.</p><p>Teachers value relationships based on mutual respect and trust. Reflective practice is a strength of the teaching team, and teachers commit enthusiastically to the continuous review of their teaching practices. They have created a culture where children are valued, celebrated and affirmed.</p><p>The centre leader is keen to continue strengthening self review in the centre to support continual improvements for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Horizons Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Horizons Montessori Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>29 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
