</table><p>Sonrise Christian Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sonrise Christian Preschool is located in Gisborne, close to Sonrise Christian School. It is licensed for up to 39 children over two years of age. Of the 36 children enrolled, 25 are Māori and three are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy emphasises the importance of building positive relationships and children developing an understanding of Christian values.</p><p>The centre is one of two services that receives governance support from the Kingdom Kids and Education Trust. Since the August 2016 ERO report, a new centre manager has been appointed with operational oversight of the two services. A newly appointed head teacher has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the preschool.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that further improvements were needed in relation to the philosophy and priorities for children's learning, curriculum, assessment, planning and evaluation, and appraisal. The service has received support from the Ministry of Education professional development programme for early learning, SELO (strengthening early learning opportunities for children, whānau, families and communities). Significant progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a positive, caring and nurturing environment that is responsive to their strengths and interests. Teachers are attuned to the individual needs of children and respond appropriately by actively implementing strategies to support their inclusion in the programme.</p><p>Children enjoy being physically active. They make choices about their play and confidently access a good range of open-ended resources that promote curiosity, exploration, creativity and problem solving.  Literacy and mathematics and the use of te reo Māori are well integrated.</p><p>Teachers value the knowledge, strengths and skills children bring with them. They engage in play alongside the children and follow their lead. Excursions and visitors to the centre, further enhance learning and opportunities for children to make sense of their world. Parents enjoy spending time with their children at the centre and their contribution to the programme is valued. </p><p>Staff have worked collaboratively to identify what they value for children's learning: perseverance; connectedness; confidence; and respect. They have developed a shared understanding of what this means for children in practice. Assessment of children's learning reflects the enactment of these valued outcomes. Teachers should now make connections to the learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and use this as a platform to further develop the centre's local curriculum.</p><p>Planning for children's learning is responsive to their interests. Parents' aspirations are valued and form the basis of individual goals. Teachers are beginning to evaluate how well children's learning outcomes have been met. Teachers should continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation to show how intentional teaching can progress children's learning over time. </p><p>Children's culture, language and identity are valued and promoted through centre activities. Continuing to strengthen teachers' knowledge and understanding of kaupapa Māori approaches to learning remains a priority. Partnerships with parents and whānau are contributing to teachers' understanding of what success looks like for Māori children in this service.</p><p>Inclusion and participation are promoted for children requiring additional learning support. Teachers work collaboratively with parents, whānau and external agencies to identify relevant goals and to progress these.</p><p>The service has developed and implemented systems, process and practices to monitor that its expectations for high quality education and care are met. A comprehensive appraisal process has been implemented that promotes teachers' professional growth and development. Teachers' inquiries are aligned to centre priorities.</p><p>A strategic plan provides clear direction for the service to progress the areas for development identified in the previous ERO report. Identifying indicators of high quality practice should strengthen internal evaluation. These can then be used to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of developments and progress made and to inform decision making for ongoing improvement and sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, leaders and teachers agree the centre's priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices</li>
<li>intentional teaching</li>
<li>teaching strategies that promote educational success for Māori children</li>
<li>internal evaluation to measure the impact of ongoing developments.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sonrise Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sonrise Christian Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie<br> Director Review and Improvement Services Central<br>Central Region</p><p>12 February 2019 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
