</table><p>ERO has identified significant area that require further development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing robust self-review systems and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing strategic planning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum development and delivery particularly for older children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Adventures Te Puke is located in Te Puke and formerly known as The Sandbox Preschool. The centre operates in two aged-based rooms for children up to and over the age of three years. It is licensed to provide education and care for 75 children including 15 up to the age of two. At the time of this ERO review there were 89 children on the roll, a quarter of whom identify as MƒÅori and a significant number for whom English is their second or third language.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy makes a commitment to providing a nurturing, caring and supportive environment that empowers children to view themselves as successful, capable and competent learners.</p><p>In March 2015 the centre was purchased by Evolve Group Ltd (Evolve). A teacher took up the position of centre manager soon after. Minimal progress has been made to address key next steps identified in the 2015 ERO report. The centre made a good response to resolving the non-compliance related to noise levels in the older children's area. A new area manager, with oversight for a number of Evolve services, was appointed in mid-2017. Professional support for the centre leaders and teachers has increased in this time and rebranding has occurred. The head teacher in the older children's area has recently returned from a time of leave.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers actively explore a spacious indoor and outdoor environment. Teachers in the younger children's area use positive teaching strategies that affirm their successes. Children in this area are settled and confident, they demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children up to three years old experience flexible routines that respond to their individual care needs. They are able to make choices and decisions about their own learning. Opportunities are provided for children to learn about early literacy and mathematics concepts through waiata, equipment and conversations. Recently some parents have shared their aspirations and developed meaningful goals in partnership with teachers. These good practices foster and promote children's social competencies and self-management skills</p><p>Children with identified learning needs are included and supported through appropriate support and guidance from outside agencies. Indoor and outdoor areas are spacious and invite exploration. The potential of these areas are yet to be recognised and maximised by leaders and teachers. To meet the needs of all children in the older children's area, teachers urgently need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build their knowledge about intentional practices that recognise and respond to children's individual emerging interests, language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understand and implement an individualised approach to planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and improve children's access to a wider range of good-quality resources and equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add complexity and extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give children greater access to a rich range of meaningful and authentic contexts for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>MƒÅori children would benefit from leaders and teachers further engaging in partnerships with whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi. In addition, developing and implementing a localised curriculum and strengthening bicultural practices is necessary to promote success for MƒÅori children. A particular strength are the opportunities for tuakana teina relationships as children choose to move between rooms to visit siblings and younger children.</p><p>Parents spoken to by ERO expressed appreciation for the many opportunities to communicate informally with teachers. Children, parents and their families are able to revisit and share their learning through individual portfolios, centre displays and online portfolios.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher's work in an open and respectful relationship. The head teacher in the younger children's area is a reflective practitioner. She has lead her team in the development of a shared understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation focused on individual children. The head teacher models teaching strategies appropriate for children up to three years of age. This is beginning to foster children's dispositional learning.</p><p>The area manager and centre manager work in a positive professional partnership to strengthen leadership capability across the centre. The area manager provides ongoing targeted mentoring for the centre manager. The head teacher in the older children's area is beginning to re-establish her leadership with her team after a time of leave. ERO and leaders agree that significant development and support is needed to strengthen centre management and professional leadership.</p><p>The new governance structure has improved the clarity of expectations, set a clear direction for centre improvement and strengthened the professional support for the centre manager and head teachers. Evolve Ltd has provided increased professional support for centre leaders and teachers in recent times. There is ongoing review and renewal of policies and guiding documentation to more closely align with regulatory requirements and best practice in early childhood education. Leaders and teachers need to fully enact these policies, particularly in relation to health and safety, and curriculum. Evolve also provide useful administrative support for the centre. Consideration should be given to including a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand as part of the umbrella organisation's values statement.</p><p>In order to improve learning outcomes for children urgent attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a philosophy and vision that reflects the aspirations of all stakeholders and honours MƒÅori as tangata whenua</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teachers understanding of integrating the language, culture and identity of all children into the curriculum, environment and teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalising opportunities for parents, families and teachers to meet and discuss priorities for children‚Äôs learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It is important to provide ongoing and centre-wide professional learning and development related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic self review and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving teaching practices, particularly for older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum design and delivery.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Adventures Te Puke completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement a suitable appraisal for all staff that meets the requirements of the New Zealand Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that there is at least 1 toilet for every 1-15 persons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a curriculum that acknowledge the unique place of MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop assessment, planning and evaluation that values the language, culture and identity of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give children greater access to a wider range of resources and equipment to enhance and extend their learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teacher's understanding of children's learning and development to promote social competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that policies and centre procedures are followed, particularly with regard to monitoring sleeping children and administration of medication</p>
</li>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
