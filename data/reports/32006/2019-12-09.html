</table><p>Ngatea Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ngatea Playcentre is a parent-cooperative early childhood service, located in the township of Ngatea. Many families come from the farming community surrounding the town. The service is licensed for 24 children, including 13 up to two years of age. There are two mixed-age morning sessions per week. Most parents remain with their children and share the responsibility of supervising them and running the centre.</p><p>Since the April 2016 ERO report, the centre has made some progress in relation to the key next steps, te ao MƒÅori and assessment, planning and evaluation. These continue to be areas to further develop.</p><p>During 2018 and 2019, Playcentre transitioned from operating as a federation, with 32 regional s that were individual legal entities, to becoming one national body, Playcentre Aotearoa. This was legally amalgamated in June 2019. Six new regional offices are moving to streamline and standardise support across the country. The Central North Island Region was created in November 2017 when eight associations merged. It covers a large geographical area with a total of 94 centres, both urban and rural.</p><p>The governing body has recently appointed a centre support worker and centre administrator to provide support for the parent-led committee of members at Ngatea Playcentre. Parent members fill the key committee roles at the playcentre.</p><p>Through its national philosophy, Playcentre Aotearoa places emphasis on 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together'. They empower adults and children to play, work and grow together and value and affirm parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a curriculum that is informed by the knowledge, interests and skills that they and their whƒÅnau bring to the centre. Children access a wide range of planned play activities and good quality resources. Child-initiated play empowers them to explore both indoor and outdoor environments with confidence. The environment fosters children's curiosity and promotes cooperative and independent learning experiences. High adult-to-child ratios help promote children's oral language and social competency. Early literacy and numeracy support children's learning. Children develop a strong sense of belonging at the centre.</p><p>Bicultural contexts for learning, celebrations and excursions enrich the programme. MƒÅori children are to some extent affirmed in their culture and identity. Leaders acknowledge this as an area to continue to strengthen.</p><p>Children up to the age of two are well supported by their parents and develop trusting relationships with other familiar adults. Home routines are responded to and their stages of development are nurtured.</p><p>Caring relationships with parents and trusting adults support positive learning outcomes for children. Experienced members model aspects of good practice and offer support and guidance to those new to the playcentre. Children's participation in the programme is documented in carefully presented profile books. Regular session evaluations provide useful summaries of learning and ideas for extending children's interests. The quality of assessment reflects the different levels of knowledge and experience among members. Assessment, planning and evaluation needs to be strengthened to highlight the links between children's interests, intentional planning and evaluation. Incorporating children's language, culture and identity in their learning assessment is a next step. The appointment of a centre support worker, and renewed adult training, should support this development and further strengthen members' knowledge of New Zealand's early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em></p><p>Leadership promotes a strong sense of partnership and collaboration. There is a wide range of skills and experience among leaders. A positive team culture for learning is fostered through open communication and high levels of relational trust. Many members are engaged in training. Most office positions are filled, with some entry level roles available for new members. Leaders are focused on building capability and capacity of the centre at all levels. Induction of new members carefully outlines the roles and responsibilities of the centre. A 'duty buddy-up' system and well-planned handover process contributes to centre sustainability and improvement. Self review is spontaneous, and documentation continues to be developed. Leaders recognise the need to strengthen this area to be more strategic and aligned to the new national directives.</p><p>During the transition period there is some overlap between associations and the new national or regional systems and processes. National policies and an online management tool are currently being delivered throughout the new region. Management need to ensure that support is in place for local centres to fully implement these. A revised adult education training course has recently been offered across the region to support adults grow their capabilities and knowledge. The overarching strategic plan, philosophy and vision of Playcentre Aotearoa and individual annual plans have been implemented and guide direction.</p><p>A particular strength of Playcentre Aotearoa is the two-house model initiative for governance. Te Whare Tikanga MƒÅori promotes self-determination for MƒÅori members. This national initiative is yet to impact on practice for MƒÅori learners at Ngatea Playcentre as members continue to strengthen bicultural practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Ngatea Playcentre are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to make clear the links between children's interests, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori practices and knowledge of local MƒÅori history and legends to enrich the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>members' shared knowledge and understanding of New Zealand's early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>New support and professional development is in place for the centre. Those in governance and local members should continue to strengthen their relationships and align systems and processes to the new national directives.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ngatea Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, ongoing vigilance and monitoring of potential hazards is needed. Since the on-site phase of ERO's evaluation, the playcentre has provided evidence that items that could topple and electric sockets are secured. Additionally, members should seek advice from Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island and/or the Ministry of Education about plants on site that could be unsafe for children at certain times of the year.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>9 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
