</table><p>Buttercups Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Buttercups Preschool is a small, privately-owned centre that provides education and care for children from two years to school age. The centre has been operating for 18 months   in a purpose-built building. This is its first Education Review.</p><p>The centre’s vision and philosophy focus on providing a vibrant, warm, family-oriented environment. Children are provided with nutritious meals and snacks each day. Positive, friendly relationships contribute to the family-like environment. Each child and family is well supported by a key teacher. They share useful information between the family and the centre.</p><p>The teaching staff are well qualified and children have a higher than required level of supervision.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Many aspects of the centre’s philosophy are evident in the programme.</p><p>Children experience caring, respectful relationships with each other and with teachers and support staff. These relationships strongly support their sense of belonging. Children are confident communicators and highly competent to lead their own learning. They are familiar with the centre routines and willingly help to tidy the rooms.</p><p>Teachers naturally integrate literacy, mathematics, music, movement and te reo Māori into the programme. Some teachers use te reo Māori confidently and well in their conversations with children.</p><p>Teachers plan a good range of activities to engage children and extend their thinking, problem solving and self-help skills. Teachers are highly focused on supporting children’s learning. They have developed an extension programme to meet the needs of older children. The extension activities are carefully linked to the children’s interests and further development of their skills. Teachers provide an inclusive environment where children’s cultural backgrounds are celebrated. Children with special needs are nurtured and well supported.</p><p>The centre manager presents high quality analysis of self- review projects. This information is effectively used to improve teacher practice. Centre leaders recognise and use the strengths of the staff to support children’s learning and development. They seek and use the ideas and opinions offered by children, staff and parents to promote ongoing improvement. Leaders encourage a collaborative approach to self review, assessment, planning and evaluation. This is building a shared understanding of the centre’s processes.</p><p>The staff are well supported by the centre manager and the licensee. The centre manager has effectively led the management team to develop and implement:</p><ul>
<li>a clear strategic direction for the service</li>
<li>an effective self- review process that is clearly focused on ongoing improvement</li>
<li>policy statements that provide clear guidelines for staff</li>
<li>clear expectations that support children’s health, safety and wellbeing</li>
<li>a useful appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree, that the next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing opportunities for children to contribute to the programme</li>
<li>clarifying and extending the strategic plan to provide clear direction and priorities for achieving the centre’s vision</li>
<li>developing the appraisal process to include formal observations and evidence-based criteria</li>
<li>making sure the evaluative aspects of self review are consistently applied over all reviews.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Buttercups Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Buttercups Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
