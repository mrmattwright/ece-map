</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Green Island Kindergarten provides education and care for children aged from two years to school age in a modern purpose-built building. Recently more two year olds have begun to attend. The kindergarten is open for school-day hours. Some of the younger children go home at lunchtime, so forty children attend in the morning and thirty in the afternoon.</p><p>All the teachers are qualified. A parent committee supports the kindergarten with fundraising and improvements. The teachers have made good progress on the recommendations from the 2012 ERO report.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the Dunedin Kindergartens (DK) umbrella. DK provides management and professional support for the teachers. This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The children have warm and trusting relationships with their teachers. Children develop good friendships and the teachers encourage them to care for one another. The children know the routines well and act independently, making their own decisions about what to do. They are encouraged to take on leadership and learn how to care for themselves.</p><p>The children play in a settled way, often for quite long periods at one activity. This allows the teachers to devote uninterrupted time to small groups of children. The teachers have conversations with children that foster their curiosity and build their oral language skills and confidence. Children frequently take part in dramatic play that also builds their oral language. Throughout the day there are many other opportunities for early-literacy learning.</p><p>As more two-year olds have started attending the kindergarten, the teachers have adapted their programme and resources. For the younger children they emphasise establishing a strong sense of belonging. It would now be worth reviewing how well the programme and practices cater for two-year olds. In the kindergarten philosophy children are valued for their uniqueness. The kindergarten philosophy statement would be more useful if it set out clearly what is valued learning at this kindergarten.</p><p>The outside play area is imaginatively designed and offers plenty of scope for different levels of physical challenge. It includes a bike track, climbing wall, vegetable garden and native plantings. The inside area is also attractive and well thought out. There are a wide range of activities available to children and they have independent access to resources and equipment.</p><p>The teachers have sometimes used kaupapa Māori concepts such as whanaungatanga (connectedness and relationships) to help guide their group plans. This year the older children have attended the Polyfest. The children’s profile books show that the teachers value the culture and identity of Māori and Pacific children. Parents are encouraged to bring their own cultural knowledge into the kindergarten. The teachers have noted that they will continue to strengthen Māori perspectives in the programme.</p><p>Teachers build trusting relationships with parents in order to support their children’s learning. They work with specialist agencies where this is needed. The kindergarten is directly opposite Green Island School. The kindergarten and school have developed a close relationship in order to help children transition to school smoothly. The kindergarten teachers are continuing to make closer connections with other local schools.</p><p>The teachers have developed a very successful system for planning for children’s learning. They regularly discuss children’s learning with parents and incorporate parents’ wishes into the individual plans. The children’s profile books are an attractive record of their experiences at the kindergarten and often show the progress of children’s learning over time. Clearer definition of teaching strategies would strengthen planning further.</p><p>Under the leadership of the experienced head teacher, the teaching team has developed strong systems to ensure the smooth operation of the kindergarten. The teachers share responsibilities and contribute their own strengths. They have a useful format for self review and self review has led to some positive changes. They can now pay greater attention to the use of indicators for effective self review.</p><p>The kindergarten’s long-term plan concentrates on property issues. It would be valuable for the kindergarten community to identify goals for the kindergarten’s future related to learning and teaching, and detail and monitor the actions to achieve these.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and ERO agree that a key next step for teachers, with the support of the senior teacher, is to clearly articulate what is valued learning in this kindergarten. They should involve the kindergarten community in this process and then write it into the philosophy statement. In time, they should then review their programme and practices against the philosophy statement.</p><p>They should also strengthen self-review practices by making more effective use of indicators and developing a schedule for review that covers all aspects of teaching and learning over time.</p><p>Other next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build Māori perspectives in the programme</li>
<li>strengthen their planning for children’s learning by clearly articulating teaching strategies and learning experiences</li>
<li>review how well the programme and practices cater for two-year olds</li>
<li>identify long-term priorities for the kindergarten relating to learning and teaching, and detail and monitor the actions to achieve these.</li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive are evaluative, show how well the DK’s vision and goals are met, and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent, high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the DK.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Green Island Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Green Island Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 December 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
