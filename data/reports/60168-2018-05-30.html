</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Petone Early Learning Centre offers all day education and care for up to 36 children aged over two years. The current roll of 43 children includes six Samoan children and five Asian children. Significant roll growth has occurred over the past three years.</p><p>The recent reorganisation of Barnardos New Zealand, is focused on an integrated systems and processes to focus on the quality of teaching and children's outcomes. The regional manager and practice advisor provide regular support and quality assurance to the head teacher and staff. This supports centre operation and identifies areas of strength and next steps for development.</p><p>The head teacher oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre and together with a core group of teachers provides continuity for children and their whƒÅnau. The centre is participating in professional learning and development to fully implement their response to the refreshed early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki (</em>2017<em>).</em></p><p>The March 2015 ERO report identified that regular programme evaluation, analysis of assessment to identify children's learning and increasing knowledge and understanding of self review were next steps. This external evaluation recognises that some improvements are evident in these areas and remain ongoing areas for further growth.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are viewed as confident and competent learners, which is a key aspect of the Barnardos early learning centre philosophy. They are encouraged to self-manage and to take responsibility within the centre's flexible routines. Sustained play by individuals and groups of children is fostered by responsive teaching practices. Each child's needs and interests are known and valued.</p><p>A recent internal evaluation on promoting children's social and emotional competency has strengthened teachers' shared understandings of this key teaching practice. The unhurried and respectful manner of teachers enables children to make choices and to lead their learning. This includes supporting physical activity and enjoyment of the nature and sustainable practices through gardening.</p><p>Participation in a teacher-led innovation fund research about transitions for school has increased shared knowledge about good practices for children and their families.</p><p>Reviews of the centre environment and resources are informed by what best empowers children to lead their learning and play. The recent redevelopment of the centre gardens provided a valuable platform to increase connections with the wider local community, parents and families and to incorporate children's ideas into the design. Families, whƒÅnau and aiga are warmly welcomed and valued as partners in their children's learning.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori continues to be visible in the programme. Children and staff understand their pepeha, aspects of tikanga and enjoy waiata. Children's regular use of te reo MƒÅori is well modelled by most staff.</p><p>Responsive provisions for Pacific families remain a centre focus. Pacific staff celebrate the diversity of Pacific cultures and children experience learning that affirms their identity.</p><p>Teachers assess and share children's learning through an online digital platform that enables parents to share their response to new learning and aspirations for their children. Continuing to strengthen teachers' analyses of assessment should assist them to evaluate how well centre teaching strategies contribute to improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The understandings about teacher appraisal and its implementation have improved over time. The newly developed system to work with the standards of the teaching profession meet the Education Council guidelines. Continuing to support teachers to confidently share their evidence and to set improvement goals that better link to outcomes for children is a next step.</p><p>The head teacher and staff understand and are more confident in using internal evaluation for improvement. Strengthening the focus on outcomes for children, based on well-analysed evidence should further improve practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The regional manager, practice advisor and head teacher agree that the following key next steps focus on developing greater understanding of outcomes for children, by continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the analysis of assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve shared understanding and implementation of the revised teacher appraisal process and internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Petone Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Petone Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>30 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
