</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coast Kindy on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, is governed by the Bay of Whales Children's Trust. It provides full-day education and care for up to 30 children aged over two years. Learning programmes are guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, strongly influenced by Reggio Emilia approaches and underpinned by Christian values. The centre promotes a home-like environment with a supportive, family focus and continues to focus on providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all.</p><p>The centre is on the site of the Whangaparaoa Baptist Church and was previously named Whangaparaoa Baptist Community Kindergarten. It was re-named in 2017 to align with several other 'Coast' services that the Church operates, promoting the wellbeing and care of the local community in Whangaparaoa.</p><p>While there has been some staff turnover since the 2015 ERO review, the new supervisor and assistant supervisors are long-standing staff members. A 'family worker' is an integral member of the team, providing an extra home-centre link.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted many good practices, including family engagement, positive relationships and provision for children's play. Areas for further development included more in-depth self review, teacher performance appraisal and professional development, and assessment of children's learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. As they participate and actively learn with others, they demonstrate positive and caring, tuakana/teina relationships. Older children naturally guide and support their younger friends. Children are confident to offer and seek help from others. There is a busy and purposeful atmosphere of enjoyment, and a harmonious, settled tone.</p><p>Flexible programmes celebrate and promote children's interests and strengths. Opportunities to try new experiences, make mistakes and solve problems are key elements of the programme. The pace and flow of play is dictated by the individual child, providing authentic and meaningful learning opportunities.</p><p>The centre layout is interesting, providing a range of spaces and resources to explore. Learning opportunities are wide-ranging and engaging. Teachers provoke children's curiosity and imagination. Children are encouraged to position and rearrange resources to suit their play purposes. There is a good range of physical challenges and creative prompts. Natural and found objects feature strongly. Literacy and mathematical concepts are woven meaningfully through hands-on learning. Beach walks also integrate the natural local environment into the programme.</p><p>Teachers closely observe children at play to judge appropriate moments to enhance learning. They demonstrate a deep interest in, and respect for children's discoveries and wonderings, and their creations. Teachers provide appropriate challenge, stimulate growing independence and foster deeper understanding and engagement. Well placed displays and materials allow children to reflect, revisit and build upon prior knowledge and experiences.</p><p>The teaching team works collaboratively to assess learning and plan for individual children. Families are seen as partners in this collaboration. Their sharing of information and aspirations helps teachers to actively respond to each child. Teachers are also using digital platforms successfully for extending communication with families. Learning stories could now be strengthened to reflect the individualised planning that teachers discuss and develop in team meetings.</p><p>Teachers weave te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, and place-based learning, through the centre programme and culture. They foster connections for children and whƒÅnau. It is now timely to celebrate the Coast Kindy commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi more overtly in its strategic mission, vision, values and philosophy. This could support the team to review practice and set goals in partnership with whƒÅnau.</p><p>Leaders work diligently to enhance operations at all levels. There is a shared sense of purpose and an understanding of roles and responsibilities for achieving strategic goals. New action plans have been developed by the team to guide centre-wide improvement. Supervisors are keen to formally evaluate the impact of their work on outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders continue to enhance internal evaluation practices so that teachers, parents and the board all have a growing voice in decision-making for improvement. Key information is gathered to guide strategic review, action planning and inquiry. Leaders promote curriculum improvements and the development of key goals in a planned, purposeful manner. Teachers are well supported through professional development to inquire into their practice and to continue to enhance and refine these key aspects of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Agreed priorities for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing and refining strategic documents to incorporate a bicultural commitment, goals and actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making planned teaching strategies and their impact more visible in learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of centre action plans on outcomes for children and families.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coast Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coast Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
