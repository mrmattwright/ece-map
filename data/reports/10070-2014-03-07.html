</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Our Space on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula provides full day education and care and is licensed for 30 children, including infants and toddlers, and children up to school age. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum, and aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophies continue to underpin programmes. Families identify that they have mainly New Zealand European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, MƒÅori and Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre is led by the owner/manager. Staff are all qualified teachers and they continue to work collaboratively to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>In 2011, ERO recommended that the new owners continue to focus on improvements to management systems, learning programmes and the environment and property. Significant progress has been made in many areas, particularly the environment and learning programmes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Our Space benefit from the warm, caring relationships that are evident through their interactions with teachers. Emphasis has been placed on developing children‚Äôs social competence. Children develop strong friendships with each other. When children interact in mixed age groups there is a strong sense of tuakana-teina (learning partnerships between younger and older learners) and siblings enjoy being with each other. Children have fun together and with teachers. Teachers cater well for the specific needs of infants and toddlers and set up environments that respond to their needs and interests.</p><p>Responsive and caring relationships underpin the centre‚Äôs welcoming tone. Parents appreciate the sense of family and the individual attention children receive from teachers. They receive good information about their children's learning and are encouraged to take an active part in the centre programme and events.</p><p>The programme responds to children‚Äôs emerging interests. Teachers build on children‚Äôs ideas. They make good use of open-ended questioning that encourages children‚Äôs thinking and exploration. Children‚Äôs language skills are extended through meaningful play and sustained conversations with their teachers. The unhurried pace in the centre allows children to express themselves and direct their own learning. Teachers agree that they could further develop strategies to consistently increase the complexity of children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, good progress has been made in assessment and planning. The centre manager has identified the need for further professional learning and development in this area.</p><p>The centre manager provides good leadership and models effective teaching practice. Shared leadership and areas of responsibility enable teachers to work collaboratively. Staff are committed to reflective practices that support ongoing improvement. Parents are included in decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders discussed how more effective self review could enhance the centre‚Äôs direction. ERO affirms the centre‚Äôs priorities for improving outcomes for children. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to investigate ways to further promote success for MƒÅori and demonstrate the centre‚Äôs commitment to New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage</li>
<li>further develop and document self review to monitor and focus on the impact and effectiveness of processes and practices, curriculum and learning, and progress towards goals</li>
<li>more clearly align strategic and annual planning, centre philosophy, teacher appraisal, and professional learning and development</li>
<li>undertake regular policy review to ensure alignment between policy and centre practices.</li>
</ul><p>ERO supports the manager‚Äôs intention to access external support to develop whole-centre understanding of effective self review.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers would benefit from support to develop a robust system of performance management that focuses on improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Our Space Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To comply with legal requirements, the owner/manager should now ensure that:</p><ol>
<li>all staff are included in a system of robust, regular appraisal<br>¬†<em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 2008, R47, Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992]</em></li>
<li>accurate processes and documentation guides police vetting for all non-teaching staff¬†<br><em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 2008, R44, Education Act 1989, s12]</em></li>
<li>centre documentation clearly shows how all legal requirements around trips and excursions are met<br><em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 2008, R46, Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17].</em></li>
</ol><p>ERO and leaders discussed the need to improve the documentation and review of; hazards, accidents, the dispensing of medicine to children and earthquake and fire drills. The centre‚Äôs child protection policy could also be improved by making reference to provision for protected disclosures.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Our Space Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>7 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
