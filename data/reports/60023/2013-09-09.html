</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stokes Valley Playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development, and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association’s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>This centre operates five mixed-age sessions weekly. Sessions are fully parent-led. In the summer months, if there are sufficient older children, an extended session is offered. The majority of members undertake Playcentre training with high numbers attaining Course 2 (Te Puna) and Course 3 (Te Manga) Certificates.</p><p>The centre philosophy is currently under review. It emphasises the importance of Playcentre values, such as adults learning alongside their children.</p><p>Since the August 2009 ERO report there has been considerable refurbishment and re-organisation. The centre was relicensed in February under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. It has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Members’ inclusive and well-considered practices support good learning opportunities for children. Adults are responsive to children’s interests and are actively involved in their play. They are positive and respectful and promote a sense of fun as part of learning. Families from a range of cultures are welcomed and given support where English is not a first language. Children are settled and show a sense of belonging. They are confident to ask questions of adults.</p><p>The environment effectively supports children’s exploration and confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of resources which are freely available for children. These include a good range of natural materials. The outdoor area supports physical play and adventurous activities.</p><p>Adults are purposeful in supporting children’s learning. Creativity and self expression are encouraged. Aspects of early literacy, numeracy and natural science are integrated into activities. Shared musical experiences are a strong feature of the daily routine. Adults should explore further ways to foster children’s self management skills and encourage conversations that extend oral language at social meal times. Members have identified that developing strategies and relationships to support effective transition to school will become more of a focus as increasing numbers of older children are retained.</p><p>Children aged up to two years actively engage in the programme. They are considered in planning for learning. A family atmosphere is apparent, especially in the way all members care for infants and toddlers.</p><p>A Māori perspective is evident in the centre environment. Members, with the active support of a bicultural officer, continue to develop their understanding and use of Māori language and protocols.</p><p>Centre members have clear systems for planning the programme. Through daily discussion and termly meetings, they collaboratively share and analyse children’s learning and contribute ideas for the future programme. Learning records are well presented, showing aspects of children’s participation and learning at playcentre. Adults have recently been trialling a different approach to observing children’s play. This should give increased insight into the individual strengths, interests and progress of children over time.</p><p>The friendly, supportive culture and well-developed communication foster parents’ confidence and willingness to become involved. Adults take pride in being part of a learning community alongside their children. Families display a strong sense of belonging and commitment to Playcentre philosophy. They work collaboratively and bring a wide range of expertise to their roles. This collegial approach, with co-sharing of roles and tasks, supports further training and emergent leadership.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members’ practice. A more formalised approach, focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It effectively works alongside members to support self management. Self review is valued and strongly promoted. Members make good use of the association frameworks which guide review and reflective practice at centre level. Members have identified the need to review and develop their strategic plan in line with their refreshed centre philosophy. They are also aware that planned, in-depth self review can be strengthened further.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members need to:</p><ul>
<li>further strengthen assessment for learning by: - continuing to improve the quality and consistency of learning records - enhancing children’s ownership of their portfolios by making them more accessible</li>
<li>further develop their shared understanding and use of self review. A focus on association frameworks that build on quality improvement should strengthen members' approach to self review</li>
<li>continue to find ways to include te ao Māori within the curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stokes Valley Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stokes Valley Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
