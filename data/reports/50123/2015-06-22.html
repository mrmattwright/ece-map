</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz is a privately owned and operated centre located close to the central business area in Palmerston North. The service offers all day care and education. It caters for 40 children, including 10 aged up to two years, in a separate learning area.</p><p>The September 2013 ERO report, identified a number of areas where management were not compliant with their regulatory requirements and a need to strengthen management and leadership practice. ERO’s evaluation determined the service required further development to promote positive outcomes for children. ERO recommended centre management consult with the Ministry of Education (the Ministry) to plan to address the key issues and actions identified. The Ministry assisted the centre owner to develop an action plan to respond to the concerns raised. The Ministry provided external support to do this and build management capability.</p><p>ERO revisited the centre during October 2014 to ascertain what progress had been made. ERO recognised that systems and processes were in the very early stages of development. The priority for development continued to be, improving the leading of teaching to provide a more responsive curriculum for children. Some changes to staffing have occurred since ERO’s previous visit. This included the centre owner employing a head teacher in May 2015, to lead curriculum and teacher development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner and teaching staff have made good progress in improving centre operations. Some work is still required to further improve the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>ERO’s September 2013 Education Review Report reported that</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers know children well, are respectful and affirming and use questioning and modelling of language to support children’s developing literacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children play independently and alongside each other developing their physical skills, experimenting and using their imaginations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good information sharing between parents and staff help infants and toddlers' establish a sense of belonging.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This 2015 evaluation confirms these positive practices have been sustained.</p><p>Planned and spontaneous experiences for children are becoming more responsive to children’s interests as a result of review of the service’s philosophy and curriculum. Leaders and teachers are clearer about the desired outcomes they seek for children. Ongoing review of the philosophy demonstrates aspects of the curriculum are becoming an integral feature of children’s early childhood experience at the centre.</p><p>The incorporation of te ao Māori within the programme has been enhanced as a result of increased teacher knowledge and confidence.</p><p>Improvement has been made to operating systems and processes with support from the Ministry. External professional learning has assisted the manager and staff to better understand their responsibilities. Steady progress continues against the service’s development plan. Self review for improvement is understood and several reviews have been undertaken. This foundation work positions leaders well to prioritise developments, monitor progress and improve service provision.</p><p>The centre owner and head teacher have reviewed the annual plan and recognise this should be further developed to promote sustainable practice and ongoing improvement. ERO’s evaluation confirms this as a next step for development.</p><p>Human resource management practice is established. Although a full cycle of appraisal has not been completed, steady progress has been made. The process is developmental. Teachers are highly reflective practitioners and are better placed to monitor how their new learning can influence the centre curriculum.</p><p>Teaching staff continue to increase their knowledge of effective teaching practice and reflect on how this responds to individual children’s strengths, interests and needs. The Ministry’s ongoing support to mid 2015 should further enhance teachers’ practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Continue to implement the service’s development plans.</p><p>Determine a point in time to evaluate their impact on improving outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Leaders should also ensure agreed teaching practice underpins the reviewed centre philosophy and determines curriculum priorities and emphases. Developing a shared philosophy for teaching and learning for the service’s youngest children should be a further consideration.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified that in order to improve practice the centre owner should improve her understanding of privacy principles and guidelines and ensure centre practices are aligned to this information.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 June 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
