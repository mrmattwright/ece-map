</table><p>Learn a Lot Kindy Kidz requires support to improve the quality of: leadership; performance management and appraisal; teaching and learning; and internal evaluation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz is privately owned and located near the central business district of Palmerston¬†North. The service has 50 children, including 10 aged up to two years, in a separate learning area. It offers all day care and education. At the time of this review, 13 children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre owner is responsible for the governance and management of the centre. She is also in charge of the day-to-day running of the centre and works as a full time teacher for two days.</p><p>The majority of teachers have been appointed in 2018. A teacher has been appointed to be second in charge. Two teachers are provisionally registered and another is in the final year of training.</p><p>The June 2015 ERO report identified as areas to progress: continuing to implement the service's development plans; evaluating the impact on improving outcomes for children and their families; and further developing the annual plan to promote ongoing improvement. These areas continue to require development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in learning experiences that invite engagement through interest, challenge and opportunities to explore. They demonstrate confidence, independent learning, tuakana teina relationships and characteristics of perseverance. Infants and toddlers are settled, moving with confidence in the environments. Their self-help skills are encouraged.</p><p>Children have opportunities to celebrate their language, culture and identity. Te ao MƒÅori is visible through pepeha, te reo MƒÅori, kupu MƒÅori throughout the environment, artefacts and waiata MƒÅori. Narratives reference Pacific rituals, language and celebrations.</p><p>Children's profiles include narratives that show some progression in learning, dispositions and links to <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>. Photos, records of special events and celebrations are also included. Individual and group stories are shared. This includes recognising individual children‚Äôs interests, preferences and strengths to contribute to group planning. Staff should continue to develop the introduced assessment framework to improve the quality of teaching through intentional teaching and include strategies that add complexity to children's thinking and ideas. These can then be reflected in children's individual learning records.</p><p>Leaders identify strengthening relationships with parents and whƒÅnau as a next step. E-profiles have been introduced and are in the initial stages of development. These provide further opportunities for parent and whƒÅnau input. Communication with parents about children's wellbeing and progress is shared regularly face-to-face, in photographs and to some extent in profiles. Parent and whƒÅnau aspirations are not yet recorded to contribute to children's learning. ERO's evaluation confirms the need to strengthen learning partnerships with parents.</p><p>Systematically building leadership and teaching capability through professional learning and appraisal is a key and significant need. Centre leadership is new this year, as are most staff. The appraisal process for staff is in its first cycle. Two provisionally registered teachers require high quality mentoring. The external appraisal of the head teacher is not aligned to the centre process. Appraisal was an area for improvement in the September 2013 ERO report. The June ERO 2015 noted that although steady progress has been made, a full cycle of appraisal had not been completed.</p><p>Areas key to high quality teaching and improved learning outcomes for children are not well developed or evident. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a sound induction process for teachers new to the centre, in training and provisionally registered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a formalised appraisal agreement with the external appraiser of the head teacher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an appraisal process that includes goal setting discussions, observations, reflections, evaluation of progress and an annual summary document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cohesive self review for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation and how this contributes to developing high quality practice and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve practice and bring about and sustain change, the manager and staff need to develop their understanding of and practices in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teaching and learning, including strengthening learning partnerships with whƒÅnau and parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provision for advice and guidance of beginning teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership capability in a deliberate, systematic manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation, to know the impact of teachers‚Äô practices on children‚Äôs learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring that it is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including review practices.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learn A Lot Kindy Kidz will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services <span>Central Region</span></p><p>14 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
