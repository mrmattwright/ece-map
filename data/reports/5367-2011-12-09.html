<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Ngaio Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>A recent positive initiative is Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s Criteria for Curriculum Implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p>
<p>The values and beliefs expressed in the kindergarten philosophy statement are reflected in practice. Teachers present a welcoming and stimulating environment where children are listened to and respected.</p>
<p>Children participate in a high quality programme that is based around their interests and growing independence. Teachers use a range of successful strategies to extend children&rsquo;s learning and acknowledge them as capable and confident learners. The learning environment provides an appropriate level of challenge for all children. Their sense of belonging and well-being is fostered.</p>
<p>Respectful, reciprocal relationships between teachers, children and parents are valued. The kindergarten committee is an energetic parent body that works cooperatively with staff to support long-term and daily operation.</p>
<p>Teaching staff are in the early stages of implementing Te Manawa. When embedded, these guidelines should assist in strengthening assessment and curriculum implementation. Teachers have identified that an area for further development is evidence-based self review. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation concurs with this direction.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Ngaio Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atNgaio Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4><em>Background</em></h4>
<p>Since the May 2008 ERO review the teaching team has changed and increased in size. Despite the changes teaching staff have continued to maintain an effective programme for children and build relationships with wh&#257;nau. There have been ongoing improvements made to the outdoor area, with strong support from the kindergarten committee.</p>
<p>In October 2010 the kindergarten changed to an all day licence. Six hour sessions are offered three days per week for the older children, with those younger able to attend for two mornings per week. This reorganisation has improved teacher/child ratios.</p>
<p>At the time of this 2011 review the teaching team was newly established.</p>
<h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4>
<p>Programme</p>
<p>The learning programme is underpinned by the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy which views children as confident and competent learners. Teachers draw on a range of strategies to effectively engage children in the programme and extend their learning. The programme provided is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests, enables children to practise new skills, be appropriately challenged and experience success.</p>
<p>Learning experiences are provided in a way that captures children&rsquo;s interests, draws them in and helps them sustain their play. Many opportunities are available for children to express themselves through music, art and drama.</p>
<p>Routines are flexible and well established and allow children to develop independence. Children actively participate in these and teachers capitalise on opportunities presented to further children&rsquo;s learning. Te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori are valued and evident throughout the programme of learning.</p>
<p>Teachers are reflective practitioners and know children and their families well. They are deliberate in their teaching and reflect on the impact this has for children.</p>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
<p>Teachers purposefully use children&rsquo;s interests and views to inform the planned programme. Leadership opportunities are promoted through this approach. They ensure that the learning opportunities provided broaden children&rsquo;s experiences and add challenge and complexity to their learning.</p>
<p>Portfolios are well presented and informative. They are readily accessible to children and wh&#257;nau. A narrative approach is used to highlight children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme and their developing friendships. Parent and child contributions are reflected through the portfolios.</p>
<p>Interactions</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s learning and engagement in the programme are actively supported through warm, responsive and respectful interactions. Teachers know children well within the context of their families. They engage children in conversations that prompt their curiosity and imagination. Rich, descriptive language is used by teachers as a strategy to develop children&rsquo;s ideas and communicate expectations.</p>
<p>Teachers are collaborative and supportive of each other and model these attributes to individuals. Parents and teachers work in partnership to improve outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Children relate well to others through cooperative, supportive and trusting relationships. They engage confidently with each other.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s well-being and sense of belonging are effectively fostered. They can easily access indoor and outdoor spaces that invite exploration and extend the curriculum. Teachers provide a range of equipment and resources that vary in complexity and challenge.</p>
<p>Many opportunities are available for children and wh&#257;nau to revisit prior learning, for example through wall displays. Collaborative and quiet spaces are available for use throughout the day. A calm and purposeful atmosphere is evident.</p>
<h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
<p>Teachers and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation identified that assessment documentation could be further developed by providing entries that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>are completed more regularly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly analyse the actual learning taking place for the individual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more frequently show planned and implemented strategies to extend children&rsquo;s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>draw links between entries to provide a sense of continuity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This should make children&rsquo;s learning and progress clear for parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>Self review</p>
<p>Spontaneous review has been well used by teachers to improve outcomes for children. Implementing a process of evidence-based self review requires further development. This should be achieved by following the guidelines set out by the association.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4><em>Background</em></h4>
<p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4>
<p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>the strategic plan, setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4>
<p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen their support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</p>
</li>

<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4>
<p>Teachers work in partnership with wh&#257;nau to provide access to outside agencies and offer ongoing support for children with special learning needs.</p>
<p>Teachers are responsive to the interests and needs of identified children. Inclusive practices are modelled by teachers to ensure that all children are valued members of the wider kindergarten group. A range of strategies is used to ensure clear communication with wh&#257;nau about the child&rsquo;s day at kindergarten. Extended hours have resulted in smoother transitions into and out of the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers work with wh&#257;nau, the education support worker and outside agencies to plan appropriate programmes. Children&rsquo;s learning is supported through the implementation of their individual development plan.</p>
<h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4>
<p>Teachers have identified that processes to assist children with moderate to severe special learning needs transition to school requires strengthening.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>

<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-ngaio-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Ngaio Kindergarten</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Ngaio Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Ngaio Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>A recent positive initiative is Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s Criteria for Curriculum Implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p>
<p>The values and beliefs expressed in the kindergarten philosophy statement are reflected in practice. Teachers present a welcoming and stimulating environment where children are listened to and respected.</p>
<p>Children participate in a high quality programme that is based around their interests and growing independence. Teachers use a range of successful strategies to extend children&rsquo;s learning and acknowledge them as capable and confident learners. The learning environment provides an appropriate level of challenge for all children. Their sense of belonging and well-being is fostered.</p>
<p>Respectful, reciprocal relationships between teachers, children and parents are valued. The kindergarten committee is an energetic parent body that works cooperatively with staff to support long-term and daily operation.</p>
<p>Teaching staff are in the early stages of implementing Te Manawa. When embedded, these guidelines should assist in strengthening assessment and curriculum implementation. Teachers have identified that an area for further development is evidence-based self review. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation concurs with this direction.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
