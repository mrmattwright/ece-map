</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maori Hill Montessori Preschool is a small, privately-owned education and care service. It is licensed for 30 children over the age of two and up to school age.</p><p>The team of teachers have a shared understanding of the centre philosophy and how it works in practice. They effectively incorporate the principles, strands and goals of the Te Whāriki early childhood curriculum with the Montessori approach and experiences.</p><p>The service has made good progress with the recommendations in the June 2014 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a calm, well-organised environment designed to support their learning. They enjoy positive relationships with teachers and each other. Children are encouraged to take increased responsibility for themselves and their learning. They are capable and confident, and work alone and together in a respectful manner. Their views are sought and valued. They approach adults knowing they can rely on their support and that teachers will be consistent in their expectations.</p><p>Teachers work effectively together to support the strengths, abilities and interests of each individual child. This includes valuing and celebrating children's cultural similarities and differences. Children’s progress across the curriculum and with Montessori learning objectives is closely monitored. The programme and teaching are highly focused on children’s literacy and mathematics learning. Teachers use questioning and other useful strategies to encourage children’s language development. They use a variety of approaches and resources to successfully support children with English as a second language.</p><p>Children's learning benefits from the many opportunities to learn about New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. The teachers have added a Māori perspective to documents and this prompts teachers into growing and extending bicultural practice within the centre. Waiata, karakia, te reo and tikanga Māori practices are used regularly. The tuakana-teina concept of learning is promoted and used well. Teachers acknowledge that the integration of Māori perspectives is ongoing learning for themselves as well as for the children, and this is planned for.</p><p>Useful systems ensure and maintain a high focus on children’s learning. Records of learning show that the teachers know the children very well. Planning for children's learning is specific. Evaluations show how teachers have facilitated learning and how teachers will support the next steps of learning.</p><p>The relationship between parents and teachers has a strong educational focus and links home and centre life. Teachers consult with parents to hear their aspirations for their children’s learning and how they can work together to achieve goals. Teachers are proactive in finding the right resources and best approach to meeting the needs of individual children, including those with diverse needs.</p><p>The service is well managed. The leaders encourage a collaborative team approach. They have established good systems to support teachers to reflect and critique their practice and use their individual strengths and talents. Teachers support one another to keep up to date with current theories.</p><p>The centre leaders and teachers are improvement focused. They use self-review processes to support the ongoing development of the service and its priorities. These reviews have been useful and have had positive outcomes. The centre's next step is to strengthen the evaluative aspect of reviews to continually build quality.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for the leaders and teachers are to continue the development of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation/self-review practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maori Hill Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maori Hill Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>23 August 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
