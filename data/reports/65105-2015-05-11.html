</table><p>Mapua Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mapua Playcentre operates under the guidance of the Nelson Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative. Parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and centre operation. A feature of Nelson Playcentres is the provision of a whānau room. These rooms are well used by parents to, rest, socialise, to care for very young children and participate in training.</p><p>Mapua Playcentre offers two mixed-age-group sessions per week. The supervisors hold playcentre qualifications. Most of the parents have also completed a number of the playcentre parent-training courses.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, the association has effectively supported the parent cooperative to make significant progress, particularly with leadership and operational procedures.</p><p>Parents have made good progress with the use of self review to develop child assessment and programme planning and a stronger profile in the community.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 reviews in the Nelson Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging to the centre. The supervisors and parents are welcoming, inclusive and responsive to all children’s needs.</p><p class="TableParagraph">The playcentre environment is well organised, attractively presented and richly resourced. The indoor and outdoor areas are spacious and support play for infants, toddlers and young children. Activities are attractively displayed and children’s learning is celebrated. </p><p>The supervision team provides strong leadership and support to parents on session. The supervisors use effective ways to evaluate children’s learning. Parents are active members of the parent cooperative and have a shared understanding of the playcentre philosophy. Parents are well supported with workshop training.</p><p>Parents of Māori children confidently express their aspirations for their children to succeed as Māori. These aspirations are linked to children’s learning within the programme. Parents are keen to become more confident and competent to use te reo Māori and understand tikanga Māori in the session. The supervisors and parents have provided a range of useful prompts and bicultural resources to support children’s learning.</p><p>Children’s learning is regularly evaluated and linked to programme planning and session activities. Evaluations effectively include children’s and parents' ideas about children’s progress and learning.</p><p>Children have close contact with the local community. This includes planned visits to the local school, community events and library.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association, supervisors and parents identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to increase the inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori and the involvement of Māori families in the programme</li>
<li>continue to develop leadership</li>
<li>sustain and build on recent developments including the self-review process.</li>
</ul><h3>Nelson Playcentre Association</h3><p>The playcentres, with support from the association are increasing their interest in te reo and tikanga Māori, and getting to know Māori parents and their aspirations better. The re-establishment of Te Rōpū, a special group for Māori parents, is beginning to grow Māori parents’ confidence and pride in being Māori.</p><p>Playcentre environments are inviting, attractively presented, well resourced and spacious. Good use is made of self review to ensure the wide range of equipment and resources are regularly updated and build children’s creativity, confidence and resourcefulness. Centres often have a strong focus on literacy, mathematics and science.</p><p>Families are valued and provided with considerable support in their parenting role. Parent-education courses are held during playcentre sessions and the majority of parents attend. A high percentage of parents are progressing quickly through the education courses.</p><p>Children and parents are well supported by experienced and long-serving supervision team members, who have also been or still are playcentre parents. Supervision team members provide considerable support to parents to understand and put into practice:</p><ul>
<li>the playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>cooperative ways of working and sharing responsibilities</li>
<li>the best ways to promote the learning and development of infants, toddlers and children.</li>
</ul><p>Individual centres are well supported by the association executive and the liaison officers who have a good knowledge of children’s wellbeing and learning, and playcentre operation. They are committed to making playcentres work well for families.</p><p>The association and centres have a good range of policies and procedures to guide the day-to-day operation of individual playcentres. The liaison officers use their extensive knowledge of playcentre to ensure the centres provide high standards of health and safety, are well maintained and activities are well presented and interesting for children.</p><p>There continues to be significant change occurring in the structure of governance and management at association and federation levels.</p><h3>Key Next Steps for the association</h3><p>The association executive and ERO agree that the key next steps for the association to continue to provide positive outcomes for all children include:</p><ul>
<li>sustaining and strengthening of Māori perspectives in the curriculum and supporting Māori children to experience success as Māori</li>
<li>developing ways to ensure that children of Pacific heritage and other cultures maintain connections to their cultural identity and language</li>
<li>establishing an ongoing, well understood self-review process that monitors progress in achieving the strategic goals and improving learning and teaching</li>
<li>reviewing and strengthening the appraisal process for liaison officers and supervisors to ensure all children experience high-quality learning.</li>
<li>establishing strategic direction for the organisation that clearly shows the association's priorities for its long-term development and sustainability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mapua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b> </b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mapua Playcentre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>11 May 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
