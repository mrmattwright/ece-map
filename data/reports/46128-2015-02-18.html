</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blue School is a privately owned, full day early childhood service situated in Greytown. It opened just over eighteen months ago and is licensed for 30 children over two-years-old. Children attending are aged between three to six years.</p><p>The preschool‚Äôs educational approach gives focus to ‚Äòleading each child on a daily journey of discovery, where they are excited, stimulated and learn naturally. Inquiry-based learning underpins the teaching'.</p><p>Emphasis is given to developing children‚Äôs skills related to the four Cs: collaboration, communication, creativity and confidence. This approach is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Blue School has experienced a few staff changes since it opened. Staffing at the time of this ERO review consists of a manager, three teachers and one trainee teacher. Two teachers are provisionally registered and one is fully registered.</p><p>This is Blue School‚Äôs first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic learners. They are inquisitive and like to ask questions, find out and problem solve. They interact well with their teachers and each other. Children are developing as independent, confident and competent learners.</p><p>The programme is child led and provides sufficient challenge. It is guided by children‚Äôs questions, talents, interests and needs, as well as family aspirations and goals. Children are exposed to a wide range of learning opportunities through discovery, free play and a project-based approach. Key emphasis is given to literacy, mathematics, science, the arts, movement and other languages.</p><p>The environment is stimulating, spacious and well planned. Resources, equipment and wall displays are attractively presented and invite interest. Children move easily between the inside and outdoor areas. They willingly engage in activities and enjoy pursuing a project. A challenge is seeking ways for children to use the environment to discover and inquire without the interruptions of the timetable.</p><p>Teachers are actively encouraged to use ‚Äòclever questioning‚Äô to extend children‚Äôs thinking. While they are at various stages of developing this skill, ERO observed some very good examples of this happening. Such questions inspire children to explore and continually gain new knowledge about the world around them.</p><p>Each child has a useful working plan to guide teaching and learning. Teachers observe their interests, record their questions and reflect on how they can support individual development. Processes for assessing, planning and evaluating the programme continue to be reviewed and improved.</p><p>Some very good learning stories are being developed to capture children‚Äôs rich learning experiences. These are shared with families, include next development steps and invite parents‚Äô and whƒÅnau responses. Information about te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is included in these stories.</p><p>A welcoming atmosphere and sense of belonging are apparent. Parents are kept well informed. They engage informally and formally with teachers through two-way goal setting meetings twice a year. Information about their child‚Äôs learning is regularly shared during daily conversations, through learning stories and digital media.</p><p>Transition into Blue School and on to school is well planned. A comprehensive induction package enables two-way communication between teachers and families. The manager liaises with the local school to ensure children are well prepared, and provides good guidance for families.</p><p>The manager is strongly committed to the Blue School philosophy and educational approach. She is an enthusiastic leader who guides teachers to develop practices that are in line with the preschool‚Äôs vision, mission and beliefs. She has a positive relationship with local iwi to promote success for MƒÅori children. The manager has worked hard to establish the Blue School and is well supported by the owner.</p><p>Considerable work has been done to develop a good framework to sustain, embed and improve performance. A range of policies and procedures, together with long and short-term plans, guide the management of the curriculum and children‚Äôs wellbeing.</p><p>A good staff appraisal process is developed and is at the early stage of implementation. Including centre-wide goals would assist closer alignment between the vision, goals and professional development. Self review is well understood and implemented to promote improvement and enhance outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teachers have identified a number of next steps to continue the development of Blue School in line with its vision and goals. ERO supports this forward planning and suggests giving priority to:</p><ul>
<li>further development of the Blue School‚Äôs curriculum, based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, to promote shared understandings about the inquiry approach and ‚Äòclever questioning‚Äô</li>
<li>curriculum leadership</li>
<li>providing clear expectations and strengthening strategic and annual planning so progress can be monitored against expected outcomes</li>
<li>ensuring all staff are appraised each year.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blue School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blue School will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central Select Region</p><p>18 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
