<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Parnell Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report noted that children were confident learners in a high quality programme. Teachers were keen to strengthen their bicultural practices and response to the aspirations that M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau have for their children. The kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports and the teaching team has remained the same since the 2009 ERO review.</p><p>Since 2009 teachers have maintained good practices and engaged in professional development to enhance teaching practices and further enrich the programme. They are reflective and use self review to inform developments. There have been improvements to the environment and an increase in information and communication technologies (ICT) available for children.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association provides effective operational and management structures for the kindergarten. Association personnel provide ongoing support and professional guidance for teachers. An administrator and a teacher aide also assist the three qualified teachers.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have respectful and trusting relationships with kindergarten families and well established connections with the local community. They work collaboratively to support children&rsquo;s learning and development. There is a high level of support and appreciation from parents for the teachers and the service they provide. Teachers welcome wh&#257;nau involvement in their children&rsquo;s education, keep them fully informed, and encourage them to share their strengths and ideas. Teachers have developed good processes to identify and respond the aspirations of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. The cultural backgrounds of all families are valued and their knowledge affirmed. There is a strong sense of partnership in the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers view all children as competent learners. They provide a high quality, inclusive programme that is strongly reflective of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. The kindergarten prioritises meaningful, relevant learning experiences and values te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Attractively presented assessment and planning documentation shows how children&rsquo;s group and individual interests guide the programme. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are highly valued, added to by parents, and reflect children's strengths and cultural backgrounds. Teachers could consider increasing the visibility of child and teacher evaluation in portfolios and other programme documentation.</p><p>Children learn in a stimulating and richly resourced learning environment that invites and supports their sustained engagement in play. They are able to be creative and expressive through an extensive variety of art, dance, and music activities. Children&rsquo;s independent use of ICT, in many ways, is a strength. Teachers&rsquo; skilful interactions assist children to explore ways to apply literacy, numeracy and science concepts for authentic purposes. Children are developing a respect for the natural world and an understanding of environmentally sustainable practices. They have very good opportunities to explore and be physically active in the naturally landscaped outdoor area. Children play cooperatively, share ideas and are developing an appreciation of other points of view. They have fun and are confident, eager learners.</p><p>The Kindergarten Association supports teachers&rsquo; professional development effectively. As well as Association-wide professional development, teachers are able to select individual professional development that adds to their confidence about their work. Teachers have made good use of these professional learning opportunities. The positive impact of this learning can be seen in the emphasis given to embedding bicultural practices and enhancing children&rsquo;s social competence.</p><p>Self review is child focused, purposeful and meaningful and has been used well to inform improvements. Teachers reflect on how their practice and the programme promote positive outcomes for all children. Their teaching philosophy is regularly reviewed and evident in their practice. Clear strategic goals, which closely link to those of the Association, are clearly outlined in annual plans. Teachers agree that they could increase the depth of, and include more perspectives in, their self review processes.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Parnell Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>7 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
