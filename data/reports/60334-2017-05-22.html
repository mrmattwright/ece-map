</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Arawhata Road is situated in Paraparaumu. It provides education and care for children from two to five years of age, five days a week. Nine of the children enrolled identify as MƒÅori and six as Pacific.</p><p>Since the March 2014 ERO evaluation, a new centre manager and a new teaching team have been appointed. All teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports the teaching team.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included strengthening self review and implementing different ways to engage children in choosing their own direction in learning.¬† Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>ABC Arawhata is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews involving the BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is evident in practice. Children are well supported on their 'ladder of life‚Äëlong learning'. Those with additional learning needs receive quality assistance. External agencies are involved when required.</p><p>Teachers and children have fun as part of the learning processes. Calm and positive interactions and sustained group and individual play are evident. Literacy, mathematics and science is woven meaningfully into a play-based programme.</p><p>Diverse cultures are strongly represented and celebrated in the environment and the programme. Children‚Äôs culture, language and identity are highly valued and promoted.¬†</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is actively promoted and evident in the centre. Children have opportunities to celebrate and share their whakapapa with their peers. Aspects of te reo MƒÅori are used in general conversations with children. They have regular opportunities to engage with older learners at a local school by participating in the school's kapa haka programme. Enriching the bicultural programme through more consistent use of te reo MƒÅori in everyday practice is a next step.</p><p>Building strong relationships with whƒÅnau, parents and families is an ongoing focus. Specific professional learning and development has supported leaders and teachers to develop their understanding of what educational success looks like for MƒÅori and Pacific children. Developing targeted learning partnerships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and the Pacific community is a key next step. This should assist the centre to determine what success looks like in this local context.</p><p>A useful programme-planning framework has recently been implemented. All children's needs are planned for individually. Teachers notice children‚Äôs learning and interests, and plan enrichment using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They share ideas and useful teaching strategies.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolio's show their interests, friendships and participation in the programme.¬† The use of an on-line assessment tool for recording and sharing children‚Äôs learning promotes closer links between home and centre.</p><p>Leaders agree that the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle should be enhanced with clearer links between planning and assessment. The centre should consider ways to include:</p><ul>
<li>parents and children in all aspects of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle</li>
<li>clearer links between learning, progress and intentional teaching strategies</li>
<li>children‚Äôs culture, language and identity made more visible within their planned learning journey.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have recently implemented a new internal evaluation framework. They work alongside the centre manager and teaching team to build their evaluative understanding and capability. This has the potential to improve teachers' practice by enabling them to evaluate the impact of their approach and programme on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>There is a well-considered approach transitioning children into the centre. Leaders and teachers actively support children‚Äôs successful move to school. A range of useful strategies are employed to engage parents in all aspects of transition.</p><p>Professional service managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. This clearly identifies strengths and areas for development. Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A comprehensive policy framework, including procedures and systems, guides the operation of the centre.</p><p>A collaborative leadership approach is actively promoted in the centre. The teaching team is well supported to undertake challenges and continuously improve its practice.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment and has a developmental focus. Formal observations of practice are providing useful information about the quality of teaching.</p><p>Teachers and leaders are building their capabilities through an inquiry and knowledge-building framework to help improve positive outcomes for children. BestStart provides opportunities to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>encourage teachers to consistently use te reo MƒÅori in their practice</li>
<li>develop learning partnerships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and the Pacific community</li>
<li>enhance aspects of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Arawhata Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Arawhata Road will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>22 May 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
