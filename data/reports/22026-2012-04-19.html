<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Morningside Playcentre in urban Auckland is a well established centre, where parents and wh&#257;nau work cooperatively to run five sessions per week for their children. The Auckland Playcentres Association provides support personnel and a framework for centre management. A strong family focus and very good support for new members have resulted in close relationships amongst families. Children and their wh&#257;nau enjoy the centre&rsquo;s environment, which is well resourced to support learning.</p><p align="left">Previous ERO reports have identified many areas of good performance in the centre and these remain evident. Centre members have established a culture of reflective and collaborative practice and implement high quality management processes. A relevant and practical strategic plan reflects Playcentre philosophy and the centre&rsquo;s vision, and informs annual and action plans. Purposeful self review is a noteworthy feature in all areas of centre operations.</p><p align="left">Centre members have good levels of Playcentre qualifications and have participated in an external professional development programme focused on literacy in early childhood. They have a heightened awareness of children&rsquo;s learning processes and have strengthened both the quality of their support for, and their documentation of, children&rsquo;s learning. Children&rsquo;s assessment records are insightful and are now being used to provide very good information for children as they transition to school.</p><p align="left">Children have established friendships, play cooperatively, and make independent choices about their activities. They are confident that adults will support and respond to their ideas. Imaginative play and creative storytelling are features of children&rsquo;s play. Centre members actively engage with children in their play and some more experienced members model effective strategies to promote communication, thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Areas that centre members consider that they could strengthen include the extent to which programmes reflect Playcentre&rsquo;s commitment to bicultural practices and the diverse cultures of the centre&rsquo;s community. Centre members continue to review the layout of resources to best respond to children&rsquo;s current interests and preferences. Ongoing reflection about ways of supporting children to develop more self-directed and complex play would be worthwhile.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the members of Morningside Playcentre were invited to consider their priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Morningside Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 17 families who currently have children enrolled provide four mixed-age sessions per week, and one for children over the age of three years. The centre also provides a weekly SPACE programme for first-time parents in the community.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 report commented on a high number of positive aspects of centre operations. Centre members have taken a variety of positive steps to respond to these recommendations and to strengthen curriculum delivery.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><em>Relationships.</em> There is a settled, unhurried atmosphere in the centre as parents and wh&#257;nau work together to provide programmes for their children. Children know each other well and some families have developed strong friendships. New parents and wh&#257;nau are well supported to join the group and to become involved in play programmes and centre management. Children and their wh&#257;nau demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing in the centre.</p><p align="left"><em>Physical environment.</em> Children choose from a variety of good quality resources to initiate play ideas and develop their activities. They move freely between the indoors and the outside covered deck and play areas. A designated space provides a quiet area for infants when required, and toddlers are able to explore the environment alongside their older peers. Adults frequently adapt the resources and layout in response to children&rsquo;s interests.</p><p align="left"><em>Support for play.</em> Parents and wh&#257;nau provide good levels of support for childinitiated play and offer additional equipment and ideas to extend children&rsquo;s activities. More experienced centre members provide leadership and modelling in their active engagement with children&rsquo;s play. They work hard to promote children&rsquo;s ownership of their learning.</p><p align="left">Children initiate and lead play activities, ask for help when needed and are confident that adults will provide support for their ideas. Some more experienced parents use questions effectively to promote independent thinking and problem solving, and to extend conversations with children. Children have opportunities to experiment with ICT, and literacy and numeracy learning are integrated in their activities. Support for children&rsquo;s language development and creative imaginative play and storytelling are noteworthy features in the centre.</p><p align="left"><em>Planning, assessment and evaluation</em>. Comprehensive assessment information, recorded in a variety of ways, shows responsiveness to individual children and continuity and progression in their learning. It includes children&rsquo;s contributions as well as input from parents and other adults. High quality learning stories show increasing awareness and insightful anaysis by adults about children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left"><em>Adults know the children very well.</em> They reflect on children&rsquo;s learning and possibilities for extension at termly meetings and at the end of each session, and plan accordingly. Information is shared with all parents and wh&#257;nau and across different sessions, to support continuity for children&rsquo;s learning. Recently a new transition booklet has been developed to share rich assessment information with schools when children leave the centre.</p><p align="left"><em>Management and self review.</em> Centre management practices are collaborative, well established and effective. They are supported by high quality documentation. Strategic thinking is evident in processes for strategic planning, which informs detailed and specific annual and action plans. These plans are regularly reviewed and adapted.</p><p align="left">All centre members participate in centre management and self review. They have a diverse range of skills to contribute and are becoming increasingly reflective and purposeful in their review of all aspects of curriculum and management. Centre member&rsquo;s responses to ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review also indicate their enthusiasm for continually improving provision for their children.</p><p align="left"><em>Philosophy in practice.</em> The centre illustrates the Playcentre philosophy in practice. Children and their parents/wh&#257;nau learn together and there is a seamlessness between children&rsquo;s homes and the centre. Centre members have examined the Playcentre philosophy in depth, and identified what they believe about the best environment for children&rsquo;s learning. They have linked these beliefs to their vision for the centre and what they do each day. The centre is in a strong position to continue building leadership capability amongst families and providing very well for children&rsquo;s early education.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Through their self review, and in their strategic plan, centre members have identified areas for further development. These include further developments in the learning environment, developing a focus on sustainability, and increasing the extent to which te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are integrated naturally in programmes. The Association and centre continue to work towards establishing reciprocal relationships with Ng&#257;ti Whatua.</p><p align="left">ERO concurs with the centre&rsquo;s plans for development and also suggests that centre members:</p><ul>
<li>continue to review the layout and presentation of areas of play to better reflect the cultural diversity of the community, to improve children&rsquo;s access to resources and to support the extension of child-directed play</li>
<li>consider displaying and keeping documentation that is more readily available for children to revisit and shows how specific interests or projects evolve over time, how adults support and reflect on this, and how learning outcomes for children are enhanced</li>
<li>continue to reflect on ways to foster children&rsquo;s independence in extending their play ideas and increasing the complexity of their play</li>
<li>as part of formal self review, habitually reflect on how changes impact on children&rsquo;s experiences and learning outcomes.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the members of Morningside Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice the centre members should ensure that they remain vigilant in regard to identifying and removing or minimising hazards in the environment.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre members agree that centre members should, through their well-established reflective practice, continue to consider ways of supporting children to develop more self-directed and complex play that builds on their ideas over time.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5.

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-morningside-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Morningside Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Morningside Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Morningside Playcentre in urban Auckland is a well established centre, where parents and wh&#257;nau work cooperatively to run five sessions per week for their children. The Auckland Playcentres Association provides support personnel and a framework for centre management. A strong family focus and very good support for new members have resulted in close relationships amongst families. Children and their wh&#257;nau enjoy the centre&rsquo;s environment, which is well resourced to support learning.</p><p align="left">Previous ERO reports have identified many areas of good performance in the centre and these remain evident. Centre members have established a culture of reflective and collaborative practice and implement high quality management processes. A relevant and practical strategic plan reflects Playcentre philosophy and the centre&rsquo;s vision, and informs annual and action plans. Purposeful self review is a noteworthy feature in all areas of centre operations.</p><p align="left">Centre members have good levels of Playcentre qualifications and have participated in an external professional development programme focused on literacy in early childhood. They have a heightened awareness of children&rsquo;s learning processes and have strengthened both the quality of their support for, and their documentation of, children&rsquo;s learning. Children&rsquo;s assessment records are insightful and are now being used to provide very good information for children as they transition to school.</p><p align="left">Children have established friendships, play cooperatively, and make independent choices about their activities. They are confident that adults will support and respond to their ideas. Imaginative play and creative storytelling are features of children&rsquo;s play. Centre members actively engage with children in their play and some more experienced members model effective strategies to promote communication, thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Areas that centre members consider that they could strengthen include the extent to which programmes reflect Playcentre&rsquo;s commitment to bicultural practices and the diverse cultures of the centre&rsquo;s community. Centre members continue to review the layout of resources to best respond to children&rsquo;s current interests and preferences. Ongoing reflection about ways of supporting children to develop more self-directed and complex play would be worthwhile.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
