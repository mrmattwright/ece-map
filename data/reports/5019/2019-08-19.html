</table><p>Tikipunga Free Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tikipunga Free Kindergarten provides four and six-hour sessions for up to 40 children over the age of two years. The roll includes 36 percent who identify as MƒÅori, and a small number of Asian and Samoan children.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy values te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, ako (community of learners), ngƒÅ hononga (relationships), and te taiao (environment). The teaching team includes a head teacher, three other registered teachers, an administrator, and a qualified lunch cover staff member.</p><p>The kindergarten has had a number of leadership changes. The team has been increased by an additional teacher to recognise the need for lunch cover, and to support younger children attending. Teachers share the kindergarten leadership.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted next steps for building on existing good practices. Areas for development included philosophy review, internal evaluation and connections with local schools. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten. They take opportunities to explore the environment and develop friendships with other children. They work collaboratively, following their interests and making decisions about their play. Some children engage independently in sustained periods of focused work.</p><p>The positive relationships teachers have formed with whƒÅnau enable some sharing about children's cultures and the contexts of their home lives. Teachers are working to increase the sense of ownership and belonging whƒÅnau have in the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers are kind, patient and inclusive of children and their needs. They provide a range of good quality resources and experiences to encourage play. They work effectively with children with additional needs, supporting their integration into the kindergarten. Teachers focus on supporting children's wellbeing and social competence.</p><p>The kindergarten has been included in a pilot programme of KidsCan in Early Childhood Education supplying essential resources for children's wellbeing. Effective use of Government equity funding contributes to good provision for children with additional learning needs.</p><p>WhƒÅnau aspirations for their children are becoming more clearly visible in children's portfolios. Some recent portfolio records include information about individual children and their learning. This is a positive step in strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Children's understanding and use of te reo MƒÅori has been improved through the input of an experienced MƒÅori kuia rongonui who has worked extensively with teachers. The evidence of her support is apparent in displays and portfolios, and in teachers' use of kupu MƒÅori in conversations with children. Teachers provide ongoing support for MƒÅori children to be confident in their language, culture and identity.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken much work to improve the outdoor area to facilitate children's risk-taking and physical agility. They are considering ways of making the indoor playroom and deck space more inviting for children. The introduction of rituals for morning mat times and snack times are helping to engage children's interest.</p><p>Transitions into the kindergarten and to school are well managed. Links with children's siblings and wider whƒÅnau are strong and contribute to useful connections with the adjoining primary school. They support children's sense of place and wellbeing.</p><p>Professional practice managers (PPM) regularly visit kindergartens to provide leadership and curriculum guidance for teachers. A Pou Whakarewa Tikanga MƒÅori Advisor works closely with teachers to increase their understanding of and focus on authentically threading te ao MƒÅori into learning programmes. There is an organisation-wide emphasis on providing high quality resources and equipment for children. Leaders and teachers value and respect the thoughtful use of natural resources.</p><p>The Association provides a comprehensive policy and procedure framework that sets clear expectations and guides teachers‚Äô practice. It has developed relevant appraisal and teacher inquiry processes that reflect the Teaching Council‚Äôs guidelines. Each kindergarten‚Äôs annual plan aligns to the Association‚Äôs strategic vision, values and goals. NKA employs a speech language therapist and seconds a social worker from Family Works to provide targeted support for children, whƒÅnau and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish an agreed team culture by developing a shared philosophy, in partnership with whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage children in more frequent, meaningful conversations that deepen their understandings about teaching and learning, and inspire the exploration of new ideas and thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revise assessment, planning and evaluation processes to focus on recording outcomes for individual children and the effectiveness of teaching practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Association-wide development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening understanding of evaluative thinking and internal evaluation processes to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the Association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tikipunga Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
