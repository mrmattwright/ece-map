<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1&nbsp;<span>Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waikouaiti Playcentre is making good progress in developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waikouaiti Playcentre is one of 37 playcentres administered by the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). It is located across the road from another local early childhood centre and the local school. Many of the children attend both early childhood services.</p><p>At the time of this review the playcentre opens one morning session a week for children from birth to five years. Children attend in good numbers with some new enrolments in recent times. Many of the families are farmers or work at the local mine. Most of the parents are new to the playcentre.</p><p>The qualified educator resigned at the end of Term 3, 2012. Since then the parent council has worked hard to meet the necessary requirements to ensure the playcentre continues to operate. The parents now have increased confidence and energy in their role as first educators.</p><p>Since the start of Term 4 an OPA advisor has led the weekly session. The centre has steps in place so that it will be responsible for leading its own sessions in 2013. By then, two parents should have completed the necessary playcentre training.</p><p>The playcentre has an attractive and well-maintained outdoor area. The parent council has plans to further improve and modernise the inside areas. The playcentre has a long history in the community and receives very good local support, especially when fundraising.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in fifteen early childhood education services within the OPA umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents are made to feel very welcome and relaxed in the centre. Children benefit from their parents staying with them. Parents are positive, supportive and have fun with and alongside their children. Parents have purposeful conversations to help children develop thinking skills and extend their learning as they play.</p><p>Children experience a wide range of activities within the centre. Their interests are followed up on and resources support their learning. Parents initiate activities to stimulate children&rsquo;s learning, such as making boats and experimenting with concepts of floating and sinking.</p><p>Children are involved in the day-to-day work of the centre, which includes gardening and planting. They learn to use real equipment. At the carpentry area they use saws and experiment with Oamaru stone. Children also enjoy group baking sessions and exploring their local community.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are well catered and provided for. There is a separate sleep room and a designated baby area with a comfortable couch and suitable resources. Toddlers have many opportunities for sensory play and exploration.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy was reviewed in 2011. It is a useful document to guide the learning that is valued in the centre. The parent council has made a good start to developing a system to plan for children&rsquo;s learning. The system includes identifying children&rsquo;s next learning steps. The next step is for the parents to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to use and further develop this system to show children&rsquo;s learning over time</li>
<li>help new parents know how to identify, plan for and support children in their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Self review is underway and has helped the parents to make some useful improvements, such as the way M&#257;ori perspectives are integrated into the programme. Self review has also helped the parents to identify priorities for further development in the operation of the centre. The next step is for the parents to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop their understanding of self review</li>
<li>continue to implement self review in manageable and useful ways.</li>
</ul><p>Since the start of Term 4 2012, all the office bearer roles have been filled. The current group of parents are motivated and enthusiastic. This momentum needs to be maintained in order for the centre to continue its good progress.</p><p>The centre advisor provides valued support to the centre.</p><h3>Governance and Management</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) provides a comprehensive range of support to this and other playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing an action plan for all centres to be relicensed with the 2008 Regulations</li>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing support for employment processes</li>
<li>targeted support for playcentres requiring additional assistance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>The OPA executive and personnel hold regular meetings with a specific focus on each centre. They discuss best ways to support individual centres. Records from these meetings could be more specific about what support is provided and the difference it has made.</p><p>A strength of the OPA is the ongoing support provided by the centre advisors. The centre advisor effectively supports the parents and educators in developing their understanding of planning and assessment and self review.</p><p>Centre advisors should continue to build their knowledge and understanding of self review. They should use each centre's self review as evidence to assure the governors of the OPA how well the playcentre is promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>OPA personnel need to further develop their understanding of self review and use the findings of self review to assure themselves of the effectiveness of their strategic goals and all aspects of the OPA management and operations.</p><p>The OPA governors have a sound policy framework to support the playcentre.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikouaiti Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>21 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
