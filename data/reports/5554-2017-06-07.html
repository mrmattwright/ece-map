</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oranga Kindergarten is licensed to provide care and education for up to 40 children aged over two years. Families have the option of enrolling their children for morning sessions or for a full kindergarten day that is similar to school hours. Children who attend come from a wide range cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Four qualified teachers are led by a newly appointed head teacher, and are supported by a teaching assistant and a teacher aide.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy promotes relationships. The teaching team is committed to providing a welcoming culture, inclusive of all children and families, from the richly diverse community. Teachers actively promote the bicultural nature of Aotearoa, through the learning programme and kindergarten operations.</p><p>The very positive 2014 ERO report identified several areas of good practice, including the confident, settled children and strong partnerships between teachers and families. Teachers were seen to be skilfully guiding children's learning and working as a collaborative team.</p><p>Areas identified in the 2014 report for continued refinement were self-review and teachers' bicultural development. There has been some good progress in these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides a governance and management framework, and support personnel in a range of different roles.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play together in social groups. They enjoy opportunities for imaginative play and play co-operatively together for good periods of time. Friendships amongst children are evident.</p><p>Children enjoy being creative and playing in the expansive outdoor area. Teachers play alongside children and take advantage of some opportunities to promote further learning. The programme provides numerous opportunities for children to go on excursions into the local community and to visit places of interest.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO appreciated the way they had been warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. Teachers work well with individual children and their families to help them settle into the programme.</p><p>Teachers' commitment to promoting bi-cultural practices in the programme and in centre operations is highly visible. The language, culture and identities of children are celebrated. The indoor environment has been the subject of recent review and areas of play have been newly established.</p><p>Teachers regularly identify groups of children for more in depth assessment. They work together to produce information for parents of these children, showing their child's learning and development over time. Learning stories record children's participation in the programme and are linked to the six key areas of learning, established in consultation with whānau.</p><p>The head teacher has begun to document guidelines for programme planning. With the teaching team now established, teachers will need time to work together and develop shared understandings of how they can utilise their skills to ensure quality practices are implemented. To support the head teacher in her new role, an action plan has been developed.</p><p>An effective system for conducting internal evaluation is followed by staff. This could be strengthened by focussing more on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Kindergarten operations are guided by a comprehensive strategic plan and a shared vision, linked to the AKA’s strategic goals. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) also aligns with AKA and kindergarten strategic plans. It enables the AKA and teachers to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement. The AKA continues to review its management and leadership structure. It has begun a process of internal evaluation to establish how effectively the four pillars of its strategic plan are resulting in more positive outcomes for children, their families, and the organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers agree that, to enhance their provision for children's learning, they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and refine a system of documenting programme planning and evaluation, based on teachers' identification of children's interests and strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use effective questioning that encourages more complex thinking in children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider how effectively the layout and resourcing of the kindergarten supports children to become engaged in, and sustain their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build deeper understandings of the purpose of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oranga Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Oranga Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>7 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
