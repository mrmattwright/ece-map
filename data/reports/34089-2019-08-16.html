</table><p>Pukekos Educare Thames¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukekos Educare Thames is situated south of Thames. The centre provides all-day education and care in a mixed age setting for children to school age. The centre is licensed for 44 children including 10 up to the age of two years. The current roll is 48 children of whom eight identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Pukekos Educare Limited sold two of their three centres in 2018. Pukekos Educare Thames is now a stand-alone service. There has been significant changes to personnel roles and responsibilities in 2018.</p><p>At Pukekos, teachers advocate everyone‚Äôs right to a place to be me, to nurture knowledge, skills and attitudes for life and about life. Aspirations and diversity are embraced and celebrated, collaboration and co -operation is the cherished approach to centre life, in a holistic environment that is natural, stimulating and engaging.</p><p>Management have responded well to the key next steps identified in the 2014 ERO review related to self review, transitions to school and centre routines.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy, vision, and mission statement are clearly evident in the life of the centre. Clear policies and procedures, alongside regular and systematic self review lead to centre wide improvement. Expectations for high-quality teaching practice has been collaboratively developed by leaders and teachers. There is now a need to consolidate the new teaching team to consistently implement centre expectations. Management actively promotes positive and equitable outcomes for all children.</p><p>Centre leadership is focused on building teachers' confidence and capability. Shared roles and responsibilities are providing emergent leadership opportunities for teachers. There is a high level of relational trust and collaborative ways of working are fostered. Responsive and respectful relationships with parents and whƒÅnau support children‚Äôs sense of belonging.</p><p>A wide range of experiences provide rich programmes for learning. A team approach to planning is informed by child voice and the emergent curriculum. There is a focus on the natural world and kaitiakitanga. Literacy, mathematics, oral language and science are seamlessly integrated into all areas of the curriculum. The environment promotes risk taking, creativity, and problem solving. The bicultural curriculum is visible throughout the centre environment and in assessment and planning. Children are actively encouraged to make their own choices.</p><p>Teaching practices promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers respect and value children's ideas and decisions through sensitive and responsive interactions. They promote a calm and unhurried approach to learning through play. There is a balance of child-initiated and teacher-led activities with multiple opportunities for independent, group and sustained play. Teachers engage children in learning conversations and use open-ended questioning to extend children‚Äôs thinking. Children are empowered to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves, others and the group.</p><p>Children up the age of two years are nurtured in a calm, responsive environment. Relationships between families and teachers supports infants' natural rhythms and routines.</p><p>There are effective transition processes into, through and out of the centre. An inclusive approach supports children with additional needs and their whƒÅnau well. Teachers know and respond to specific learning and behaviour needs and plans and strategies are developed alongside parents and external agencies.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the next key steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the use of te reo MƒÅori throughout daily interactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of curriculum focus areas for ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers use and understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukekos Educare Thames completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>16 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
