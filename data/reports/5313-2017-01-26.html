</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Carterton Kindergarten is located in central Carterton. It is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. This is the first review for this kindergarten since the merger.</p><p>Since the July 2013 ERO report, the service has introduced daily six hour sessions and continue to provide mixed age groups. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children aged over two years. Of the 46 children enrolled, eight are MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy highlights children as confident, competent, lifelong learners, strong in the knowledge of their own family culture and the culture of Aotearoa New Zealand. There is a focus on children's experiences being grounded in an innovative well-resourced learning environment, which inspires new ideas, risk taking and empowerment.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the Wellington association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery, including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning. Its introduction in former Rimutaka Kindergartens occurred during 2015, with kindergartens adapting it to respond to their community. Carterton Kindergarten is making good progress with understanding and implementing Te Manawa.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report for Carterton Kindergarten identified that teachers needed to continue building evaluative capacity to systematically inquire into and judge the effectiveness of their teaching practice and ongoing review. Including value statements in assessment, planning practices and learning stories, and further developing strategies and opportunities for Pacific children to experience success as Pacific were also recommended. There has been significant progress in responding to these identified next steps. Areas of good practice from the previous ERO report have been sustained. Teachers have been proactively leading community learning groups.</p><p>All six teachers at the kindergarten are qualified, five are fully registered and one teacher is completing registration.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are engaged learners. They are decision makers who demonstrate a strong sense of place and belonging.</p><p>A richly resourced, developing environment invites children's curiosity and offers challenge through physical discovery and problem solving. Children are competent, capable learners. Their direction guides the programme and teachers make adjustments according to their focus.</p><p>Strong relationships between teachers, children, parents and whƒÅnau support engagement in learning. Parents and whƒÅnau have many opportunities to contribute to their child's learning. Educators are responsive to parent aspirations.</p><p>Teachers actively encourage children's thinking. Mathematics and literacy learning are included in the programme through conversation and the range of play experiences, physical and creative activities.</p><p>Planning for learning occurs in multiple ways for individuals, and groups of children. The team has considered ways to enhance this through the contribution of children. Staff meetings and ongoing discussions occur to build shared knowledge and consistency of teaching and learning practices. Teachers reflect on what makes the most difference for children and their learning. Te Manawa has helped teachers to consider how to enhance continuity in children's learning over time. Leadership is distributed across the teaching team.</p><p>The kindergarten tone and environment supports MƒÅori children's success. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are integral to the programme. Staff give priority to including authentic te ao MƒÅori experiences for children. MƒÅori children stand confidently, proudly sharing pepeha.</p><p>Respectful engagement with parents, whƒÅnau and the wider community is upheld. Parent and whƒÅnau feedback affirms the kindergarten's responsiveness to MƒÅori ways of knowing, doing and being. Portfolios highlight children's culture, language and identity. Te ao MƒÅori is reflected, with links to te reo MƒÅori and iwi highlighted.</p><p>Internal evaluation has resulted in positive change for Pacific children. Teachers identify a need to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of Pacific cultures.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers work in partnership with families and external agencies to support individual learning needs. A flexible, innovative approach includes sharing resources from the centre to the home. The warm, inclusive environment is affirming of the range of children's cultures.¬†</p><p>Well-considered transition processes into the kindergarten and on to local schools are in place. As part of the Carterton Early Childhood Network, staff liaise with new entrant teachers.</p><p>Teachers implement emergent, planned and strategic review, using a range of tools to inquire into curriculum effectiveness. Evaluation is leading to positive changes for children. Strengthening internal evaluation is key priority. The head teacher encourages and supports teachers to improve their knowledge, understanding and implementation of internal evaluation.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback in relation to centre priorities and the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher and leader performance.</p><p>The previous report identified that the association needed to improve appraisal processes. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff are focused on sustaining and improving teaching and learning by continuing to build on and extend self-review and internal evaluation practice.</p><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Carterton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Carterton Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>26 January 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
