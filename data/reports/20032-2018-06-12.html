</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>UNITEC Early Learning Centre is a community based centre located on the UNITEC Mt Albert campus. The two separate licences for Whare Pukeko and Whare Tui, were merged into one licence in January 2014. The centre is now licensed for 103 children, including 24 children up to 2 years of age.</p><p>An executive committee has a governance role for the centre. A centre manager, appointed in 2017, has oversight of day-to-day operations and the curriculum. Leaders in Whare Pukeko, Tui Iti and Tui Nui rooms each work with teams of six to nine qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy values 'playfulness, courage and resilience, nurturing a love of nature, relationships with families and community'. The majority of children attending are Chinese or PƒÅkehƒÅ, with smaller numbers of MƒÅori and Pacific, and children of other ethnicities. The staff come from diverse backgrounds, reflecting the centre's community.</p><p>ERO's 2014 and 2015 reviews of the centres suggested improvements in the areas of internal evaluation, child-led learning, planning and assessment, te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori, and the appraisal process. The centre has progressed significantly in developing bicultural practices and appraisals, and also continues to make progress in other areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be happy and settled in the centre. Teachers know children well and interact with them in attentive and responsive ways. They encourage children to be self-managing and independent. Warm, nurturing and caring relationships with children are evident.</p><p>Children access well-resourced environments with clearly defined areas of play. They are able to make choices and some decisions about their play and learning. Transitions within the centre and on to school have been reviewed by the teaching team. Thoughtful practices are helping to ensure continuity of learning for children as they transition to school.</p><p>Teachers' professional learning and a recent review of bicultural practices, have led to a shared understanding of te ao MƒÅori, and the importance of promoting te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. The centre has worked with the local marae and consulted with local kaumƒÅtua. Continuing support for teachers to integrate te reo MƒÅori into the programme will help support MƒÅori children in their language and identity as MƒÅori in the centre. Leaders express their commitment to weaving manaakitanga into centre practices and assessments of children's learning.</p><p>Teachers foster children's friendships, and create an atmosphere that invites children to work in small groups. Children demonstrate a good sense of belonging. They participate in tuakana/teina interactions, which are valued. In Tui Iti, teachers are skilful at ensuring that children have time and space to play and learn with and alongside each other.</p><p>Portfolios are an attractive record of children's participation in the programme. Assessments demonstrate teachers' knowledge of individual children and their progress over time. Some of these assessments identify children's preferred ways of learning (schemas and dispositions). The team should consider ways to achieve greater consistency in implementing this good practice.</p><p>Teachers skilfully recognise the learning happening for individuals and groups of children. They could include their intentional responses to this learning in programme planning and evaluation. It would be worthwhile for teachers to increase the extent to which they evaluate the effectiveness of their own teaching strategies and their impact on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre has a well-developed sense of community. The team liaises with the wider UNITEC community. Parents participate in, and occasionally lead centre events and celebrations. This involvement is indicative of the robust partnerships that the centre has formed with its community.</p><p>The centre manager aims to develop staff leadership capacity. The team has embarked on a journey to investigate the implications for their practice and documentation, of the revised early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. It is timely for the new manager and teaching teams to review the service's philosophy statement and the extent to which it guides teachers' practice. It would also be appropriate to include explicit reference to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and also to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>Strategic planning and philosophy review are areas of ongoing focus for the team. The executive committee has helped draft the current strategic plan, which includes clearly planned outcomes. Centre managers have identified the need for professional learning to help differentiate annual and strategic planning. Regular policy reviews and good systems at the centre contribute towards sustaining day to day operations and the stability of the teaching team. Regular internal evaluation includes teacher reflections and the use of evidence. The recently improved appraisal process aligns with the Education Council teaching standards. 'Teaching as inquiry' is an integral aspect of these appraisals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Developing a collaborative culture for Whare Pukeko and Whare Tui is a strategic emphasis for centre leaders. Key next steps to support ongoing centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen team understanding and use of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em> to enhance assessment and planning</li>
<li>continuing to develop teaching practices that challenge children's thinking, and support them to lead their learning</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of strategic plans and developments on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of UNITEC Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of UNITEC Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>12 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
