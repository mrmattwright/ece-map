<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Campbell Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>A recent positive association initiative is Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high-quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p>Campbell Kindergarten provides sessional education and care for up to thirty children for five mornings and for up to another thirty children three afternoons per week.</p><p>The values and beliefs expressed in the kindergarten philosophy are well reflected in practice. Children engage in a programme where play is viewed as meaningful learning.</p><p>Teachers present a welcoming and stimulating environment where children are listened to and respected. They use a range of effective strategies to engage children in sustained conversations and further their play. A commitment to the development of a bicultural approach in the programme is strong.</p><p>The teaching team is well led by the head teacher. Collaborative discussion and high expectations for success contribute to the development of good teamwork. Children&rsquo;s and families&rsquo; strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten is evident.</p><p>Teachers and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation identified that priorities for further development are assessment, planning and evaluation practicesand evidence-based self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Campbell Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atCampbell Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
<li>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</li>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>External and internal professional development has been successful in supporting teachers to make significant progress with their knowledge and use of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO review, there have been ongoing improvements to the indoor and outdoor environments.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Programme The values and beliefs expressed in the kindergarten philosophy are well reflected in practice. The programme fosters children&rsquo;s engagement in collaborative and cooperative play. Opportunities for children to further their literacy and science knowledge are successfully integrated throughout the curriculum. Teachers are committed to the meaningful integration of te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori into the programme.</p><p>Routines are well established and provide a framework for the day. Children confidently participate in these. The tone of sessions reflects the purposeful and sustained engagement of children and teachers in shared learning experiences.</p><p>Spontaneous review has been used to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation Planned group experiences provide enrichment to the programme. Children&rsquo;s views are sought and are used to further inform and shape the curriculum offered.</p><p>Profiles are attractive and are readily accessible to children and wh&#257;nau. Learning stories are well used to show children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme and their developing friendships. Teachers use a range of effective strategies to involve children and parents and encourage them to contribute their views to assessment. This strengthens the link between home and the kindergarten. Continuity between stories is shown through teachers identifying children&rsquo;s ongoing learning and developing competence.</p><p>Interactions Teachers are warm, welcoming and respectful of children and adults. They know children well within the context of their family and endeavour to foster relationships through daily interactions and special events.</p><p>A range of effective strategies is used by teachers to engage children in sustained conversations and to further their learning through play. Children&rsquo;s social and emotional competence is fostered through teachers providing specific feedback and setting clear and consistent boundaries.</p><p>Environment Children&rsquo;s exploration and sense of belonging are fostered through the provision of a spacious, well-maintained and aesthetically pleasing learning environment. Easy access to indoor and outdoor spaces, invites exploration and provides an extension to the curriculum. Collaborative and quiet spaces are available for children to use throughout the session.</p><p>A wide range of equipment that offers challenge and complexity to play is accessible to children. Resources and prompts for learning that reflect M&#257;ori language and culture support the integration of a bicultural programme. Resources are also available that reflect the other cultures of children who attend.</p><p>Many opportunities are available for children and wh&#257;nau to revisit and reflect on prior learning experiences. Children&rsquo;s work is valued and thoughtfully displayed. Parents are well supported in their parenting role by teachers and additional useful and easily accessible resources.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation could be further strengthened by teachers through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more frequently showing planned and implemented strategies that extend and challenge children&rsquo;s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making children&rsquo;s learning and progress clear for parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using assessment information more effectively to inform the overall direction of the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening programme evaluation to better support teachers to make judgements about the effectiveness of experiences, and the impact these have on children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teaching strategies that support children to develop their thinking and reasoning abilities should be further strengthened.</p><p>Evidence-based self review has been identified by teachers as requiring further development. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h4><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association has a policy and procedures to ensure all children attending the kindergarten are respected as learners and have equitable access to support and resources for their learning.</p><p>Teachers continue to be well placed to enrol children with special needs as they have in the past. They recognise the importance of having supportive transitions for the child, family and teachers in the service. Transitioning meetings ensure all staff have a shared understanding of the child&rsquo;s needs. They consider any changes to their teaching, or the environment, to ensure the child can fully participate in the programme.</p><p>The kindergarten has a spacious physical environment and a wide range of resources available.

</table><p>19 January 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-campbell-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Campbell Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Campbell Kindergarten.</p><p>Campbell Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>A recent positive association initiative is Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high-quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p>Campbell Kindergarten provides sessional education and care for up to thirty children for five mornings and for up to another thirty children three afternoons per week.</p><p>The values and beliefs expressed in the kindergarten philosophy are well reflected in practice. Children engage in a programme where play is viewed as meaningful learning.</p><p>Teachers present a welcoming and stimulating environment where children are listened to and respected. They use a range of effective strategies to engage children in sustained conversations and further their play. A commitment to the development of a bicultural approach in the programme is strong.</p><p>The teaching team is well led by the head teacher. Collaborative discussion and high expectations for success contribute to the development of good teamwork. Children&rsquo;s and families&rsquo; strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten is evident.</p><p>Teachers and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation identified that priorities for further development are assessment, planning and evaluation practicesand evidence-based self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
