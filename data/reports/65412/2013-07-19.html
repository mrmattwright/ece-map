</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Years Richmond is a community based non-profit service providing education and care for a maximum of 37 children, including seven aged up to two. It has been in operation for 26 years.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board of trustees comprising parents of currently enrolled children. The centre manager is responsible for implementation of annual action plans and the head teacher oversees day-to-day programmes with a particular focus on children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Over 80% of teachers are suitably qualified. Low staff turnover is a feature of the centre and contributes to stability and continuity over time.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by the teaching team’s commitment to ‘trusting, friendly, reciprocal’ relationships with children and their families.</p><p>Recent developments include raising the number of children the service is licensed for and upgrades to indoor and outdoor areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a calm, nurturing and stimulating environment. Warm and positive relationships are evident. Children are confident and enthusiastic learners.</p><p>Indoor spaces are well resourced and thoughtfully laid out. The outdoor area is extensive, offering an inviting variety of opportunities for play, experimentation and investigation. Children enjoy a wide range of physical, creative and exploratory activities.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for in an appropriately equipped area. They move on to the next group when they are two or when teachers and parents judge them to be ready. Four-year-olds have the option of participating in specially designed activities that extend their learning and independence as they move towards transition to school.</p><p>Teachers effectively enact the centre philosophy in their interactions and responsiveness to children. They identify emerging interests and strengths and plan programmes and activities that link with individual and group themes. Profile books are attractive, informative records of children’s learning and development over time.</p><p>The cultural diversity of children and their families is highly valued and celebrated. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are evident in the environment and daily practice. Teachers’ competence and confidence with the bicultural curriculum are areas acknowledged as needing continued support.</p><p>Leaders successfully model and promote a collaborative, reflective culture among staff. The centre manager and head teacher are committed to continuous improvement to enhance outcomes for children. Teachers are appropriately supported by professional development, sourced externally or from colleagues with particular strengths or expertise.</p><p>The board has a strategic approach to governance and planning. Prudent financial management enables trustees to give priority to key areas for development over a three-year period. Their long-term objectives are closely linked to annual plans and managers report progress towards these. Review processes are well understood and embedded.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Processes for planning teaching and learning programmes continue to evolve and improve. Centre managers recognise the need to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>plans clearly and deliberately provide for extending and challenging children’s thinking and skill development</li>
<li>the effectiveness of planned programmes is evaluated in terms of learning outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Leaders fully embrace self review as a means of promoting sustained improvement. They agree with ERO’s finding that the next steps in refining self review are to:</li>
<li>explicitly define what success or effectiveness looks like</li>
<li>assess the quality of initiatives and strategies against these indicators.</li>
</ul><p>Ongoing development of the appraisal system and the bicultural curriculum is likely to be strengthened by implementation of these practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Years Richmond completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Years Richmond will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
