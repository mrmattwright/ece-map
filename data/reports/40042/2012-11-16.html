We work with early childhood services to identify their strengths and the areas they need to review and develop. Early childhood services take part in the review process and are expected to make use of the findings to enhance children's learning and wellbeing.</p><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>BOP Polytechnic ECE Centre 1 is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children due to effective governance, management, leadership, curriculum and teaching.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The BOP Early Childhood Centre 1 is located at the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic Windermere campus in Tauranga. The overall service operates as four areas under two licences on adjacent sites. This ERO report is for Centre 1 which caters for toddlers and children up to three years in two separate areas, Toddler Centre and Preschool Centre. The centre provides all-day education and care for 42 children including 13 children who are identified as being of M&#257;ori descent. It is licensed for 50 children between six months and school age.</p><p>Based within the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic Windermere campus the centre caters for a diverse range of wh&#257;nau. These include staff and students from the Polytechnic and associated networks including School for Young Parents, University of Waikato, and Waiariki Polytechnic. The large number of parents attending different courses requires the centre to be flexible to accommodate a variety of term dates and student attendance hours.</p><p>The centre philosophy centres on providing an educational, nurturing and sustainable learning environment which values bicultural concepts. The centre has a well-qualified, long-serving team of reflective teachers who regularly undertake professional development to enhance their teaching skills. Since the last ERO review in 2009 the service has focused on sustainability, implemented a new teacher appraisal system and continued to develop centre blogs. The healthy eating, baby sign and virtues programmes continue to be implemented effectively across the centre curriculum. Previous ERO reports show that the centre has consistently provided high quality education and care.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre operates within the systems, policies and guidelines of the Polytechnic, and is managed under the umbrella of the School of Design and Humanities. Centre staff and children benefit from the Polytechnic&rsquo;s services and there are strong links with the Teen Parent Unit. Teachers value the aspirations and expectations that parents and wh&#257;nau have for their children.</p><p>The highly experienced team leader is strongly committed to the vision and goals for the service. She is well supported by effective head teachers who promote the service philosophy and provide clear direction for teachers. Aspects of the centre&rsquo;s vision that are highly visible include a holistic sense of whanaungatanga, high adult to child ratios, and eco-friendly practices. Focused, reflective management and leadership are contributing to positive centre development, enhancing learning for teachers and promoting opportunities for children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Highly skilled teachers interact positively and sensitively with children to support and extend their learning. They maintain close communication with parents using a variety of face-to-face, written and electronic media.</p><p>ERO noted other aspects of the centre that are going well. In particular, children benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>inclusive and responsive practices that foster children&rsquo;s confidence to make choices and play and explore with each other</li>
<li>a strong focus on M&#257;ori culture</li>
<li>a well-resourced indoor and outdoor environment</li>
<li>good use of digital and print media to share children&rsquo;s experiences and learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are caring, positive and responsive in their interactions with children, wh&#257;nau and aiga. They support children&rsquo;s sense of belonging in both centres and the wider community, recognising the diversity of families&rsquo; cultures. Teachers focus on developing children&rsquo;s literacy, numeracy and oral language skills. Children confidently share ideas with teachers and each other and seek support as needed. They develop self-help skills, participate in highly developed social play and take on leadership roles.</p><p>Teachers have developed a range of effective self-review processes that are focused on improving teaching practice and outcomes for children. M&#257;ori are recognised as tangata whenua and te ao M&#257;ori is incorporated in centre practices and children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers record and reflect on children&rsquo;s interests and evaluate the quality of their programmes in portfolios, blogs, displays and informal conversations with parents.</p><p>ERO recommends that the centre continues to refine methods of documentation, so that learning pathways for individual children as they develop and progress, the child's voice and children's comments about their learning, are clear for all to see.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have developed a curriculum that is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and learning needs. Teachers align their planning to the principles of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. They emphasise literacy and numeracy and:</p><ul>
<li>plan a responsive programme to extend children&rsquo;s individual interests</li>
<li>observe children to provide opportunities and possibilities in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Children up to the age of two experience a nurturing environment with a high proportion of one-to-one interactions with teachers. Key teachers oversee the care and wellbeing of infants. They maintain close communication with parents and form trusting relationships with the child.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BOP Polytechnic ECE Centre 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>16 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>Review focus</h4><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h4>Disclaimer</h4><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
