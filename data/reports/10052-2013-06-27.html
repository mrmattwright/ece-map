</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kelston Deaf Education Centre Pre-School operates in the grounds of the Kelston Deaf Education Centre (KDEC). It is governed by a combined National Board of Trustees and managed by the KDEC senior management team. The centre provides a mixture of sessional and all day education and care for deaf, hearing impaired, and hearing children from the ages of two to five. The preschool has an increasing number of enrolments from the local community.</p><p>Teachers continue to provide a programme that reflects a commitment to deaf education and the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. As noted in the 2007 and 2010 ERO reports, staff maintain a high level of support for both New Zealand Sign Language and spoken English. Weekly visits to the KDEC Ruamoko marae support children‚Äôs understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Five qualified teachers, two language assistants and one speech language therapist are employed by the centre. Many of the teachers are studying for additional qualifications. In addition, a wide range of professionals come into the centre to support individual children.</p><p>There are plans for major property development for the centre, as part of a rebuild on the KDEC site.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy being actively engaged in play and learning. Their developing confidence, leadership and language skills are nurtured by teachers. Teachers include aspects of literacy, mathematics, science and information communication technologies in children‚Äôs play. Children are encouraged to play cooperatively, join in games and be creative. They are developing a strong sense of themselves as capable learners.</p><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme, guided by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and based on a culture of support and respect for children and their families. There is a very strong focus on bilingual language development (spoken English and NZSL) and on fostering positive relationships. Effective, affirming and inclusive teaching practices respond to the individual needs of children and their families. Children‚Äôs transitions into the centre and to school are very well supported.</p><p>Teachers are developing assessment and planning processes that are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and inform curriculum development. This development is assisted by staff engagement in professional learning and development. Parents are provided with good information about the programme and their child‚Äôs progress and are encouraged to contribute their ideas. Teachers are enthusiastic about enriching the programme and strengthening their use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in everyday practice.</p><p>Effective management practices, including clear responsibilities, policies and procedures, inform and guide daily centre operations. Managers support staff and are committed to maintaining favourable adult to child ratios. The teaching team works collegially, is improvement focused, and benefits from the centre manager‚Äôs strong professional leadership. Self review is well established and is woven into centre processes. The centre philosophy is well understood, provides a good sense of direction and is evident in respectful interactions throughout the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that they could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to extend the scope of self review, ensure that analysis as part of self review is specifically focused, and include families in self-review processes</li>
<li>review how effectively the environment and the centre curriculum reflect and respond to children‚Äôs home languages and cultures</li>
<li>explore further ways to respond to the aspirations of families and the community</li>
<li>increase opportunities for children to take leadership roles in their own learning and in using their cultural strengths.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kelston Deaf Education Centre Pre-School completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kelston Deaf Education Centre Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>27 June 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
