</div><div class="WordSection3">
<p class="ReportText1stPara">KidStart is part of the Barnardos organisation and operates as a national home-based care and learning service.&nbsp; The service operates in the homes of educators for children from birth to five years of age, under the guidance of visiting teachers.&nbsp; The national and regional offices of KidStart provide a framework of systems, policies and guidelines for educators, staff and families using the service.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">KidStart Northcote has ten educators and 35 children.&nbsp; The educational programmes provided for children are guided and supported by regular visits of the visiting teachers who have responsibility for this network.&nbsp; ERO visited five homes as part of this review, reviewed documentation by educators and visiting teachers, and interviewed personnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Since the 2008 ERO review the area manager, KidStart team leader, and visiting teachers have established sound teamwork, better recording systems and greater consistency in educators&rsquo; programmes.&nbsp; These positive changes occurred despite restructuring and financial constraints.&nbsp; The team leader has clearly identified areas in which improvement is still necessary and has tailored professional learning and development for visiting teachers to address these matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Records indicate that children receive good care and education in educators&rsquo; homes.&nbsp; Interactions between children and educators are warm and positive.&nbsp; All educators have resources and equipment to support children&rsquo;s play and learning.&nbsp; KidStart also provides equipment from their toy library so that educators are able to support children&rsquo;s interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children&rsquo;s care and education books indicate that children are provided with a changing range of activities and experiences during each day.&nbsp; Educators attend the KidStart playgroup with their children and ensure that other outings into the community provide opportunities for additional learning.&nbsp; Children appear settled, and show a strong sense of ownership of their playing spaces in educators&rsquo; homes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO will review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of KidStart Northcote was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by KidStart Northcote to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidStart Northcote.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults</li>
<li>the service records of observation, monitoring and quality assurance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The 2008 ERO report noted that educators followed good practices and received regular and useful support from visiting teachers.&nbsp; While there was variability in the quality of assessment and planning documentation, all educators were keeping records about their work with children.&nbsp; ERO noted that parents could be more involved in planning and that there could be more contact between parents and visiting teachers.&nbsp; Progress is being made in addressing these matters.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Outcomes for children.&nbsp; Visiting teachers report that children are secure, settled and trusting in the care of educators.&nbsp; In these home settings children benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>consistently good care and trusting and responsive relationships</li>
<li>activities that reflect their interests</li>
<li>opportunities to make choices about their play</li>
<li>visits to places and groups outside the home to extend their learning and socialisation</li>
<li>clear expectations for their behaviour.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Effective matching ensures that children and their families relate well with their educator and enjoy friendly partnerships and open communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Play environments.&nbsp; Since the 2008 ERO reviews, there has been a significant increase in the quantity and variety of resources that children can use.&nbsp; Educators have built up their own materials and equipment to provide children with choice and interest.&nbsp; On occasions they supplement their provision with resources from the KidStart toy library.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Many educators have designated playroom space that they keep attractively arranged so that resources can be seen by children and are easy for them to access.&nbsp; Educators use indoor as well as outdoor spaces, which are regularly checked both by educators and visiting teachers.&nbsp; Educators often use community facilities and the play and music groups provided by KidStart visiting teachers to extend children&rsquo;s interests and develop their confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Record keeping.&nbsp; Educators follow KidStart expectations for records they keep about the children in their care.&nbsp; While the quality of records of assessment and planning is still variable, educators keep attractive records about children&rsquo;s care and learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Educators also indicate through their narrative writing that they understand the &lsquo;notice, recognise, respond and revisit&rsquo; pattern of working with children.&nbsp; KidStart visiting teachers have identified the need to further support educators to evaluate the effectiveness of their programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Visiting teachers have improved their own record keeping and now follow up visits to each child with written reports to parents and educators.&nbsp; They also write a report about the child&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; More frequent use of email has improved contact with parents.&nbsp; Documentation is now linked to provide a clear record of programmes, support and development over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Leadership and support.&nbsp; The team leader has established teamwork and mutual support amongst visiting teachers.&nbsp; As a result, visiting teachers use positive, collaborative approaches in their work with educators and families.&nbsp; The team leader&rsquo;s valuable support is available to educators as well as visiting teachers. &nbsp;Members of the visiting teacher team have opportunities to extend their own learning through relevant professional development.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for development and review</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Self review.&nbsp; The area manager and team leader have identified that self review is still an area for development.&nbsp; While a framework for undertaking reviews has been developed, it is still in the early stages of use as a tool for evaluating processes and guiding necessary change.&nbsp; As part of its continued work to strengthen the service, KidStart is using self-review processes and acknowledge that they need to improve these to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify areas for improvement in educators&rsquo; practices</li>
<li>design ways of supporting change.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports.&nbsp; This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">KidStart Northcote has one child who identifies as M&#257;ori.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ReportText1stPara">KidStart uses the Barnardos M&#257;ori strategy to guide their development of the service.&nbsp; Visiting teachers are currently engaged in a programme of instruction, &lsquo;Ng&#257; Pou E Wha&rsquo;, to further develop their understanding of and confidence in using bicultural practices.&nbsp; Visiting teachers are enthusiastic about the programme and are finding it informative and practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Visiting teachers have yet to determine how they will use the information they are gaining about bicultural practices to up-skill and support educators.&nbsp; This could be a topic for review once the training programme has been completed.</p>

<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management and staff of KidStart Northcote completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>

<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s&nbsp; self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics </b>&ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation.&nbsp; The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports.&nbsp; Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.<b></b></p></html>
