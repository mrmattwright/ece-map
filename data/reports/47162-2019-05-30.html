</table><p>Atamai Education &amp; Care is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Atamai Education &amp; Care is a home-based service that provides early childhood education and care for up to 80 children from infancy to school age. Educators deliver programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. Most children are of Samoan, Chinese and Filipino cultural backgrounds. This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><p>Atamai Education &amp; Care is led by registered early childhood teachers. The director, business manager and service provider work closely with the team of three programme coordinators.</p><p>The service philosophy promotes the provision of a home-based learning environment that is built on the foundation of trusting, reciprocal and responsive relationships. It highlights service values that appreciate and respect each child so they develop their full potential in an environment of love.</p><p>The director leads a board that governs the service. Clearly defined governance and management roles guide the strategic direction. Additional staff, including an Information Technology team, support the operation and management of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Educators keep good records of each child’s day and note activities that children participated in and enjoyed. Cultural practices are valued and contribute to planning. Children have regular opportunities to participate in playgroups, excursions and planned activities. Learning programmes include literacy, mathematics and science, and the use of creative materials.</p><p>Children's learning is recorded in attractive portfolios and through online portals. Portfolios show educators' responses to children's interests and strengths, and how they provide specifically for infants and toddlers, and children with additional learning needs. Educators share their own cultural knowledge and often document children's learning activities in the child's home language. Programme coordinators guide educators in planning programmes to meet children's needs.</p><p>Service leaders and programme coordinators provide culturally appropriate monitoring and support for educators. Coordinators affirm, model and encourage educators to improve their skills and their understanding of effective teaching strategies. Service leaders are committed to continuous improvement through building the capabilities and skills of all educators and staff.</p><p>Coordinators maintain regular contact with parents and welcome their feedback. Parents would benefit from further support to access the online secure portal that provides ways of communicating with educators and other parents.</p><p>Coordinators know educators well and provide monthly visits to educators' homes. They document these monthly visits well and monitor health and safety practices in homes. Coordinators build on educator knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and effective teaching practices. They are encouraging educators to increase their understanding and use of te reo and tikanga Māori. Coordinators could also help educators to better understand and respond to children's individual interests and learning dispositions. They work collaboratively to promote educator success in the provision of home-based education and care. There is sound induction for new educators and ongoing support to increase their knowledge and improve practices.</p><p>Service operations are guided by a clear vision and philosophy. Strategic plans identify priorities that contribute to the service achieving its vision and are linked to sound accountability practices. This contributes to consistent and sustainable practices across the network<em>.</em></p><p>Health and safety systems and monthly reporting keep service leaders informed of the physical and emotional wellbeing of children and of any issues to be addressed. There are sound recruitment processes, good resource management and clearly defined expectations for coordinators and educators. Service leaders are continuing to strengthen the current appraisal system, to support teachers and educators to become reflective practitioners. Internal evaluation is understood and managed through a sound process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service philosophy and strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' reflection and inquiry into practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of te reo and tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional learning opportunities about inclusive practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the service leaders agree that key next steps for programme coordinators are to continue to build educator capability by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing planning that builds on children's individual interests, and learning dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging in regular targeted professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Atamai Education and Care completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, service leaders need to ensure that accurate recording of children's sleep is carried out.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Home Based ECE Services 2008, HS8, 2.</em></p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>30 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
