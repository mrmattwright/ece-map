</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blue School is a privately owned, all-day early learning service in Greytown. It is licensed for 30 children over two years old. Children attending are aged between three and six years.</p><p>The preschool's philosophy emphasises the 'four Cs' of collaboration, communication, creativity and confidence. This approach is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Collaborative inquiries and projects guide the group programme.</p><p>A centre manager oversees operation. A curriculum leader position has been created to guide teaching and learning. Most teachers are fully registered. The priorities for development outlined in the February 2015 ERO report have been suitably progressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are affirmed as confident, capable investigators. They are encouraged to share their thoughts and ask questions. Teachers plan a rich range of experiences, based on children‚Äôs interests, to engage and challenge the group. Children enjoy close connections with the local community. Weekly excursions into the neighbourhood are usefully linked to inquiry topics. Family and community members are invited to the centre to share their knowledge, further enhancing the localised curriculum.</p><p>Warm and respectful relationships between teachers and children are evident. Nature exploration and environmental sustainability are well embedded in the curriculum. Many play resources are designed and constructed by the group, from recycled materials. Teachers effectively promote children's sense of connection and contribution.</p><p>Teachers regularly discuss and plan targeted teaching strategies for individuals, focusing on their interests, strengths and needs. Leaders acknowledge the need to better align assessment documentation with these plans, to clearly show how individualised teaching has resulted in children's progress.</p><p>Teachers are actively growing their relationships with local marae, iwi and community groups. They have developed some very useful initiatives to engage whƒÅnau MƒÅori. Staff are thoughtfully building their bicultural curriculum. As this develops, teachers should ensure that assessments show how children‚Äôs learning in this area has been enriched, and how MƒÅori children‚Äôs cultural identity is prioritised and affirmed.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are very well supported. Teachers liaise effectively with parents and outside agencies, as appropriate, to plan next learning steps.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about the group curriculum through online assessments, daily photographs and notes, and effective wall displays. A very well-considered range of information is shared between parents and teachers upon induction.</p><p>The centre has developed a range of highly effective, innovative transition-to-school processes. Children and families are very well supported. Teachers are knowledgeable about current school readiness research and practices. Social competence and fine motor skills are effectively promoted, in play-based contexts. Teachers are members of a local network focused on transitions. They have purposefully built close relationships with local schools and teaching staff. Cohort transitioning and reciprocal school visits support children's confidence.</p><p>Teachers are committed to continual growth of their practices for the benefit of children. They draw on research and targeted observations to inform ongoing changes. Leaders agree that a more systematic internal evaluation approach, using a guiding question and measurable indicators of success, should better equip teachers to measure the impact of changes on children's learning outcomes.</p><p>Leadership successfully promotes collaboration and consistent practice. Teachers are reflective and improvement focused. However, the documentation of appraisals is variable. Leaders should support teachers in their understanding of the use of evidence to demonstrate improved outcomes for children. Incorporating formal, targeted observations, and stronger use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> are also next steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's findings reflect the service's self-identified next steps outlined in their strategic plan. ERO‚Äôs evaluation has also highlighted as areas for improvement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>depth of assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specific, evidence-based monitoring and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quality of appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blue School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blue School will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>6 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
