</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Redwood Education and Childcare Centre is part of the BestStart organisation. BestStart is a large national organisation that owns a significant number of early childhood education centres across New Zealand. The centre manager oversees the centre operations and is supported on a weekly basis by a Professional Services Manager and by other BestStart personnel as required.</p><p>Edukids Redwood offers all day education and care for a maximum of 75 infants, toddlers and young children up to school age. The centre is licensed for up to 25 children under two years.</p><p>The centre comprises three rooms. There are two outdoor areas, one for the children under two and the other for the rest of the children. Most of the staff are qualified early childhood education teachers. Three teachers are in training.</p><p>Centre leaders have been responsive to the recommendations made in the 2015 ERO report and, in particular, regarding the use of internal evaluation/self review. They continue to improve bicultural understandings in programmes and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and teachers work collaboratively and respectfully in a positive environment. The vision and philosophy, which were recently reviewed, are strongly reflected throughout the centre's programmes and practices.</p><p>Children's learning and wellbeing are well supported through a flexible approach to programming that is highly responsive to their needs, interests and abilities. Children experience diverse opportunities for exploration, creativity, problem solving and extending their thinking. Teachers encourage and support them to make their own decisions about their learning. They are able to follow areas of special interest in an unhurried and uninterrupted learning environment. Children are comfortable working with others or independently and are thoughtfully guided by staff to develop respectful, caring relationships.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with children to plan and resource well-considered programmes that build on children's prior knowledge and outside experiences as well as their interests and strengths. They are adept at noticing and responding to children's needs and development. They have a sound understanding of the importance of embedding te reo and tikanga Māori in programmes and practices.</p><p>Teachers foster positive and respectful relationships with children, parents and whānau, and parent involvement in their children's learning is encouraged. Children with additional needs, and their families, are well supported.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience warm, nurturing and sensitive relationships in a thoughtfully resourced environment. Their learning and wellbeing are prioritised and promoted through effective communication with parents and programmes which are tailored to each child's needs and development.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and between rooms are well-managed. Children are supported to develop dispositions and skills to facilitate their smooth transition to school, and parents are provided with useful information about transitions.</p><p>Effective leadership of the centre contributes to a well-embedded and shared understanding by staff of the centre's vision and philosophy. This ensures an unrelenting focus on children's learning and wellbeing. Staff work collaboratively and benefit from targeted professional development. This is aligned with the performance management system and the strategic plan to reflect the vision and philosophy. A cohesive leadership team across the centre and the BestStart organisation is effectively building leadership capacity and teacher capability.</p><p>The centre has a well-established culture of reflection that is based on a comprehensive framework for internal evaluation. Findings from internal evaluations are productively used to bring about continued improvement. BestStart provides a high level of professional support and consistency of processes and accountability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers need to build on existing good practice to</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the focus on intentional and explicit teaching strategies in documentation and practice</li>
<li>ensure the acknowledgement of children's language, culture and identity</li>
<li>consistently clarify children's next steps in assessment and planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Redwood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Redwood will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>19 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
