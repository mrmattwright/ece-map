</table><p>Edukids Redwood is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Redwood operates under the Kidicorp management structure. Kidicorp is a large national organisation that owns early childhood centres across New Zealand. Edukids Redwood is a purpose built centre set up as three rooms; a nursery, preschool and a prep-room for the oldest children. The centre is licensed for up to 75 children including up to 25 children under the age of two. The children aged over two, share a large outdoor area. There is a separate spacious outdoor area for infants and toddlers.</p><p>An experienced centre manager efficiently organises the day-to-day running of the centre. There have been some changes in staff since the 2012 ERO review. Most staff are trained early childhood teachers. Many are beginning teachers who are being well supported to work towards full teacher registration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on the importance of collaborative relationships, centre values and on children‚Äôs wellbeing and development. ERO observed many examples of the philosophy in action.</p><p>Teachers interact in positive and meaningful ways with children. They place value on:</p><ul>
<li>responding to and planning for children‚Äôs interests</li>
<li>encouraging children‚Äôs independence, self-help skills and choice</li>
<li>promoting children‚Äôs competence and confidence</li>
<li>using aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori with children</li>
<li>predictable, meaningful, well-paced routines.</li>
</ul><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are welcomed warmly into the centre. Teachers and parents are well informed as children move from one room to the next.</p><p>Children under two years of age receive good-quality education and care. ERO observed routines and interactions that were nurturing, calm and supported infants and toddlers in their learning and exploration. The nursery teachers are committed to providing a home-like environment for these very young children.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have engaged in regular ongoing self review. They have initiated useful developments in assessment, planning and self review. There has been a strong focus on team building that has resulted in a collaborative approach to teacher and centre development.</p><p>Managers provide effective support for centre development. Teachers receive good-quality feedback through the appraisal process and are well supported to reflect on their teaching practice. This was particularly evident with provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>The impact of a recent review of indoor and outdoor areas has provided children with a wide range of accessible and good-quality resources that are purposefully set out by teachers.</p><p>Kidicorp has many systems that are helping centres improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>support to centre managers for the day-to-day operation of their centres from regular visits of education and business managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are in the early stages of implementing some new systems to improve practices. The centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that key next steps to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the ways teachers plan for, assess and evaluate children‚Äôs learning and the programme,</li>
<li>making better use of self-review processes to show the impact of changes for children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>increasing teachers' understandings of bicultural practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Redwood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Redwood will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>2 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
