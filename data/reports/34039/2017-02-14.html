</table><p>The service needs further support to develop the quality of the programme in order to provide positive outcomes for children. A number of legislative requirements in relation to health and safety have also been identified.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Thames Early Childhood Education Centre is owned and operated by an incorporated trust. It provides all-day education and care for children from birth to school age. The service is licensed for 49 children, including up to 14 under two years of age. There are 9 of children who identify as Māori. Since the previous ERO review in 2012 a new board of trustees has been elected, a new leadership team is in place and several new teachers have been appointed.</p><p>The centre philosophy is to provide a nurturing inclusive learning environment for children. The centre aims to prepare tamariki and their whānau for life in a bicultural environment that empower children to be successful.</p><p>Bicultural partnerships, programme planning and assessment were areas identified for improvement in the 2012 ERO review. These are areas continue to require development. The centre has been receiving external professional development about management and governance with support from the Ministry of Education.</p><p>There is now an urgent need to develop and implement a planned approach to strategic planning and self review including:</p><ul>
<li>a detailed annual plan</li>
<li>relevant professional development and learning for trustees and teachers</li>
<li>appraisal systems to build teacher professional capability.</li>
</ul><p>This is necessary to provide clarity of strategic direction and a sound foundation for ongoing review and improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers warmly welcome children, parents and whānau each day. They know children well and interactions are sensitive and appropriate. Teachers foster children's language and mathematical skills through integrated play activities and interactions. Children's efforts and success are affirmed by teachers as they engage them in conversations. The learning environment provides children with appropriate levels of physical challenge and opportunities for active play. A useful next step, to promote positive outcomes for children, is for teachers and leaders to more prepare the environment to more effectively invite children's interest and promote their independence.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's needs for care and support. Te reo and aspects of tikanga Māori are visible in the centre. Teachers strongly acknowledge Māori as tangata whenua and the partnership with whānau. Teachers have a good understanding of children and their whānau aspirations. There are strong respectful relationships between teachers, children, parents and whānau.</p><p>The programmes of learning is planned in response to children's interests and ideas. A feature of the programme is the trips into the local and wider community. Children's assessment portfolios provide a valuable record of their involvement in the programme. These documents clearly identify the learning that is occurring and some include reference to next learning steps. Teachers now need to develop shared understandings about practices for programme planning, assessment and evaluation. In addition, leaders and teachers need to establish a curriculum for the service that includes shared priorities for teaching and learning.</p><p>A newly elected governance board and a recently appointed leadership team are now managing centre operations. Under guidance from the Ministry of Education an external consultant has worked with the board and teachers to write a strategic plan for the service. Some spontaneous review has occurred and a useful schedule is in place for planned review of policies and procedures. Further developments are required to establish a strategic plan that provides a sound foundation for ongoing centre review and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board and leaders must give urgent priority to the following areas for review and development:</p><ul>
<li>Leadership in an early childhood learning environment.</li>
<li>Programme planning, assessment and evaluation.</li>
<li>Professional learning and development for teachers aligned to individual learning needs and centre priorities.</li>
<li>Curriculum design, including priorities for teacher practice and children's learning.</li>
<li>Strategic planning and self review.</li>
<li>The provision of systems to monitor and maintain a safe environment for children. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Thames Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>Regular and ongoing self-review for all centre operations, focused on identifying strategic priorities for improving outcomes for children, is implemented.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 6]</em></li>
<li>The governance board and centre leaders develop and annual plan to provide documented guidance for the services operations. This plan needs to provide a sound foundation or ongoing self review and improvement in outcomes for children.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 8]</em></li>
<li>Governance: Board and centre leaders need to implement a system of regular staff appraisal. This is necessary to provide a planned approach to the way teachers are improving their practice. It is also necessary to more fully meet the requirement of the Education Council of Aotearoa.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 7]</em></li>
<li>Ensure current policies and procedures for staff appointments document and enact the requirement of the Vulnerable Children's Act (2016).<br><em>[Reference Vulnerable Children's Act (2016)]</em></li>
<li>Governance: Board and centre leaders, ensure that heavy furniture, fixtures and fittings that could fall or topple and cause serious injury and or damage are secured.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centre 2008, GMA Health and Safety 7 12]</em></li>
<li>Governance and centre leaders need to ensure that the documented guidelines for excursions outside of the centre are consistently followed.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centre 2008, GMA Health and Safety 17 18]</em></li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Thames Early Childhood Education Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>14 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
