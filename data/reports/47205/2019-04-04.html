</table><p>Blossoms Educare Rolleston Limited is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blossoms Educare Rolleston Limited is a privately owned early childhood care and education service that opened in 2016. The service is part of a national umbrella organisation. It caters for children from birth-to-school age from a diverse learning community. This is the first ERO report for this service.</p><p>A cluster manager and a centre manager have worked together to establish the service and lead the day to day operation of the service. There were some significant changes to the teaching teams in 2018. Most staff are registered early childhood teachers. The purpose built property provides separate open-learning areas for children under two-years-old and for children over two-years-old. There are many opportunities for siblings and mixed aged groups of children to play with one another.</p><p>The philosophy for the service focuses on fostering supportive, respectful and responsive relationships. It states children are valued as individuals and supported to develop a positive sense of belonging and respect. It outlines a belief that children learn best through play and education at their own pace and when they are happy and having fun.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted time to explore the spacious, well organised learning areas that offers a broad range of learning experiences. This includes giving emphasis to oral language development, creativity, social competencies and physical challenges. Literacy, mathematics and bicultural perspectives are integrated in ways that are meaningful to children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have easy access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration. There are comfortable, safe places that cater for children who are not yet mobile and for those who are crawling and learning to walk.</p><p>Leaders have a strong commitment to promoting teaching and learning practices that contribute to positive outcomes for children. They are building a reflective team culture, and understanding of inquiry and evaluative practice that is focused improving outcomes for children.</p><p>All teachers are actively involved in targeted external and internal professional learning and development (PLD). Ongoing support and mentoring is well-paced and personalised to meet the needs of individual teachers and teams to sustain and extend knowledge and skills. This includes the positive impact of recent PLD on Te WhƒÅriki 2017 and on the planning for the learning that matters here.</p><p>At the time of this review centre leaders and managers acknowledged that they had sought guidance and support from the Ministry of Education to resolve some staffing issues. Through a systematic internal evaluation process they have now strengthened policies and practices to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all children and staff, and have resolved the issues.</p><p>Leaders are implementing and are embedding effective systems and processes to support the new teaching teams and the operation of the service. These systems and processes are aligned to the national and local strategic priorities, centre inquiry and appraisal. Robust performance management processes and practices are building leadership capacity and teacher capability.</p><p>Blossoms Educare Rolleston is well-led and managed by a collaborative, capable leadership team. They are committed to establishing a shared philosophy that gives emphasis to fostering supportive, respectful relationships with children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service managers and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give greater prominence to te ao MƒÅori to strengthen the provision of a bicultural curriculum for all children and opportunities for MƒÅori to succeed as MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment processes and consistency of practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine and embed recently developed group planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the depth of understanding of internal evaluation across the teaching teams.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blossoms Educare Rolleston Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>4 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
