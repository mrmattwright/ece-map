</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) is privately owned and one of eight Little Wonder Childcare services across New Zealand. These services are currently in a transition phase to new ownership.</p><p>A centre manager has responsibility for the centre and is new to the role since the 2015 ERO review. She manages two Little Wonder Childcare services in Dunedin. Since her appointment staffing has been stable. The centre manager is supported by a team of head teachers who have day-to-day responsibility for the education programmes. The centre is full day and licensed for 100 children aged three months to five years. The children receive education and care across five classrooms.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2015 the owner and leadership team have made significant improvements to the service and addressed all of ERO‚Äôs recommendations. These included management of staffing changes and establishing organisational expectations and systems to monitor the quality of centre processes and teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A useful centre philosophy reflects the teachers‚Äô values and beliefs and identifies the key learning priorities for children. Comprehensive strategic and annual plans identify the service's vision and goals. These plans have been carefully designed to build the service across all aspects of the operation.</p><p>Teachers work with intention and purpose, using a range of effective strategies, to affirm children and extend their thinking. They are collaborative and enthusiastic about their work. The learning programmes in each room are specifically planned to support children‚Äôs interests and engagement with learning. Teachers' shared understanding of the intended learning is building children‚Äôs confidence, independence, and social abilities.¬†</p><p>Teachers enable children to learn through their interests. Children play and work for sustained periods of time alone, alongside others, or with teachers. They follow well-established routines and their teachers have clear expectations for behaviour. Children have positive relationships with one another and their teachers, and show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Other features that contribute to positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strong support for oral language development, as well as early mathematics and literacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers regularly reflecting on and evaluating the impact of programmes and teaching on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers seeking regular input from parents and making good use of their responses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good processes and support for children transitioning into, across and out of the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well-considered support for children with additional needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children in the infant and toddler rooms receive a high level of care. The calm, relaxed environments and nurturing relationships ensure children‚Äôs emotional needs are being met. Teachers work with parents to ensure routines are consistent with home life. Teachers are very responsive to young children's verbal and non-verbal cues. They use every opportunity to promote oral language, grow children‚Äôs independence and extend their social development.</p><p>Teachers value te reo MƒÅori, and MƒÅori knowledge, perspectives and tikanga. The centre environment, resources and programmes reflect this commitment. As a result, children have many opportunities to learn about New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Teachers see this as an area for ongoing development and learning.</p><p>The service is managed well by an able and collaborative centre manager. She has built leadership and teacher capability through provision of relevant professional development. She and the head teachers make good use of teachers' individual strengths and interests to enrich children's learning. Leaders and teachers show a sound understanding of effective internal evaluation. This has led to well-informed change and ongoing improvement in centre systems, practices and programmes.</p><p>The leaders have identified that they now need to consolidate the changes made. They are aware that their next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use internal evaluation to build good practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural development and the integration of MƒÅori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review, refine and build assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>18 July 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
