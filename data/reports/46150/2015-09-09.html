</table><p>Systems and practices at Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) require further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) is a new, purpose-built education and care centre in Dunedin. It opened in March 2013 and has experienced strong roll growth. It is one of eight Little Wonders centres in New Zealand.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for up to 100 children aged from birth-to-school age. Families attend from many parts of Dunedin, and appreciate the extended opening hours the centre provides. The children play and learn in five different rooms according to their ages. The centre provides meals for the children.</p><p>A priority for the manager since the centre opened has been to develop a philosophy that states what is important for children to learn at the centre. Teachers aim to foster respectful relationships with children and their families. They want children to have the skills to develop friendships, independence and communication and to have fun in their learning.</p><p>At the time of this review there were significant staff changes at the centre. This includes changes in the leadership and management team. A process was underway to seek and appoint a new manager. A range of experienced and beginning teachers are employed.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The manager, with the support of the teachers, has worked hard to establish this new centre. Teachers form positive relationships with children and their families. They have a variety of ways to communicate with parents about their children‚Äôs care, interests and learning. There are planned transitions for children into the centre and between rooms.</p><p>The children enjoy a range of learning experiences including art, visitors to the centre, and a focus on early literacy and numeracy for the older children. The manager has led ongoing staff development to ensure that profile books are an attractive record of the children‚Äôs learning and experiences at the centre. Guidelines now need to be developed to ensure this work continues.</p><p>The teachers are continuing to develop their planning and assessment practices. They still need to develop a centre-wide approach to group planning to ensure they help children achieve the outcomes expressed in the philosophy and identified needs within the centre. One such need is to help all children to develop their oral language capability.</p><p>The manager has developed a useful strategic plan. Many of the goals in this plan are in the early stages of being implemented. She has documented the many developments that have occurred in the centre since opening. It is timely now to review how well these developments contribute to the centre achieving its goals. The manager identified that teachers are still developing their use and understanding of self review.</p><p>While there is a network for the leaders of the eight Little Wonders centres to meet and provide mutual support, the owner has recognised that centre leaders and managers need more formal and intensive support to enable them in their roles. At the time of this review a contract to provide support had just been confirmed.</p><p>The owner provides a policy framework to guide the centre operations. The systems in place are not robust and comprehensive enough to confirm for the owner:</p><ul>
<li>whether or not the centre is meetings its legal requirements</li>
<li>how well it is providing for the children‚Äôs education and care.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre owner is to improve the systems within the centre to give better guidance to ensure his expectations are met. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing a job description for the manager</li>
<li>strengthening the guidelines and expectations for effective appraisal and performance management</li>
<li>ensuring that the manager receives training to use the appraisal system</li>
<li>developing robust advice and guidance guidelines for beginning teachers.</li>
</ul><p>The owner needs to receive better evaluative information about how well the centre is operating. He needs to know:</p><ul>
<li>how well the centre is making progress towards achieving its and the Little Wonders group goals</li>
<li>how well the centre is meeting all its legal obligations and requirements.</li>
</ul><p>The owner acknowledges the need to provide comprehensive support for the new manager and leaders during this time of change within the centre.</p><p>Leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>review and update the philosophy to reflect the changes to the teaching team</li>
<li>develop centre-wide priorities and planning for groups of children‚Äôs learning based on the philosophy and identified needs within the centre</li>
<li>develop guidelines for the centre‚Äôs expectations for individual planning</li>
<li>strengthen, improve and monitor the quality and use of planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>further develop teachers‚Äô use and understanding of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and develop plans to address the key next steps outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Childcare (Roslyn) will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
