</table><p>ABC Halswell is Well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Halswell operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood education centres across New Zealand.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been significant changes in staffing, including leadership positions. A new centre manager and head teachers for each room were appointed in 2015. Due to a steady increase in the roll, three new teachers have also been appointed. Most staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The professional service manager and business manager have provided consistent high quality support and expertise during this critical period of change. A planned and purposeful response to the recommendations in the previous ERO report has resulted in good progress in all areas including self review, assessment, planning and bicultural practices.</p><p>The centre has three separate classrooms, within two neighbouring houses, to cater for the specific care and education needs of infants, toddlers and young children. Staff have created attractive, home-like learning environments for children. A planned re-development of the spacious outside learning areas is scheduled to begin in 2016.</p><p>The centre manager and staff are involved in the local learning cluster with other early childhood centres and schools. The focus is on supporting the education of all children in the community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Managers and teachers have developed a strong shared philosophy that is clearly visible in the learning programme and teaching practices. They foster respectful, positive relationships with children and families. Children benefit from caring and responsive interactions with teachers within calm and predictable learning environments.</p><p>Parents and whānau are actively encouraged to be part of the centre and be involved in their child's learning journey. The increasingly diverse cultural backgrounds of families are valued and celebrated. The strengths of some teachers are well used to support others to provide children with opportunities to learn about te ao Māori in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the Māori culture. </p><p>Teachers provide good quality child-centred learning programmes that are particularly strong in the preschool and the nursery. Teachers are responsive to children’s interests, strengths and capabilities. They help to foster children's confidence in themselves and sense of belonging at the centre. Children are well supported to transition into and within the centre, and onto school.</p><p>Teachers offer learning programmes that reflect children's interests and promote children’s active engagement in creative, exploratory play. The programme and teacher practices are based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, the centre philosophy and current research.</p><p>Well defined and attractive areas promote children's curiosity and involvement in a wide range of interesting activities. Children are actively involved in spacious outdoor areas that provide ample room for physical play and increasing opportunities for children to learn about nature. Teachers make purposeful links to the wider community, including some local schools, to further enhance the learning programme. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the learning programme.</p><p>Children are well supported to take responsibility for themselves, to care for others and for the environment. Teachers encourage children's independence, social and cooperative skills. They empower older children to make decisions about their learning and develop skills to listen to and negotiate with others.</p><p>The wellbeing of infants and toddlers in the nursery is actively promoted through nurturing relationships with consistent teacher practices. Children benefit from caring and respectful interactions, and child-focused, unhurried routines within a small group setting. The environment and programme are carefully considered and particularly well suited to the needs of very young children. </p><p class="TableParagraph">Parents and whānau are well informed about their children’s interests and participation in the learning through informative wall displays, personalised profile books and digital technologies such as online learning stories and videos.</p><p>The centre manager, business manager and professional services manager work in partnership to implement BestStart systems effectively. This includes the alignment of key guiding documents, quality assurance processes and health and safety practices. Managers are focussed on accurately identifying and strengthening areas for further development.</p><p>Managers have high expectations and specific strategies to empower and build on teacher capability, reflective practices and leadership skills. Managers and teachers make good use of internal evaluation to inform and address centre priorities to improve outcomes for children. Regular and targeted professional development and mentoring is provided to staff to help them build reflective and evaluative practices. </p><p>There is a strong shared focus on continuous improvement and promoting positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have identified, and ERO evaluation confirmed, that the key next step for leaders is to:</p><ul>
<li>build on best of current practice to promote greater centre-wide consistency in areas such as assessment, planning, evaluative practices and bicultural perspectives.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Halswell completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Halswell will be in three years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>9 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
