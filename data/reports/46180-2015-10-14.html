</table><p>Timaru Christian Preschool is in the early stages of developing an effective management and leadership framework. Teachers have participated in professional development provided by the Ministry of Education. They have yet to fully use the knowledge gained to put in place systems and practices to promote ongoing improvement for high quality learning and teaching for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Timaru Christian Preschool is a small, privately-owned centre providing care and education for up to 45 children from two years old to school age. The preschool is located in two refurbished classrooms on the same site as TimaruChristianPrimary School. It has been operating since April 2013. This is the preschool’s first ERO Review.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is strongly focused on Christian principles and building partnerships with families. All teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The supervision of children is above the minimum requirements.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are warmly welcomed into the inclusive, calm environment of the preschool. They play together cooperatively. Children have many opportunities to choose activities from a range of equipment and resources in spacious indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>Children experience positive, respectful interactions with their teachers. They are encouraged to be independent and to develop their self-help skills. Teachers include several aspects of literacy, numeracy and bicultural practices in the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers identify children’s interests in child assessment and make good links between the home and preschool. Children with diverse needs are well supported. Where needed, the centre seeks external advice to assist parents and children.</p><p>Teachers are strongly focused on building partnerships with parents and supporting the needs of families. They provide parents with a range of opportunities to contribute their ideas and views.</p><p>Transitions into the preschool and to school are flexible. Teachers have a positive relationship with the on-site school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree on the need to give high priority to developing and implementing effective management practices to improve the performance of the preschool. This includes building the capability of managers and teachers to improve the outcomes of learning and teaching. The managers need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared centre vision and strategic plan [GMA Regulation 47 (1) (c) (i)]</li>
<li>define and document clear leadership and management roles and responsibilities  [GMA Regulation 47 (1) (c) (i)]</li>
<li>establish and implement clear expectations and robust performance management systems including regular appraisal processes for all teachers [GMA Regulation 47 (1) (c) (i)]</li>
<li>increase leadership capacity and effectiveness</li>
<li>clarify and consolidate a shared approach to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Timaru Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>ensure appropriate documents are developed, maintained and regularly reviewed.<br> <em>[47(1)(c)(i) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consults with the Ministry of Education and  develop plans to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Timaru Christian Preschool will be within two years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>14 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
