</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori @ Otumoetai is located in the Tauranga suburb of Otumoetai in close proximity to a primary school with two Montessori classes and caters for children over two to six years of age. The Centre is licensed for 30 children and has a current roll of 34 children of whom seven identify as Māori.</p><p>The statement of philosophy reflects the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and Dr Maria Montessori. It makes clear reference to a stimulating environment where children can learn through a process of self-discovery while ensuring their holistic nature, mind, body and spirit are developed. The centre acknowledges and respects all cultures.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review a new centre manager with strong expertise in the Montessori approach has been appointed. The building upgrades have enhanced the indoor and outdoor environments. The area for review identified in the 2012 ERO report related to strengthening the use and understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori. This process is in the early stages of development. </p><p>The centre operates under the management structure of BestStart Educare Ltd and is owned by the Wright Family Foundation. Staff are well supported by a professional service manager (with a Montessori background) and a business manager. The centre manager provides leadership for teachers, parents, whānau, and children to deepen their understanding of Montessori philosophy and practice.</p><p>A safe, physical and emotional learning environment is provided for children and staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Montessori @ Otumoetai, provides high quality Montessori based education for young children. The programme structure effectively supports children to become independent learners and develop responsibility. It includes natural, informal integration of independent learning and play. Teachers work collaboratively and their professional commitment, dedication and reflection processes provide positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>The Montessori prepared environment encompasses sequential learning and is specifically designed and resourced to maximise each child’s ability to choose and self direct their own learning. They freely explore using a range of specialist Montessori resources and equipment. Children have extensive opportunity to participate in practical life skills, to care for themselves and others, and contribute to the learning environment. Children are capable and confident learners.</p><p>Interactions between adults and children are positive and respectful. A wide range of assessment approaches are used to evaluate children’s individual learning progress. Teachers use skilled observations to build on children’s interest and promote self-initiated learning. They use intentional teaching strategies, which empower children to better understand their roles and responsibilities as they work through the different phases of Montessori learning processes.</p><p>A strong integration of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and Montessori philosophy allows children to experience a depth of teaching and learning experiences. Teachers notice, recognise, respond and extend children's thinking through respectful and positive interactions. There is calm, quiet intervention and redirection of children by teachers when required. Children respond well to these interventions and willingly accept leadership roles within the daily programme.</p><p>Children learn through play in spacious, attractive learning environments. These areas are well designed and enable children to have active and quiet spaces to play and learn. It provides opportunities for them to access a wide range of resources for prolonged periods of time. Children are fully immersed in a mathematics and language-rich environment.  </p><p>Early development and implementation of Maori concepts are woven through the programme and include daily karakia, waiata and te reo Māori instruction where children's responses are encouraged.</p><p>Parents expressed high satisfaction with the approachability of staff and the open communication that keeps them informed about their child’s social progress and their responses to the programme and activities.</p><p>A knowledgeable and experienced centre manager is successfully increasing teachers, children and parents understanding of the Montessori approach. The development of a three-year strategic plan should ensure this Montessori approach is sustained. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Areas for future development are:</p><ul>
<li>to develop more in-depth planning and development of tikanga Māori, teaching and learning practices across the programme</li>
<li>to enhance, encourage, and actively support a more sustainable partnership between parents, whānau, and centre staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori @ Otumoetai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori @ Otumoetai will be in four years. </p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>6 May 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
