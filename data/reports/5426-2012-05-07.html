<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergarten Isleworth Road operates between 8.30 am and 2.30 pm, five days per week. It provides care and education for children over the age of two.</p><p>Children come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and for some English is their second language. All teachers at the Kindergarten are early childhood trained and fully registered.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Since the kindergarten&rsquo;s last ERO review in June 2008 there have been changes to the makeup of the teaching team and to the hours of operation. The newly formed teaching team is continuing to improve aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programmes and practices. This includes developing more ways for children to lead their own learning.</p><p>Other positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>a warm, welcoming environment and culture</li>
<li>the wide variety of learning opportunities</li>
<li>significant community involvement and consultation.</li>
</ul><p>The education service manager and teachers agree that the next steps for the kindergarten include further developing some aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment, programme planning and evaluation.</p><p>Leadership and effective management practices help teachers to foster team work and work collaboratively.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were still responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, and personnel. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Isleworth Road was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Isleworth Road.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The kindergarten vision states that children are valued as individual learners and their interests and abilities will be recognised, supported and extended. Teachers focus on providing a welcoming, friendly and safe environment. Collaborative partnerships between teachers, parents and children are fostered and all cultures are embraced.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><h4>Relationships</h4><p>Children, parents and teachers have warm, positive and respectful relationships. These relationships contribute to a strong sense of belonging for children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers know all children well and are responsive to their individual needs and interests.</p><h4>Children as competent learners</h4><p>Children are well supported to take an active part in the programme. They are given many opportunities to develop responsibility and take leadership roles. This supports children to develop confidence and independence. ERO observed children playing cooperatively for sustained periods of times. Teachers effectively involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play and support and encourage children&rsquo;s participation. They give children many opportunities to develop and revisit their learning.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p>Children learn and play in high quality indoor and outdoor areas. Teachers make the best use of available spaces to provide a variety of well-considered learning activities, including physical and creative challenges. Children are provided with a wide range of easily accessible resources.</p><h4>Curriculum/programme planning and assessment</h4><p>Teachers have developed an interesting and appropriate programme that recognises and includes children&rsquo;s identified interests, needs and abilities. They have effectively integrated literacy and numeracy into a wide range of learning activities. New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage is well represented within the kindergarten&rsquo;s practices and learning environment. Parent&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s contributions are clearly evident in individual learning portfolios.</p><h4>Community involvement</h4><p>Parents and wh&#257;nau are actively involved in all aspects of the kindergarten. Teachers and parents regularly share information about children&rsquo;s interests and needs. Parents are welcome in the kindergarten at all times and often participate in learning programmes. Teachers make good use of family expertise to add to children&rsquo;s learning. They also provide useful information for parents including making children&rsquo;s learning more visible and useful for parents.</p><h4>Reflective teaching team</h4><p>The teaching team works well together to ensure positive outcomes for children&rsquo;s well-being and learning. Teachers regularly and collaboratively reflect on children&rsquo;s participation and learning to help guide their planning. Teachers receive regular feedback and professional development from their education service manager.</p><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><h4>Assessment, programme planning and evaluation</h4><p>Teachers should review how they build on individual children&rsquo;s prior learning to show progress over time. This includes clear descriptions of the teaching practices used to extend children&rsquo;s learning and how assessment information is used for individuals.</p><p>Teachers collect good information on children&rsquo;s learning. They should now consider more ways to evaluate the impact that teaching practices have on the way children learn.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Isleworth Road completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.

It provides care and education for children over the age of two.</p><p>Children come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and for some English is their second language. All teachers at the Kindergarten are early childhood trained and fully registered.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Since the kindergarten&rsquo;s last ERO review in June 2008 there have been changes to the makeup of the teaching team and to the hours of operation. The newly formed teaching team is continuing to improve aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programmes and practices. This includes developing more ways for children to lead their own learning.</p><p>Other positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>a warm, welcoming environment and culture</li>
<li>the wide variety of learning opportunities</li>
<li>significant community involvement and consultation.</li>
</ul><p>The education service manager and teachers agree that the next steps for the kindergarten include further developing some aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment, programme planning and evaluation.</p><p>Leadership and effective management practices help teachers to foster team work and work collaboratively.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were still responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, and personnel. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
