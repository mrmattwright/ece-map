</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Immanuel Preschool (Mangere) provides all-day and sessional services for 30 children including up to 10 children under two years of age. Most children at the centre are Indian or Samoan with a small number of MƒÅori children attending. Children over two years of age use the building in front of the property, and the under two year old children use the cabin in the back.</p><p>The centre is one of four Immanuel Preschools. The owner is the director and manager of this Mangere centre. She is supported by a business manager, supervisor, assistant supervisor and teachers. The teachers reflect the various ethnicities of the community.</p><p>The centre's philosophy expresses a philosophical approach that incorporates free choice and structured planned activities to extend children's interests alongside Christian values.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified strengths including the visibility of children's cultural identities, and support for the language and identity of MƒÅori children. These practices continue to be evident. Key suggestions for improvement centred on teachers developing assessment practices to extend children's learning and interests, and recording children's progress over time. Some good progress has been made.</p><p>The under two years area for children was identified in the 2014 ERO report as needing improved food handling and toilet facilities. This continues to be a priority as the area has no access to running water.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be confident, enthusiastic learners and to enjoy a sense of belonging. Teachers are skilled at supporting children with settling into the centre. They know children well and have developed a good rapport with them. Teachers interact with children in responsive ways building strong relationships across all age groups. Children participate frequently in conversations with each other and with adults. Teachers foster friendships amongst children and work with them in small groups.</p><p>Children's cultural identities are valued and visible in the centre. Families are greeted in a variety of home languages as they arrive. Children and families with English as an additional language are well supported and some teachers are multilingual. Teachers work with families and external agencies to ensure that children with additional needs enjoy positive experiences in the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers engage and are well settled in their area. Teachers prioritise the formation of secure attachments in a calm environment, and engage in responsive caregiving practices.</p><p>Learning environments have easily accessible equipment and relevant resources. These offer children opportunities to learn and play confidently both indoors and outdoors. The centre prioritises resources that focus on extending literacy, numeracy, and science knowledge. Teachers should consider ways to extend children's learning and create opportunities for children to problem solve and lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers observe children's interests and plan to extend children's skills and knowledge. They identify children's dispositions for learning and seek children's input into planning the programme. It would be worthwhile for them to develop a shared understanding of each child as a unique learner and use dispositions to inform their planning. Teachers are continuing to build their knowledge and understanding of the 2017 revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em></p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for whƒÅnau to become involved in centre events and celebrations. Parents and whƒÅnau meet with teachers to share their aspirations and set goals for children. Teachers respond positively to parent aspirations and make appropriate changes to improve outcomes for children. To enhance learning partnerships with parents<em>,</em> teachers could consider further ways to use <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to discuss children's learning and progress.</p><p>Internal evaluation at the centre is regular, collaborative, supported by evidence, and follows a good framework. Teachers should now begin to evaluate and document the impact of their teaching practices on outcomes for children.</p><p>A clear vision and philosophy guide the programme and practice with a focus on bicultural practices. Some aspects of the Christian philosophy are clearly evident in practice. Teachers could now evaluate the extent to which the programme supports the enactment of their philosophy and its alignment with teaching approaches identified in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Well-developed policies and good systems and processes provide guidance for everyday operations, teaching and learning. There is a high level of organisational trust between the teaching team and management. Appraisals are regular, and teachers access professional learning based on their individual goals and the centre's strategic direction. The centre's appraisal policy needs to include reference to the Education Standards to align with Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><p>using children's dispositions to inform planning and extend their learning</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to build team understanding and use of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (2017) to strengthen assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>developing teaching practices that empower children to think and lead their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Immanuel Preschool (Mangere) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the service needs to provide access to running water in the area for children under two years.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Immanuel Preschool (Mangere) will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>7 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
