</table><p>Farm Cove Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Farmcove Kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over two years of age. It offers six-hour days and serves a culturally diverse community. It is located in the grounds of Wakaraanga Primary School.</p><p>The kindergarten is staffed by a head teacher and three other registered teachers, a teaching assistant, a teacher aide and an administrator. Teachers have continued the good teaching practices noted in ERO‚Äôs 2016 report. Since the 2016 ERO report a new teaching team and head teacher have been appointed.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is based on the values atawhai, respect, trust and inclusiveness. Teachers encourage children to self-manage, initiate play with others, build friendships and be resilient. Their teaching approach is founded on the principles, strands and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers have fully engaged in the AKA Whakamanawa programme to strengthen their bicultural practices.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides leadership, a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel and programmes of professional learning and development for staff. A new AKA structure and new leadership roles have been established, and new personnel appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and capable learners. They play cooperatively, have fun and enjoy opportunities to be leaders and innovators. They show care and concern for others and an eagerness to learn. Children happily share their ideas in sustained conversations with teachers and their peers. They celebrate their own and other children's achievements.</p><p>Children learn in a very well resourced environment that encourages them to explore, and to initiate and sustain play. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are promoted in the kindergarten. Resources, displays and equipment affirm children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds and reflect their current interests and ideas. The large outdoor area provides good opportunities for natural science, physical challenge and imaginative play. Children have a strong sense of belonging in and ownership of their kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers value and facilitate child-led, play-based learning. They encourage children to share ideas, develop their own theories and build on what they already know. They nurture children‚Äôs curiosity, creativity and problem solving through play. Children‚Äôs oral language and use of writing, mathematics and science are extended through skilful teaching strategies woven into everyday experiences.</p><p>Respectful and responsive relationships between adults and children contribute to the strong sense of community in the kindergarten. Although the teaching team is relatively new, teachers know children and their whƒÅnau well. Teachers actively encourage parent and whƒÅnau engagement in children‚Äôs learning. They keep whƒÅnau well informed, provide many ways for them to share their aspirations and encourage them to share their strengths. Transitions to school are well supported and teachers are looking for ways to further strengthen this process.</p><p>Teachers provide a well-planned, inclusive programme that is responsive to children's strengths, cultures and interests. The programme reflects <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and provides meaningful learning experiences for children. Comprehensive programme documentation makes children's learning and parents' aspirations visible. Children‚Äôs portfolios, including e-portfolios, are highly valued and frequently added to by families.</p><p>Teachers maintain a calm, nurturing atmosphere in which children have space and time to explore, play and learn at their own pace. They reflect on their own practice and continuously look for additional ways to support children's wellbeing and learning. Teachers are focused on promoting equity and positive educational outcomes for children. They work collaboratively, share strengths and have areas of leadership.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes are focused on improving teachers' practice and outcomes for children. The head teacher provides professional leadership and leads with a shared vision and clear direction for the future.</p><p>The AKA continues to provide support for kindergartens to strengthen bicultural practices. In many instances this has made a significant difference to teachers' confidence and capability. Specialist support impacts positively on teachers‚Äô inclusion of children with additional learning needs. Priority is being given to re-establishing and supporting Parent WhƒÅnau Groups in all kindergartens. The strategic direction being established by new AKA leaders is providing a positive framework for kindergartens‚Äô annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the kindergarten include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the use of internal evaluation to focus on the effectiveness of kindergarten processes and practices and guide kindergarten developments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine assessment and planning practices through more visible continuity of learning in portfolios, including how progress is evaluated over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would be useful for AKA managers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify new roles and engage teaching teams in the implementation of the new structure across the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen internal evaluation at all levels of the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some kindergartens, across the AKA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Farm Cove Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
