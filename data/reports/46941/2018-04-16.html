</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Above and Beyond The Lakes Ltd is a privately owned and operated early education and care service in the new 'Lakes' housing area on the outskirts of Tauranga. It is one of four Above and Beyond services that operate across the Western Bay of Plenty. This is the first ERO review for the service, which opened in 2016.</p><p>The centre offers all-day education and care and is licensed for 85 children, including 25 aged under two years. Currently 117 children attend, which includes four MƒÅori and many children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Four age-related areas operate to meet the needs of infants and children up to school age. The centre is supported by an educational leader. Governance is provided by the Above and Beyond Education and Care organisation. The centre has a commitment to appointing teachers with a recognised early childhood education qualification. Currently the ratio of qualified teachers exceeds Ministry of Education requirements.</p><p>The philosophy is based on the belief that ‚Äòchildren should be immersed in love and that childhood is a time for fun and exploration‚Äô. The curriculum is arts-based and follows children‚Äôs interests and strengths.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Governors and leaders have developed effective systems that promote stability in staffing, leadership and management in the centre. A clear vison and annual plan have been established to guide centre development. Comprehensive policies and procedures are in place to monitor children‚Äôs health and safety. Centre governance and strategic direction reflect a commitment to quality outcomes for children and contribute to high levels of engagement with families.</p><p>Expectations and guidelines have been established to support effective self review of all aspects of the service. Leaders' systematic implementation of these guidelines is resulting in improvement to the service for children and families. Ongoing review includes consultation with parents and whƒÅnau to involve them in decisions about their children‚Äôs education and care. Leadership across the Above and Beyond organisation is contributing to positive outcomes for children and ongoing improvement to the service.</p><p>There are effective systems in place to successfully build teacher capability and improve the quality of the service. Ongoing reflection and targeted professional learning for teachers are evident. High levels of relational trust are also evident across the service and collaborative ways of learning are successfully promoted. Leaders have developed a new process for teacher appraisal. This approach is due to be fully implemented in 2018, which is an important next step for the service.</p><p>The centre curriculum effectively supports children‚Äôs ideas, allows them to lead their learning and follow their interests. The programme in action recognises and supports children to learn through play. The environment is well resourced with a variety of equipment to support children‚Äôs learning and exploration. The outdoor area is large and set up to promote children‚Äôs physical play, risk taking and challenge. Children under two enjoy a calm slow pace where they have time and space to lead their learning. These young children experience interactions that are responsive and respectful in a home-like environment. Children are becoming confident explorers and enquirers, increasingly able to make sense of their world.</p><p>Programme planning practices are effective and allow children to contribute to decisions about their learning. Planning and ongoing evaluation effectively guide teachers to provide a programme that focuses on learning outcomes and next steps. Oral language is strongly promoted. Language and mathematical concepts are integrated throughout the learning programme. Significant learning and development information is shared with parents and whƒÅnau using a web-based system that documents children's assessments. Leaders are working with teachers to ensure assessments consistently show children's progress over time.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective strategies to promote positive outcomes for infants, toddlers and young children. Respectful, reciprocal and responsive relationships between children and teachers are evident across the centre. Routines are well established and support continuity of learning for children. Teachers respond to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and capabilities and reflect on their teaching. This leads them to question, modify and enhance their practice.</p><p>Transition practices through the centre have been reviewed and improved to promote the involvement of children and families throughout the process. Communication with local schools supports children's transition to school. Teachers use karakia, waiata and model te reo MƒÅori as a functional language to support children‚Äôs understanding of the MƒÅori world. The integration of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori to support the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children is an ongoing area for development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre is in the process of reviewing bicultural practice and perspectives in the programme, environment and teaching interactions. This review is needed to ensure the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children and New Zealand's dual cultural heritage are strongly promoted across the centre.</p><p>The new appraisal system that was developed in 2017 now needs to be fully implemented centre wide. The implementation of this process needs to include coverage of all teachers, and mentoring and guidance for provisionally registered teachers. This is likely to further enhance processes to build teacher capability leading to improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Educational leaders need to work with teachers to ensure assessments more clearly show each child's learning progress over time. This should enable teachers to plan and assess more effectively and share information about progress with parents.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Above and Beyond The Lakes Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage is secured <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Above and Beyond The Lakes Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>16 April 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
