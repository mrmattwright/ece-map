</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five on George Street is located in Te Awamutu and operates under the management umbrella of the Kidicorp Corporation. Teachers receive strong, ongoing support from the professional service and business managers. There is a useful policy framework and guidelines to support the daily and long-term operations of the service.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 75 children over two including 20 children under two years of age. At the time of this review there were 83 children enrolled, 11 of these children are identified as MƒÅori. A school transition programme called <em>‚ÄòBe school Ready‚Äô</em> helps children familiarize themselves with the school environment.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review a new centre manager has been appointed and there have been significant changes to staffing. The centre has moved from two licenses to one. The building next to the centre has been purchased to develop an area specifically for the 4-5 year age group and the playground has been updated. There has been development of the agreed priorities in the 2011 ERO report about the programme, planning, learning resources, and teaching practice.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy emphasises positive outcomes for children, teachers and parents. At the heart of their quality service they value; respect, individuality and becoming socially and emotionally confident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes, professional, administrative and business support by well qualified and experienced personnel. These are underpinned by the centre‚Äôs clear vision and values.</p><p>The centre has been through significant changes in management and staffing since the previous ERO review. Staff who remained in the centre through this time of change provided continuity and consistency for families and children. The new centre manager and teachers are working to build positive and collaborative relationships with children, staff and whƒÅnau. Self review has been focused on the centre philosophy and vision. This review is leading to shared values and a new sense of direction for centre development and improvement.</p><p>Teachers value children‚Äôs strengths and interests and support them to engage in sustained play. There are many opportunities for children to visit across the age-based areas and sharing with each other is encouraged. Children under the age of two receive nurture and care in an appropriate safe and inclusive setting. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and well being. Multi-cultural customs and languages are shared throughout the day including baby language sign. Parents contribute their strengths and skills to the daily programme and are welcome to stay with their very young children.</p><p>Older children demonstrate high levels of cooperation and independence as they make choices experiment and explore with their peers and teachers. Children play for sustained periods of time and engage in dramatic and creative play. Trips and excursions to places of local interest and the wider community enrich the curriculum. There is a well planned transition process for children as they move through the centre and on to school. There are close and positive relationships with the local schools. ‚ÄòThe Be School Ready‚Äô approach contributes to children‚Äôs readiness for school.</p><p>Teachers have implemented a new system for planning, evaluation and assessment of children‚Äôs learning. A useful framework has been developed that integrates concepts of MƒÅori cultural values. Children‚Äôs individual profile books record their participation in the programme as well as aspects of their learning and development over time. Centre leaders acknowledge the need to continue to build teacher understanding of planning and assessment that further reflects children‚Äôs individual learning and development.</p><p>ERO observed some high quality teaching practice that promote a positive environment for learning. These practices include:</p><ul>
<li>empowering children to learn self managing life skills</li>
<li>using open questioning and extending children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>maintaining a calm and peaceful environment in the under two area</li>
<li>responding to and extending children‚Äôs learning through a well-resourced environment and deliberately planned experiences.</li>
</ul><p>A particular feature of the centre is the way teachers respond to and extend boys‚Äô interests and strengths.</p><p>Teachers support children to understand the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand by using te reo MƒÅori and waiata during group times. Some teachers are confident in using te reo MƒÅori with children. A next step for the centre is to support all teachers to gain confidence and familiarity in using te reo MƒÅori as part of their regular practice.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that there is a need to strengthen the outcome of self review processes to support high quality learning and care at all times.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids to Five on George Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids to Five on George Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>13 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
