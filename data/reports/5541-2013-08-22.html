</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frankleigh Park Kindergarten is one of sixteen kindergartens that operate under the umbrella of the North Taranaki Kindergarten Association (the association). The association provides clear strategic vision and overarching policies and procedures to guide centre operations. Senior teachers support staff through regular visits that include observations, meetings and written reports.</p><p>The kindergarten is situated in a well established suburb of New Plymouth. Since the August 2010 ERO report the teaching team has increased to three full time teachers and one who is part time. All teachers are fully qualified and registered. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 34 children.</p><p>The older children (generally four year olds) attend five mornings a week (and the younger children (generally three year olds) attend four afternoon sessions. Of a total roll of 62, nine are Māori.</p><p>The attractively presented learning setting is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach, which regards the environment as the third teacher. A strong environmental kaupapa is linked to bicultural perspectives and the kindergarten’s philosophy.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the North Taranaki Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers successfully build on children’s interests and strengths. They skillfully facilitate learning by encouraging children to investigate and explore. Projects often evolve from children’s interests and curiosities.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are integrated into the curriculum. Teachers competently provide many interesting ways for children to write, read and practise mathematical and print concepts. Children confidently express themselves through art, music and dramatic play. Successful transition from the kindergarten to school is supported and encouraged by teachers.</p><p>Teachers have effectively developed indoor and outdoor spaces that invite engagement. Children learn about nature through hands-on experiences. Adults frequently engage in sustained conversations with children. They notice and respond quickly to the moment of play when teaching and learning can occur. They use open-ended questions to encourage children to think more deeply, problem solve and investigate. Children are viewed as competent and capable learners.</p><p>Documents clearly illustrate teachers’ understanding and responses to significant moments of children’s play and learning. Children frequently assess their own learning. They take photographs of their work and choose creations to go into portfolios. Their learning is valued. Assessment supports the development of a strong identity in Māori and Pacific children through reflecting their cultural perspectives and their world.</p><p>Children are well supported by nurturing and caring adults. Routines are skilfully managed to offer choices. Group times provide opportunities for children to gather and engage in shared learning with peers and adults. They relate comfortably to one another, communicate and negotiate.</p><p>Celebrations are an important part of the curriculum. These events successfully enhance a strong sense of community ritual and festivity. Teachers value parent and whānau contribution to the programme. Parents comment positively about the curriculum and value the child-centred approach to teaching and learning. Children benefit from this partnership.</p><p>The bicultural perspective of Aotearoa New Zealand is positively reflected throughout the kindergarten. Appropriate resources, displays and use of te reo Māori, enable children to develop a positive understanding of their dual heritage. Teachers approach whānau and iwi, in person, for their contribution to celebrations of special significance, consult them about policies, philosophy and review.</p><p>Teachers work closely with the families of children identified as having specific needs. Their participation and progress is supported through collaboration between the kindergarten, home, external agencies and inclusive practice.</p><p>Self review is valued. Sound use of current best practice supports review processes. The staff appraisal process is improvement directed. Development goals focus on kindergarten and individual teacher needs and interests. Teachers receive feedback to affirm and reinforce shifts in practice.</p><p>A culture of honesty, trust, flexibility and respect exists among teachers. They are critically reflective practitioners who actively engage in professional learning and developments to extend practice. Teachers are advocates for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and leaders should enhance their evaluative capability to continue to strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and self review.</p><p>The association should continue to review appraisal. The use of observation of teaching practice and feedback processes should further improve teaching and learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frankleigh Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frankleigh Park Kindergarten will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>22 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
