</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Weymouth Playcentre is a parent-led cooperative that is licensed for 25 children, including 20 children up to two years of age. It offers three sessions each week. The centre operates in a well-resourced building near Weymouth Primary School. The families enrolled come from surrounding areas. The centre has a strategic goal to increase member numbers.</p><p>All centre families are new since the 2015 ERO review. The centre has developed clear roles and responsibilities to guide centre members' practices. The leadership role is shared by two centre coordinators. Centre members work with the centre support worker (CSW) and a centre administrator (CA) to manage day-to-day operations, administration and the curriculum.</p><p>The centre's philosophy reflects Playcentre aspirations of whƒÅnau and children learning together. The programme is guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted that children are confident learners. The programme and adults' collaborative responses supported children to learn through inclusive mixed-age play. These good quality practices continue to be evident. Areas for improvement included self review, assessment, programme planning and evaluation, and the meaningful use of the centre's strategic plan. Centre members have continued to work on their practices in these areas, and have made positive progress.</p><p>Playcentre Aotearoa is in the process of restructuring, moving from 32 Associations to six regional offices. The Auckland region includes 45 centres from the former Auckland, Tamaki and Counties Playcentre Associations. A regional manager oversees governance, management and administration and has a team of staff to support individual centres. Centre whƒÅnau and regional staff are in a period of transition. Regional staff are helping whƒÅnau as they adapt to new systems and responsibilities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six Playcentre reviews in the Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre families welcome, encourage and support new members as whƒÅnau and kaiako. Children are valued and respected as individuals and with their families, actively contribute to the programme. Children are keen explorers who test and develop their skills and confidence as they play and learn. They are able to move freely into the large outdoor area throughout sessions.</p><p>As a result of mixed-age groups, children have a strong sense of belonging and happily engage in activities for sustained periods. They converse enthusiastically with adults, who encourage their language development.</p><p>Good practices for infants and toddlers are well established, and well supported by quality resources that are easily accessed. Children are confident and independent, and trust that their whƒÅnau/kaiako are available to support them. They settle easily into the centre routines, and actively participate in them. Tuakana/teina relationships are a natural part of this centre.</p><p>WhƒÅnau/kaiako build relationships and cultural connections that support everyone to feel that they have a place. These whƒÅnau relationships help children to engage with learning and become confident and connected learners. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are valued and woven through the programme. Whanaungatanga and manaakitanga are strongly evident in the programme and interactions.</p><p>Children have opportunities to choose, lead their own learning, and make decisions about their play. They regularly interact with the variety of activities that promote literacy, mathematics, technology, and science. WhƒÅnau/kaiako have developed systems that capture and record children's learning and development. They use this information to further plan for children. They are now aware of the importance of having a variety of perspectives about each child's learning in their portfolio.</p><p>Centre members are developing their confidence in the use of internal evaluation. They recognise that this helps to improve learning opportunities and outcomes for tamariki.</p><p>Collaborative leadership provides opportunities for all centre members to extend and share their knowledge and skills. Newly appointed regional personnel are making progress building on existing systems and establishing regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements.</p><p>The regional management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the effective operation of individual centres. The team is aware of the unique strengths and needs of each centre and provides professional leadership to sustain improvement, growth and the focus on fostering positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members agree that their next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve the visibility and promotion of their commitment to te ao MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include children's and other adults' contributions in learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting more independence and self-management skills for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen internal evaluation in all areas of operations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve and strengthen practice the regional leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisit the commitment to Te Tiriti partnership, and to increase bicultural understandings and the integration of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori in centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarify and upskill centre support roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build regional office capability to embed new adult education programmes and qualifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the understanding and use of internal evaluation as a tool to guide practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop, evaluate and report against regional long-term and annual action plans that align with goals for improvement at national and regional levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the new Playcentre structure and systems and evaluate how effectively they support all children, including Pacific children and children with additional needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Weymouth Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Weymouth Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>29 August 2018</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
