</table><p>The service needs support to clarify the structure, roles and responsibilities at governance and management level. Such support is also needed to strengthen strategic planning, appraisal, aspects of relational trust, and the way routines and environments contribute to a full curriculum. The governing committee also needs to further consider how the sessional programme fits within the licence of Ark Early Childhood Centre and Ministry of Education requirements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ark Early Childhood Centre is part of the Holy Trinity Tauranga Ministries that provides governance and management for the centre. It is situated alongside the Anglican Church and provides all-day and sessional education and care for children from birth to school age. There are three age-based rooms in the centre and a sessional programme to support first time parents operating. At the time of this ERO review 122 children were enrolled, including 10 of Māori descent, and a number are from several different cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Through its philosophy the centre aims to provide 'Christian-based care and education showing acceptance of all people and where teachers and the curriculum reflect the belief that each child is a unique gift from God'.</p><p>Since ERO's 2014 review a new centre manager has been appointed. The <em>Supporting Parents Alongside Children's Education</em> (SPACE) sessional programme for first-time mothers and their babies, has been moved from the church complex into the Ark licenced premises and a new nursery for children up to 18 months opened at the beginning of 2017. ERO's previous review identified key next steps in relation to te reo and tikanga Māori, teaching practice, areas of play that extend children's learning, and strategic and annual planning. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager is providing strategic direction and well-informed leadership for the centre. A focus for the manager has been to address the key next steps identified in the last ERO report through a 3 year strategic plan. This plan needs to be strengthened through greater alignment between the church and centre's strategic and annual plans. It will be important to include specific actions and timeframes, and input from teachers, parents and whānau. The manager has also developed a useful framework for self review that is informing change. Under her leadership, teachers are engaging in self-review processes that are focused on improving learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Relationships between parents and teachers are welcoming, trusting and positive. There are many opportunities for parents to participate in the centre, sharing their skills and knowledge with children and teachers. Parents value conversations with teachers and informative displays that show children's interests and learning. These relationships contribute to children and their families' sense of belonging.</p><p>The Christian philosophy is highly evident within the curriculum. Teachers carefully plan and consider ways to make Christian ideals meaningful and relevant to children. Integral to the curriculum is Ako Aotearoa that aligns Christian and Māori values. The centre's response to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident in teachers' practice and the curriculum. Māori children's language and culture are affirmed and all children's spiritual wellbeing is nurtured.</p><p>Children enjoy opportunities to participate in a curriculum that is responsive to their emerging interests. Literacy and mathematic are naturally integrated in contexts that are meaningful for children. A feature of the programme are trips into the wider community and visitors to the centre that extend children's thinking and learning. To strengthen opportunities for children to engage in more complex play and exploration, consideration should now be given to ensuring routines and the organisation of learning environments do not compromise opportunities for children's learning.</p><p>Teachers regularly document each child's learning in individual portfolios. These documents record interests, dispositions and continuity of learning that build children's identity as learners. Continued development of assessment practice should include ways to capture parent voice and reflect the language, culture and identity of individual children and their families.</p><p>Transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well managed and responsive to individual children and their families. Careful consideration is given to settling children in a calm, unhurried way. The centre manager's recent involvement in the local Community of Learning | Kāhui Ako is likely to further support children's transition to school and seamless learning pathways.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from the small group size where individual care needs are effectively met. Further consideration is required in this area to improve the flow between indoor and outdoor areas and greater curriculum opportunities.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are warm and respectful. Children demonstrate trust in adults who foster independence and confidence. Teachers have developed a culture of inclusion where all children are valued, which is consistent with the centre's Christian philosophy.</p><p>The governance committee is currently experiencing challenges associated with restructuring of the service and the pending departure of the centre manager. The committee would benefit from external support to assist them to address key next steps and actions for compliance identified in this report.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Important priorities to assist the Ark Committee to move forward are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify roles and responsibilities for centre governance, management and leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>define the place and purpose of the sessional programme within the Ark philosophy and leadership structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' understanding of their professional accountability in relation to Education Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build relational trust and communication between governance committee, centre management and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen strategic direction by developing more specific actions and timeframes and with a greater emphasis on improving learning outcomes for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider the impact of adult-initiated routines and environmental limitations on children's access to a full curriculum, sustained and uninterrupted play.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ark Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements </p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to Education Council requirements, earthquake and fire safety and sessional curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fire exits are to be unlocked at all times the buildings are in use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fridge/freezers in the children's play space must be secured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system for regular appraisal is required and professional development must be provided for the registered teachers facilitating the sessional programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the sessional programme needs to be consistent with the expected curriculum standard : general</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the flow of play and exploration between the indoor and outdoor spaces for children in the new nursery area.</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS4, HS6, GMA7, Regulation 43, PS2])</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ark Early Childhood Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>26 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
