</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nursery and Kindy is one of two early childhood centres owned and operated by the Cardrona Alpine Resort. The alpine operation is currently in the process of a change of ownership.</p><p>The Nursery and Kindy mostly provides for children up to three years of age. It is licensed for 45¬†children, 15 up to age two and 30 children over two. Most of the children are enrolled short term. Some of the resort staff have enrolled their children at the centre. These children attend regularly. Some children also attend ski programmes provided on site. The centre is open seven days a week during the ski season to cater for the needs of New Zealand and overseas families on skiing holidays.</p><p>Most teachers are employed for just one season. Some are from abroad. The organisation provides induction and training at the start of each season for the new teaching team. An experienced centre supervisor provides continuity for the team.</p><p>Since the November 2009 ERO review, the centre‚Äôs name has changed from Kids‚Äô Korral to Nursery and Kindy. The centre was new at the time of the last review and received a positive report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families receive a warm welcome when they arrive at the centre. Teachers use effective strategies to build children‚Äôs sense of belonging and promote their wellbeing within a short period of time. They work well as a team to make sure that children are quickly integrated into the centre and have activities of interest that capture their attention and engage them in learning.</p><p>Children are respected and valued as individuals. Through skilful questioning, teachers quickly find out about children‚Äôs interests, ideas and preferences. They respond to these by organising activities and experiences across a range of curriculum areas. The programme offers children plenty of choice.</p><p>Where possible, teachers seek to acknowledge aspects of the children‚Äôs culture and language in their time at the centre. Teachers also take the opportunity to introduce children to the MƒÅori culture and aspects of New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. The centre is committed to continual development of its bicultural and multicultural practices.</p><p>Teachers effectively include and engage children in the programme. They actively support children to interact positively with each other. Children appeared very interested and involved in their play in a comfortable, well-resourced environment.</p><p>Children receive good quality care during their time at the centre. Teachers are sensitive and flexible to the children‚Äôs needs and the parents‚Äô wishes. Teachers are responsive to the very young children‚Äôs non-verbal cues and support them to settle into the programme at a calm and gentle pace. Parents are kept informed about their children.</p><p>Teachers seek to develop meaningful partnerships with parents in line with the organisation‚Äôs <em>all in this together</em> approach. Parents‚Äô feedback about their children‚Äôs experiences at the centre is very positive. Leaders and teachers respond appropriately to any suggestions for improvement.</p><p>Managers, leaders and teachers are focused on making ongoing improvements. They regularly reflect on their practice and make changes as a result. Teachers are increasingly taking responsibility for issues that arise in the programme. The changes they make have resulted in some positive outcomes for children and teachers.</p><p>Collegial relationships are evident between the resort service manager and the centre supervisor and team. The organisation has many systems and structures that support them to work cooperatively to improve children‚Äôs wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and leaders need to develop a strategic framework for the centre to:</p><ul>
<li>determine priorities that link to a shared vision, goals and philosophy</li>
<li>help monitor progress toward goals that are focused on positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Managers and teachers need to develop their understanding of self review to support their improvement focus. A more effective self-review process needs to include:</p><ul>
<li>a schedule for effective review of all operations over time</li>
<li>a more streamlined policy and procedural framework</li>
<li>ways to ensure better alignment between policy and practice</li>
<li>programme planning, delivery, assessment and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>It is particularly important in this mountain environment that managers and leaders carry out regular formal review of the effectiveness of policies, procedures and practices designed to support the safety of children at the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nursery &amp; Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nursery &amp; Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>7 October 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
