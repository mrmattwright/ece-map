</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wa Ora Montessori Preschool is attached to Wa Ora Montessori School in Naenae, Lower Hutt. It caters for 120 children from three to six years of age, in four mixed age classrooms. Of the 90 children enrolled, 10 are Māori.</p><p>The principal has the overall responsibility for the area school and preschool. The newly appointed deputy principal oversees all classrooms in the preschool. Each room is run by a head teacher with the support of a teacher.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered. The deputy principal and head teachers are Association Montessori Internationally (AMI) trained. Since the February 2014 ERO review there have been significant staffing changes at the senior leadership level.</p><p>The Montessori philosophy has a strong emphasis on providing a peaceful and orderly environment where children learn to work independently but within a wider community with differing ages and abilities.</p><p> The previous ERO report identified next steps for further development. These included the appraisal system and te ao Māori knowledge and understanding. The service has responded well to these areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is highly evident in practice. A clear vision sets direction for the service and reflects a commitment to high quality education for all children. A collaborative culture where children are at the centre of all decision making, has contributed to good practice being sustained through a time of significant leadership change.</p><p>Children learn in a calm, orderly and well-resourced environment.  They are able to move freely between the indoor and outdoor classrooms. This enables them to follow their interests, take risks and learn in their own way. They show confidence and competence as learners and are able to sustain their play for long periods. </p><p>The programme is based on the Montessori philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. High value is placed on the importance of authentic experiences and working with real and natural resources. Literacy, mathematics, science and caring for the environment are promoted through daily activities.</p><p>Ongoing assessment of children's knowledge, skills and understanding in relation to the philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em> informs individual planning. Teachers are intentional in the way they recognise and respond to opportunities to engage in, and extend children's learning.  They use a range of effective strategies to support children's independence, promote social competencies and problem solving skills. Parent and whānau aspirations are valued. They help inform goal setting and next learning priorities.</p><p>Individual learning stories help to build children's identities as successful learners, and show progress over time. Children's culture, language and identities are celebrated.  Stories are shared with parents through an online programme to provide further opportunity for them to contribute to their child's learning. Consideration should be given to how children are able to revisit their learning on a daily basis while at preschool.</p><p>Children's transition into the centre and on to school is supported by well-considered processes and good relationships. Collaboration and sharing of information with teachers in the primary school contributes to children's continued sense of belonging.</p><p>The service continues to focus on Māori children experiencing success as Māori.  Leaders and teachers are building their knowledge in this area committed to their own learning and actively seeking ways to integrate te reo me ngā tikanga Māori authentically across the curriculum.  Whānau Māori are increasingly contributing to decision-making. Teachers have identified that this continues to be an area for further development.</p><p>Teachers work with parents, whānau and external agencies to provide for children requiring additional learning support. They are strengthening their own knowledge and understanding of effective teaching strategies to promote children's engagement and success in learning.</p><p>The council has clear structures that guide how they monitor centre operation, management, and teaching and learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement-focused. The use of evidence-based review and evaluation to measure the impact of processes and practices on outcomes for children is developing. Strategic and annual planning outlines priorities across the preschool and area school contexts. Developing a differentiated annual plan to progress strategic goals, should enable the service to better monitor progress and evaluate the impact on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO leaders and teachers agree the service's priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen internal evaluation and annual planning to measure the impact of processes and practices on children's outcomes</li>
<li>continue to strengthen practices that promote Māori success as Māori. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wa Ora Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wa Ora Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>13 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
