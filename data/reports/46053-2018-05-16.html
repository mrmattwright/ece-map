</table><p>ERO has identified significant areas that require further development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing robust self-review systems and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing strategic planning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum development and delivery, particularly for older children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Adventures Katikati, formerly known as Beach Kids, is located in the township of Katikati. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 48 children including ten up to the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review, there were 45 children enrolled, a third of whom identify as MƒÅori. Separate learning areas provide for the needs of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy makes a commitment to providing a high-quality education and care programme for all children through a nurturing approach that promotes children to be confident and competent learners.</p><p>Since the ERO review in December 2014 the centre has been purchased by Evolve Group Ltd (Evolve). This organisation provides governance and management support. Evolve management review policies and guiding documentation to align with regulatory requirements and best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>A new area manager with oversight for a number of Evolve services was appointed in mid-2017. In addition there have been changes to leadership and teaching staff in the service. A professional teaching, learning and development team provides support for centre leaders nationally. Evolve also provides administrative support for the centre.</p><p>Teachers have responded to areas identified for development in the 2014 ERO report. Progress has included a review of assessment, planning and evaluation with a focus on individual children and a significant upgrade of the outdoor environment. There continues to be a need to improve self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Important aspects of the curriculum require strengthening to improve outcomes for children at the centre. Teachers and leaders agree that children need greater opportunities to make decisions and choices about their learning. Important next steps to strengthen the curriculum are;</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' planning to extend, add complexity and challenge to learning, particularly for older children, boys and active learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more frequent evaluation of the outcomes of planning and assessment to further inform teaching practice and resourcing decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The area manager and centre manager are working in a positive professional partnership to strengthen leadership capability across the centre. They recognise the need to consider ongoing centre-wide professional development to promote further engagement of children in meaningful learning.</p><p>The centre manager has been in her role for several years establishing a stable collaborative team of teachers. She has gained the respect and trust of the local community and knows children and their families well. Leaders and teachers are building on positive relationships with local MƒÅori.</p><p>The new governance structure has improved the clarity of expectations, set a clear direction for centre improvement and strengthened the professional support for the centre manager and head teachers. Evolve has provided increased professional support for centre leaders and teachers in recent times. There is ongoing review and renewal of policies and guiding documentation to more closely align with regulatory requirements and best practice in early childhood education. Leaders and teachers need to fully enact these policies, particularly in relation to health and safety, and curriculum. Consideration should be given to including a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand as part of the umbrella organisation's values statement.</p><p>The teaching team is collegial and collaborative. They support children's learning though positive guidance and respectful practices that affirm children as capable learners. Teachers plan for and undertake effective and supportive transitions between the age-based rooms. MƒÅori children are benefitting from teachers who are tangata whenua and have meaningful links with local hap≈´. Children are settled and confident. They demonstrate a positive sense of belonging and whanungatanga.</p><p>The programme is welcoming and inclusive. Teachers encourage parents and whƒÅnau participation and contribution to centre events and celebrations. Children, parents and their families are able to revisit and share their learning through individual portfolios, centre displays and online portfolios. Children with identified learning needs are included and well supported through appropriate support and guidance from outside agencies. Children are benefitting from familiar routines and positive relationships with teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The area manager and centre manager should give priority to;</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre philosophy and vision to reflect the aspirations of all stakeholders and honours MƒÅori as tangata whenua</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing formal opportunities for parents, families and teachers to meet and discuss priorities for children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the centre manager's knowledge and confidence to build professional practice across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing professional learning and development related to;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective management of centre finances</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing clear expectations for high quality teaching and learning in each aged-based room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and integrating <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017 and <em>TƒÅtaiako</em>, aligned to the centre philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Adventures Katikati completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing suitable appraisal for all staff that meets the requirements of the New Zealand Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing sufficient access to, and quantity and variety of equipment and materials appropriate for the learning and abilities of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing appropriate nappy changing facilities for up to two year olds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where food is provided by parents, the service encourages and promotes healthy eating guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that policies and centre procedures are followed, particularly with regard to administration of medication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving children greater access to a wider range of resources and equipment to enhance and extend their learning and development</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF4, PF8, PF25, HS19, HS28, GMA7, C9]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Adventures Katikati will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>16 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
