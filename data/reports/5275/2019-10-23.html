</table><p>Wairoa Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wairoa Kindergarten provides early childhood education and care for up to 43 children aged over two years. Of the 37 children currently enrolled, 24 are MƒÅori. All teachers are fully qualified. A new head teacher was appointed in November 2017.</p><p>The philosophy promotes natural creativity, place-based learning and aroha. It is currently under review.</p><p>The kindergarten is a member of the Enviroschools programme and of Mata Nui o Kahungunu KƒÅhui Ako.</p><p>Wairoa Kindergarten is one of 16 kindergartens operating under the governance and management of the Napier Kindergarten Association (the association). The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day operation of the association is the role of the general manager. Two education managers provide teaching and learning support for teachers. The board employs a Pou Whakarewa MƒÅtauranga (Professional Practice Advisor MƒÅori) to work alongside all association personnel to continue to strengthen cultural responsiveness.</p><p>The April 2016 ERO evaluation identified significant areas for development including provision of a responsive curriculum, assessment, planning and evaluation, appraisal and internal evaluation. These areas have been progressed well.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 kindergarten reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning through a curriculum that is based on their interests and highly reflective of their community. They are supported to explore their thinking about the world and often share what they know. Regular excursions give children meaningful opportunities to visit places of local significance. Children display a sense of self and belonging.</p><p>A holistic approach to teaching and learning effectively promotes children's wellbeing as a platform for further learning. Routines and strategies to support social competence are consistently implemented to foster children's sense of security.</p><p>MƒÅori children's identities are valued as the foundation for their educational success. Teachers acknowledge and make connections to individual children's pepeha. They are building understanding of kaupapa MƒÅori approaches to teaching and learning and make these visible within the curriculum.</p><p>Positive connections between teachers, parents and whƒÅnau encourage consistent approaches to children's learning between home and the kindergarten. Teachers make good use of community organisations to promote children's engagement and ongoing learning. Children with additional learning needs are well supported to participate in the programme. Teachers recognise that developing formal plans to monitor and evaluate progress towards these children's learning goals is a next step. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><p>Learning portfolios build a picture of children's strengths, interests and capabilities. Children treasure these books and use them often to revisit their learning. Teachers are exploring how individual planning and assessment can be further strengthened to support children's learning. Building consistent assessment practice that shows progress in learning and effectively gathering and responding to parent aspirations should be part of this process.</p><p>Leaders take a carefully considered approach to improvement. Since the previous ERO evaluation teachers have progressed their knowledge and use of internal evaluation. Strengthening the focus on how effective current practices are in promoting positive outcomes for children should enhance decision making for improvement. Education managers should continue to grow their own knowledge and practice of internal evaluation to better support this process.</p><p>The governing board is future-focused and has developed a clear strategic direction to meet the diverse needs of its communities. Board members value diversity of viewpoints and gather community and staff voice to inform decision-making. Regular reporting by the education managers is useful in identifying how strategic teaching and learning goals are being addressed.</p><p>The board places importance on developing teachers' capabilities. Targeted and deliberate building of cultural responsiveness supports MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau to experience success. An association-wide appraisal process is in place to support teacher practice in promoting positive learning outcomes for children. Further strengthening of the appraisal process, including targeted observations, should assist teachers to determine how well they are progressing and actively encourage them to improve their effectiveness.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that teachers at Wairoa Kindergarten should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the implementation and monitoring of plans to support children with additional learning needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to clearly progress learning of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to enhance decision making.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Education managers should continue to promote sustained improvement and innovation through strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluation, inquiry and professional guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Education managers should strengthen their understanding and use of internal evaluation to systematically evaluate their practices and the impact of these on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wairoa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that parents have given written approval of the proposed adult:child ratio for all excursions. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17]</em></p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>23 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
