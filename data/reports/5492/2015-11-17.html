</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Teachers have a strong focus on supporting children to be &lsquo;fit for learning&rsquo; at Concord Kindergarten. The philosophy is well considered and carefully designed. It is clearly evident in practice. Within the philosophy there are stated priorities for children&rsquo;s learning. These are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focus on numeracy and literacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>active movement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discovery.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten provides food, clothing and links with local support agencies to enable the above.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review a new head teacher has been appointed. She, along with the other teachers, form an experienced teaching team.</p><p>Teachers value and nurture parent and wh&#257;nau involvement in the kindergarten community. Many children who attend follow parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; connections with the kindergarten. An active parent committee raises funds for new equipment. Teachers provide opportunities for parents to meet socially through their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Many aspects of the 2012 ERO review recommendations have been worked on. Some continue to be work in progress.</p><p>Concord Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens operating under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). The kindergarten provides a mixed-age programme for children aged from two to five years from 8:30am to 2:30pm each day. This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the genuine partnerships between teachers and parents and the strong focus teachers and parents have on learning. Parents and wh&#257;nau are comfortable to stay and play alongside their children for sustained periods of time. They are encouraged to contribute to the daily programme and the long-term planning for their children.</p><p>Children play and learn in a safe and caring environment. Teachers deliberately work to develop trusting, caring relationships among children. Younger children are confident and are well supported within the programme. Children have developed close friendships. They play well together and alongside each other.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and needs.</p><p>Recently a useful system has been developed to gather parents&rsquo; ideas for their child&rsquo;s learning. This includes &lsquo;catch-up&rsquo; sheets and in-depth conversations with parents each term. Children&rsquo;s profile books show the richness of their experiences throughout their time at kindergarten. Documenting how teachers will further develop children&rsquo;s learning could be strengthened.</p><p>Well thought-out group plans show goals for children&rsquo;s learning and possible strategies and activities to achieve these. The planning is closely linked to the philosophy. Teachers make learning fun for children and skilfully interweave oral language, creativity, literacy and numeracy with developing social and physical skills. ERO observed a particularly strong focus on numeracy in all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Teachers provide carefully considered activities to support oral language development. Children take part in many small-group sessions, including songs, stories, puppetry and drama. Children benefit from a wide variety of authentic learning experiences, such as building on site, excursions and visitors.</p><p>M&#257;ori dimensions are interwoven throughout the daily programme. Matariki celebrations are important to this kindergarten and members of the community are invited to share their knowledge and skills at this time. These celebrations help strengthen the kindergarten&rsquo;s place in the community and expand teachers&rsquo; knowledge base.</p><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of self review. The association has provided them with a useful format to support self review. Positive changes have been made but this is an area for further development.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are responsive to the identified needs of children and families within the association, and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers&rsquo; understanding and implementation of self review has been identified by the senior teacher as an area for further development. ERO agrees with this.</p><p>Planning and assessing for individuals need to show in more detail how teachers are responding to parents&rsquo; aspirations. Records also need to consistently show continuity of learning, children&rsquo;s progress over time and the supporting role of teachers.</p><p>Currently the end-of-term group plan reflections are mainly descriptive. These would be more useful if teachers focused on evaluating the quality of teaching and learning rather than describing what happened.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manger and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association's vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent, high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Concord Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have&nbsp;taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Concord Kindergarten will be in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h4>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></p></html>
