<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Tokoroa Early Learning Centre caters for children in the town and surrounding areas. It operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Early Education Services Trust. Currently 53 children are attending, of whom 25 are identified as M&#257;ori and 5 as Cook Island.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, there have been changes of personnel. The centre manager took up her position in July 2011. Two teachers, one of whom was a team leader, resigned and new staff have been employed. Upgrades to the indoor areas, and to the playground for under two year olds, have contributed to improving the quality of the physical environment for children. Attractive displays of children&rsquo;s work and learning add to the welcome experienced by parents and children as they enter the centre.</p><p>Teachers are currently reviewing their philosophy, and preparing to share their ideas with parents. Professional development is beginning to add depth to teachers&rsquo; planning, assessment and self review.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eleven early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are benefitting from improvements to the centre environment. They are able to choose from a variety of appropriate equipment and learning opportunities, and can play individually or in small groups. Indoors, children are involved in a variety of creative and literacy activities, supported by books, structured equipment, and interesting print and visual displays. Teachers make children&rsquo;s learning visible and record learning stories that increasingly include children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; voices.</p><p>The centre receives equity funding that is used to improve the resources available for children, allow teachers to spend extra teaching time meeting higher learning needs for some children, and improving provisions for children&rsquo;s health and safety. The centre should consider consulting parents about the use of this funding, and reporting in more detail about the way it is spent.</p><p>Children under two are well settled and demonstrate a sense of identity and belonging. Teachers develop close relationships with parents and are working to include their aspirations for their children&rsquo;s growth and development. Responsive and respectful care-giving supports babies and toddlers to explore the environment, interact socially, and develop their oral and visual language. Children are encouraged to move between the under two and over two areas. Teachers of babies and toddlers demonstrate an understanding of the essence of the M&#257;ori child: mana, wairua and mauri.</p><p>The centre acknowledges M&#257;ori, Pacific and Indian cultures through celebrations, resources and activities for children and families. Teachers are increasingly using reflections as a tool to share and deepen their responsiveness to children. Some examples of sustained teaching interactions were observed.</p><p>The leadership team is working collaboratively to strengthen the links between the centre philosophy, teachers&rsquo; development goals and professional learning opportunities. In addition, the professional leaders have supported the centre manager in improving the physical, social and emotional environment for children and their families and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The centre manager and team leaders are working hard to establish shared understandings and consistent teaching practice among teachers. They implement and model effective teaching. They bring considerable knowledge, skills and experience to their roles.</p><p>The centre is managed and operated in line with Trust&rsquo;s policies and strategic priorities. The Trust&rsquo;s professional leaders work actively with the centre manager to build leadership and self-review capability, and to support the implementation of the new appraisal process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre is well placed to increase the consistency of teaching interactions through continuing professional development. Centre leaders and ERO agree that there is a need to:</p><ul>
<li>share and implement intentional, consistent teaching strategies in keeping with current good practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>strengthen planning processes for individuals, including diverse learners, and groups of children so that these processes are clear, effective and manageable</li>
<li>continue to evaluate the outcomes of their teaching practice and its influence on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tokoroa Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
