</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The February 2015 ERO report identified this service as Requiring Further Development. This review (2017) identifies the service as now Well Placed. However many of the improvements are recent and/or need further development. For this reason, ERO requires an action plan that describes how the centre will continue to strengthen its governance and management practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><p>This is a small privately owned service for children aged two years to school age. An adjacent centre provides education and care for infants/toddlers.</p><p>The owner has employed a person to act on his behalf as Service Provider (SP). This role involves strategic planning, overseeing finance and property, and acting in a liaison role. Since the last ERO review, the owner has made ongoing improvements to the indoor and outdoor environment.</p><p>The service has a long-serving centre manager and a new head teacher. All full-time staff are qualified early childhood teachers and most are fully registered.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report found that significant areas, especially at a governance and management level, needed development. This review (2017) found that progress had been made against almost all of the areas for development. However, improvements need to be embedded and extended. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported in their development, learning and wellbeing. Teachers are caring and affirming and know the children and their families well. Children settle quickly on arrival and know the centre routines. Teachers listen carefully to children, and use open-ended questions to encourage thinking and language development. There is a strong focus on early literacy and mathematics.</p><p>Children benefit from a range of engaging experiences and activities. They now have better opportunities to hear te reo Māori and experience aspects of Māori culture. This is the result of a useful review of existing practices and professional development. Centre leaders agree with ERO that they need to continue to strengthen this area.</p><p>Planning for individual children's learning has improved since the 2015 review. Children's 'Learning Journey' books include and respond to parents' wishes about their child's learning. Individual goals are regularly set and monitored. This review (2017) found that the quality of learning stories is still variable. Leaders need to review guidelines for planning, assessment and evaluation of group and individual learning. In particular, group plans need to make clearer the intended learning and related strategies that teachers will use to achieve this.</p><p>Governance and management practices show some improvement. A strategic plan to guide centre development is in place and there are better management systems, practices and documentation. However, many of these recent developments need further work and embedding. In particular, meetings need a stronger focus on how the service and teachers support children's learning. Job descriptions and centre plans need to be more specific. Progress reports need to be more evaluative.</p><p>The new SP is effectively keeping oversight of governance. The next step is to document meetings between the manager and SP. Similarly, the manager should provide regular and comprehensive reports to the SP about centre operations. Aspects of teachers' appraisal need further improvement.</p><p>Considerable work has been done to build shared understandings about centre priorities. Teachers have reviewed the centre philosophy so that it better reflects their beliefs about children's learning. Guidelines are in place to guide teachers in their work. Further work is needed to ensure that these guidelines reflect best practice and that staff regularly evaluate their practices against these and the centre philosophy.</p><p>The quality and depth of planned evaluations of centre practices have significantly improved. Leaders and teachers have a useful process to guide internal evaluation. They regularly seek parent perspectives. Recent evaluations have led to improvements in centre practices. The next steps are to ensure that leaders and teachers use evaluative questions to guide evaluation, to increase the frequency of spontaneous evaluation, and to develop a procedure to guide internal evaluation.</p><p>The new head teacher is modelling effective practice for her team and has played an important role in recent centre developments. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre needs to embed and extend its recent improvements. Next steps include strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>aspects of individual and group planning</li>
<li>te reo and te ao Māori</li>
<li>the quality of strategic, annual and other centre plans</li>
<li>documentation of meeting records and formal reporting within the centre (including to the SP and owner), guidelines/expectations for centre practices, teaching and learning</li>
<li>aspects of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO requests that the centre:</p><ul>
<li>develop an action plan that clearly describes how it will respond to ERO's recommendations</li>
<li>send six month and 12 month reports to ERO on its progress.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jade Star Young Children's Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action</h3><p>The appraisal of the centre manager has been inconsistent and/or not carried out. Her appraisal is underway this year. The owner must ensure that the manager is appraised in her management and teaching roles each year. (Licensing Criteria GMA 7.) </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jade Star Young Children's Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>9 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
