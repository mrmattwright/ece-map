</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puāwai Childcare Centre provides full-day care and education for children from birth to five years of age. It is located close to the Masterton central business district. It is licensed for 30 children, including 12 up to two years of age. Of the 37 children enrolled, 26 identify as Māori.</p><p>This service is influenced by kaupapa Māori. The philosophy stresses the importance of working in partnership with whānau so that children are inspired to build a strong sense of self and become confident learners. Kaupapa Māori concepts of whakawhanaungatanga, manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga are integral to curriculum decisions.</p><p>A manager/owner oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre and is supported by a supervisor and head teacher. A lead Māori educator is employed to support the development of a bicultural curriculum. Most teachers are qualified or in training.</p><p>The centre opened in April 2015. This is its first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is highly evident in practice. Te ao Māori me ngā tikanga is embedded in centre operations. Children benefit from a curriculum in which relationships are central to the programme. Whānau and children are warmly welcomed into the centre, nurturing a sense of belonging.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are well considered. They are flexible and based on the needs of the children and their whānau. Staff use a variety of strategies to support secure child, teacher and whānau relationships. As a result, these positive relationships enhance children's abilities to build confidence and a strong sense of security.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for strong and secure attachments. Teachers respect the connectedness between whānau, their children and the centre. They sensitively respond to individual children's routines and needs. A separate infant and toddler area gives these children their own space to explore. They have opportunities to learn from each other in a mixed age group setting.</p><p>Clear expectations for documenting children’s learning have been established by leaders and staff. Through genuine partnerships with whānau, meaningful connections are made between homes and the centre. Staff consistently evaluate the learning of children and respond to their emerging skills, interests and needs. Children are supported to develop a strong sense of themselves as confident learners within a variety of settings.</p><p>The culture, language and identity of Māori children is well promoted. Staff are strongly committed to providing a bi-cultural centre. Teachers incorporate the skills and expertise that whānau Māori bring to the service and the programme. Building stronger learning partnerships between whānau Māori and other parents is an ongoing focus. Strengthening these partnerships with Pacific families, should assist the centre to further develop its response to Pacific children.</p><p>Children with additional educational needs are well supported. Teachers liaise with whānau, and where appropriate, external agencies, to provide appropriate teaching and learning experiences.</p><p>Leaders and teachers actively network and access professional learning to inform their approach to supporting children's transition to school. Recently, staff have developed a useful individualised summary that describes the child and their learning for new entrant teachers. Leaders have identified that growing relationships with local schools is a continued focus for the centre.</p><p>Self review is appropriately linked to strategic priorities. Reviews are collaboratively undertaken with whānau and result in improved outcomes for children. Leaders agree that reviews are currently being used as research and development projects. Staff should now shift from reviewing what they do to evaluating the effectiveness of their practice. To achieve this within their current process they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use clear evaluative questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify measurable indicators of quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collect data directly linked to those indicators.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have worked to establish a positive team culture that is conducive to professional problem solving and critical reflection. Recent changes to the appraisal system have strengthened support for improved practice, which should in turn, impact on learning outcomes children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relationships with local schools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partnerships with Pacific families and community. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puāwai Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puāwai Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>13 July 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">.</a><a href="[sitetree_link,id=]"></a></span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
