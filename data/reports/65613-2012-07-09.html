<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1.The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Montessori House of Children is a privately owned early childhood service in Blenheim. Montessori philosophy and education principles are the foundation for the programme and the operation of the preschool. The philosophy clearly underpins the charter, the Montessori approach to teaching and learning and Te Wh&#257;riki, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>There is a calm and settled atmosphere throughout the centre which supports positive and affirming interactions. Children are confident and articulate. They are encouraged to explore their environment. They make independent choices and work, either individually or in small groups, for considerable periods of time. Children engage in sustained, concentrated and purposeful activity.</p>
<p>Teachers foster literacy and numeracy throughout the day. Children are provided with many opportunities to increase their skills and knowledge in these learning areas. Teachers integrate te reo M&#257;ori into the programme and their conversations with children. Curiosity is encouraged and supported. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s sense of discovery and exploration.</p>
<p>Parents and families are welcomed into the centre. Teachers encourage parents to actively participate in their child&rsquo;s learning and assessment. Profile books provide an attractive record of their child&rsquo;s progress and participation in the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers recognise and use opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s learning to ensure that that they are appropriately prepared for their transition to school.</p>
<p>Management and teachers should continue to strengthen self review, implement the newly planned appraisal process and build a consistent approach to the documentation and assessment of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Montessori House of Children - Blenheim was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMontessori House of Children - Blenheim.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Montessori House of Children operates from a thoughtfully converted house in Blenheim. Since the October 2008 ERO review, as a result of management&rsquo;s self review, the outdoor area has been undergoing a major upgrade to make the environment more inviting for children.</p>
<p>Some of the recommendations in the ERO October 2008 report have yet to be fully implemented.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>A high quality Montessori programme is provided for children. This philosophy is fully embedded in all aspects of the curriculum and the centre&rsquo;s operations. Teachers consistently encourage children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme and its range of activities. Children are carefully tracked against the Montessori record of learning and this information is shared with parents.</p>
<p>Literacy and numeracy are integral to the programme. Many opportunities are available for children to continue to develop their literacy and numeracy skills. A wide range of resources encourages children to participate in this aspect of the curriculum. Children were observed in sustained, concentrated and purposeful activity.</p>
<p>Interactions between and among children and staff are positive and friendly. A focus on the Montessori values of courtesy and respect assists with the smooth running of the day. Children work well together and share resources. They are familiar with routines, aware of teacher and peer expectations and confident in their interactions with others. Children display a strong sense of belonging and empowerment within the centre environment.</p>
<p>Children demonstrate independence and well-established self management skills. They participate in a free choice programme within a semi structured environment. They accept responsibility for keeping the indoor area neat and tidy and make good use of the high quality resources.</p>
<p>Curiosity is encouraged and supported. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s sense of discovery and exploration. They provide additional resources to supplement and extend play opportunities in response to children&rsquo;s questions and interests. The environment is well organised. Both the indoor and outdoor areas are attractive and spacious, and are inviting places for children. In the outdoors, a wide range of challenges provide children with opportunities to extend their physical skills.</p>
<p>Teachers integrate te reo M&#257;ori into the programme. Children understand and are confident to respond in te reo M&#257;ori as well as use it independently. This is an increasing strength within the centre.</p>
<p>Parents are provided with helpful and useful information about their child&rsquo;s progress. Narrative observation stories in profile books are a record, through the Montessori lens, of what their child is learning. Children have an active ownership of their profiles, often making decisions about what will be included. Teachers are looking at ways of encouraging parents to add further comment and stories to their child&rsquo;s profile book. There is some variability in the quality of the narratives.</p>
<p>The programme is well documented and an evaluative commentary provides ongoing guidance for teachers. Parents are welcome to stay and participate in the programme. There is a strong sense of community within the centre, supported by collegial, supportive and cooperative relationships among staff and the active involvement of families in the life of the centre.</p>
<h3>Development and review</h3>
<p>While there are clear links between the Montessori curriculum and programme how these are linked to outcomes for children and Te Wh&#257;riki is not documented.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Montessori House of Children - Blenheim completed a <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of this review ERO found that management had not implemented a robust performance management system that included an annual appraisal of teachers&rsquo; performance.</p>
<a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p>

<ul><li>teachers should continue to explore and build a consistent approach to the assessment of children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>a robust, annual appraisal process should be implemented for all staff.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<p>Montessori House of Children is a privately owned early childhood service in Blenheim. Montessori philosophy and education principles are the foundation for the programme and the operation of the preschool. The philosophy clearly underpins the charter, the Montessori approach to teaching and learning and Te Wh&#257;riki, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>There is a calm and settled atmosphere throughout the centre which supports positive and affirming interactions. Children are confident and articulate. They are encouraged to explore their environment. They make independent choices and work, either individually or in small groups, for considerable periods of time. Children engage in sustained, concentrated and purposeful activity.</p>
<p>Teachers foster literacy and numeracy throughout the day. Children are provided with many opportunities to increase their skills and knowledge in these learning areas. Teachers integrate te reo M&#257;ori into the programme and their conversations with children. Curiosity is encouraged and supported. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s sense of discovery and exploration.</p>
<p>Parents and families are welcomed into the centre. Teachers encourage parents to actively participate in their child&rsquo;s learning and assessment. Profile books provide an attractive record of their child&rsquo;s progress and participation in the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers recognise and use opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s learning to ensure that that they are appropriately prepared for their transition to school.</p>
<p>Management and teachers should continue to strengthen self review, implement the newly planned appraisal process and build a consistent approach to the documentation and assessment of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
