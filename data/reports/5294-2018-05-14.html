</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lucknow Kindergarten is in Havelock North. It opens Monday to Friday from 8:30am until 2:30pm for children aged from two to six years. Of the 40 children enrolled, eight children identify as Māori.</p><p>The April 2014 ERO report identified areas for improvement in relation to documentation of assessment, planning and evaluation, and self review.</p><p>Lucknow Kindergarten is one of 16 kindergartens governed and managed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). An ongoing programme of restructuring began in 2016 and the association has experienced significant changes at all levels. A new general manager was appointed in January 2016 and a new advisor - education delivery, in November 2017.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified that the association should establish, review and monitor the implementation of guiding documents in individual kindergartens and to undertake self review at association level.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Heretaunga Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kindergarten teachers have worked collaboratively to successfully address the areas for development and review identified in the previous ERO report.</p><p>The philosophy is highly evident. Parents and whānau regularly contribute to the programme. A sense of whanaungatanga underpins the service's operation. Responsive relationships successfully support children's sense of belonging.</p><p>A well-resourced environment reflects the vision and fosters open-ended exploration. Purposeful teaching supports children's developing language and early literacy skills. Science, mathematics and technologies are naturally integrated throughout the curriculum. Tuakana teina relationships empower children to take on leadership roles.</p><p>A continued focus on sustainable environmental practices is well embedded in the curriculum and supports children's understanding of te ao Maori concepts. Local pūrākau and the recognition of significance of local areas successfully contributes to the provision of a bicultural curriculum. Children revisit these stories through their daily play. Teachers are committed to improving their use of te reo Māori to further enhance children's learning.</p><p>A range of useful strategies promotes successful learning outcomes for Māori children. Effective learning partnerships are well established and teachers are responsive to whānau aspirations. Teachers continue to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of Pacific children's languages and culture.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning is highly effective. Ongoing observation of everyday activities builds a comprehensive picture of what children know, are interested in, and can do. Teachers effectively analyse assessment information. They work in partnership with parents to support children's learning pathways. Small whānau groups provide younger children with appropriate learning experiences. Children with additional learning needs are well supported.</p><p>A strong focus on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing systematic review is evident. Teachers make good use of a wide range of data to inform practice. Measuring the impact of changes on children's learning outcomes, should further strengthen this process.</p><p>The governance and leadership team of the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association are well placed to continue to manage ongoing change and to set the strategic direction to promote sustainability. They are making good progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the previous ERO review. Continuing to strengthen systems to monitor and evaluate progress in individual kindergartens remains a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Senior leaders and ERO agree that the key next step for teachers at Lucknow Kindergarten is to strengthen their evaluative capabilities with a focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>The senior management team of Heretaunga Kindergarten Association should continue to strengthen processes for monitoring the implementation of guiding documentation for programme delivery and kindergarten operations. Particular attention should be given to increasing consistency in reviewing, evaluating and improving teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lucknow Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the association should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure robust regular policy review and strengthen systems to promote teachers’ understanding and implementation of guiding policies</li>
<li>implement robust social media and online policies and procedures to ensure that all reasonable steps have been made to protect children's online safety and that parents are well informed of these.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lucknow Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>14 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
