<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Oaktree Kindergarten provides very good quality education and care for children from three to five years of age. The kindergarten offers three full-day programmes for children aged four to five years, and two half-day sessions each week for three to four year olds. A new teaching team has been appointed since the 2008 ERO review and is making positive changes for the future direction of the centre.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers are focused on building a learning community with parents and children. They are forming strong connections with families and value their input to centre developments. Staff promote an inclusive and welcoming environment and foster respectful and trusting relationships.</p>
<p align="left">Children are highly engaged in the programme. They play collaboratively with their friends and have many opportunities to explore and make choices from a richly resourced learning environment. They are confident and articulate and display a strong sense of belonging, ownership and community.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have high expectations of themselves as professional educators. They engage in regular training, are reflective about their practice, and make ongoing improvements to the programme. Teachers make skilful use of questions to promote children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning skills. They support children to explore the environment and develop their own learning.</p>
<p align="left">The head teacher is a strong professional leader. She values teachers&rsquo; strengths and skills and promotes a shared leadership approach. Teachers are using a good model for reviewing prioritised aspects of centre operations. ERO and teachers agree that teachers should continue to refine their self-review procedures to ensure continued improvements in their professional practice.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Oaktree Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atOaktree Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">In 2010 a new teaching team was appointed. As a result of the change from sessional to longer-day operation, the number of teachers increased from three to five. Two teachers are employed full time. Staff have focused on whole-centre review and have identified areas for improvement, including developing a shared understanding of the centre&rsquo;s teaching philosophy and improving the learning environment.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Positive environment for learning. Children and their parents/wh&#257;nau benefit from an inclusive and welcoming environment where teachers foster mutually respectful relationships. Children are confident and articulate and display a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Teachers are developing strong relationships with wh&#257;nau and value their input into centre developments. Parent feedback shows support for teachers&rsquo; vision of building a learning community with parents and children.</p>
<p align="left">Teaching practice. Teachers are highly skilled. They use open-ended questions to promote children&rsquo;s critical thinking and problem-solving skills. They support children to explore the environment and to develop their own learning. Other significant aspects of teachers&rsquo; practice include:</p>
<ul>
<li>integrating literacy within the context of children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>promoting ideas about environmental sustainability in children&rsquo;s daily lives</li>
<li>valuing children&rsquo;s previous learning experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Planning, assessment and evaluation. Teachers have engaged in training to further develop their planning and assessment strategies. They reflect on their professional practice and its impact on children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers value parents&rsquo; sharing of information about their children&rsquo;s home interests and experiences and use this information to enrich their planning.</p>
<p align="left">Leadership and team work. The head teacher is a strong professional leader. She values teachers&rsquo; strengths and skills and promotes a shared leadership approach. Together, teachers have developed a shared philosophy for teaching that is based on sound theoretical principles. Teachers benefit from North Auckland Kindergarten Association support as they continue to establish themselves as a team.</p>
<p align="left">Strategic direction and self review. Teachers value internal and external review and are using a good model for reviewing prioritised aspects of centre operations. They actively seek the contributions and opinions of parents/wh&#257;nau, children, and the Association professional adviser in the review process. This good practice is contributing to ongoing developments in the kindergarten.</p>
<h3>Area for development and review</h3>
<p align="left">Self-identified next steps. Teachers have identified a number of key next steps. ERO affirms these directions, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>using self review for continuous improvement</li>
<li>promoting the use of the environment to support children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>developing children&rsquo;s numeracy skills within the context of their play.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align="left">Over the past three years a number of children with moderate to severe special needs have been enrolled in Oaktree Kindergarten. The kindergarten environment is very well suited to accommodating children with special needs, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p align="left">Teachers promote an inclusive philosophy and practices. All children are provided with opportunities to participate in the high quality learning programme. Teachers value parents&rsquo; knowledge about their children. Teachers are readily available to parents to discuss their children&rsquo;s progress. Other aspects of good practice include teachers and parents working together to:</p>
<ul>
<li>personalise strategies to support children with special learning requirements when they enter the centre and when they make the transition to school</li>
<li>collaborate with external agencies to develop, review and refine individual learning plans</li>
<li>make decisions about best schooling options for children with special needs.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Oaktree Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p align="left">ERO, the centre managers and staff agree that teachers should continue to refine their self-review practices to ensure continued improvements in the operation of the kindergarten.</p>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-oaktree-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Oaktree Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Oaktree Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Oaktree Kindergarten provides very good quality education and care for children from three to five years of age. The kindergarten offers three full-day programmes for children aged four to five years, and two half-day sessions each week for three to four year olds. A new teaching team has been appointed since the 2008 ERO review and is making positive changes for the future direction of the centre.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers are focused on building a learning community with parents and children. They are forming strong connections with families and value their input to centre developments. Staff promote an inclusive and welcoming environment and foster respectful and trusting relationships.</p>
<p align="left">Children are highly engaged in the programme. They play collaboratively with their friends and have many opportunities to explore and make choices from a richly resourced learning environment. They are confident and articulate and display a strong sense of belonging, ownership and community.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have high expectations of themselves as professional educators. They engage in regular training, are reflective about their practice, and make ongoing improvements to the programme. Teachers make skilful use of questions to promote children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning skills. They support children to explore the environment and develop their own learning.</p>
<p align="left">The head teacher is a strong professional leader. She values teachers&rsquo; strengths and skills and promotes a shared leadership approach. Teachers are using a good model for reviewing prioritised aspects of centre operations. ERO and teachers agree that teachers should continue to refine their self-review procedures to ensure continued improvements in their professional practice.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
