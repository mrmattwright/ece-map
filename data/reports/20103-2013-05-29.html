<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Montessori at Herne Bay provides a full day pre-school service. It adopted a Montessori-based philosophy and approach to care and education in 2007. The philosophy has a strong focus on children developing their independence in a respectful environment. Children learn in two groups, with younger children moving to the older age group at about three years of age.</p><p>The centre operates under the management systems, policies and procedures of Kidicorp Limited. The centre manager oversees the day to-day-operations of the centre with the support of managers from Kidicorp Limited.</p><p>Several teachers have been with the centre for a number of years. There have also been a number of staff changes, including a change of centre manager, since the 2010 ERO review.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report acknowledged the parental support for the centre and the way in which the programme reflected the Montessori philosophy. The report suggested that teachers consider how the programme could better respond to children&rsquo;s interests. There remains further work to be done in this area and staff are receiving relevant professional development. Other professional development undertaken by staff relates to self review and leadership.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Respect is a core value that underpins teaching and learning practices at the centre. This value is very evident in interactions between teachers and children and among children themselves.</p><p>Children have opportunities to make their own decisions about how they spend their learning time. They choose their own activities, and teachers are flexible about ways that children use the centre&rsquo;s Montessori equipment. Teachers observe children and get involved to support their children&rsquo;s learning when appropriate.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. They encourage parents to take an active part in the centre programme. Children benefit from parents visiting the centre to share experiences and resources. Teachers invite parents to contribute to children&rsquo;s assessments and welcome their feedback on the way the centre operates.</p><p>Teachers are skilled in providing positive guidance for children and effectively foster the development of their social skills. Their expectations for children are clear and consistent. Teachers successfully support children to meet these expectations in ways that promote children&rsquo;s self belief, self-confidence, and self esteem.</p><p>The centre is appropriately resourced to promote Montessori approaches to learning. Resources are well organised and accessible. Children respect the equipment and follow teachers&rsquo; expectations that they will allow others to complete their work without disruption.</p><p>Staff plan strategically to promote centre improvements. A goal of the current strategic plan is to strengthen bicultural practices. This initiative is being well led by a teacher with support from managers and other staff.</p><p>Effective systems are in place to manage centre operations. Kidicorp Limited provides a sound policy base to guide operations. There are good systems to manage the performance of staff and to monitor health and safety matters.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers have identified the need to improve the outdoor area for the older children and plans to address this matter have been developed. Construction of a covered area between the indoor and outdoor areas for younger children could greatly enhance their environment by increasing the space available for play opportunities in all weather conditions.</p><p>ERO also suggests that managers work with teachers to document programme planning in ways that make stronger links with children&rsquo;s individual strengths and interests. Strengthening planning in this way will require a review of current assessment practices to ensure that teachers can manage the process in a timely fashion.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori at Herne Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>29 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.
