</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre in Manurewa provides full day early childhood education and care for up to 50 children. Families attending come from a diverse social and multicultural community. The centre was previously known as Discoveries on Boon St and changed name and ownership in October 2016. Together, the manager and owner manage this centre and The Treasure Cove ELC Russell Road.</p><p>The new owner has made major improvements to the centre's environment. Changes ensure a high level of compliance with requirements and prioritise children's health and safety. New landscaped outdoor play environments have been established. The interior has been totally renovated, including heat pumps in all areas. Resources that support the centre's focus on play-based learning have been significantly increased. New staff have been appointed and the team now includes five qualified teachers, teachers in training, a cook and regular relievers.</p><p>The three learning areas are Kakano for infants, Puawai for toddlers, and Poutama for older children. Each room has a senior teacher in a leadership role. Staff have a diverse range of cultural strengths and teaching experience. Teaching practices are based on current research and approaches to learning.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on freedom of play being the vehicle for learning. Children explore the wonder of their imagination through authentic experiences. <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, guides teacher practices and programme implementation.</p><p>This is the Manurewa centre's first ERO review as The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers implement a child-led programme that arises from children's interests, the centre‚Äôs philosophy and, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. The programme is underpinned by responsive relationships supported by a culture of mutual trust and respect for children and their whƒÅnau. Effective and inclusive teaching practices value and build on children's strengths. Children's diverse cultural backgrounds are affirmed and valued. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are included in meaningful ways throughout the day. Teachers know children and their families well. They ensure children‚Äôs transitions into the centre and on to school are responsive to individual children and whƒÅnau needs.</p><p>Children are confident, eager explorers and engaged learners. They capably engage in cooperative play for sustained periods of time. Children make discoveries in a calm, aesthetically pleasing environment that promotes curiosity and investigation. There is a strong focus on providing natural experiences and resources. This is supported by natural landscaping in the outside play area. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments and show a strong sense of ownership of and belonging in the centre. They have fun as they learn through play.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to use literacy, mathematics, science and technologies as part of their play and discussion. They are confident communicators who happily converse and share ideas with adults and their peers. Their language skills are very well supported and further developed by teachers. Children develop social competence and show care and concern for others. They play cooperatively for sustained periods, experience success and are eager to learn.</p><p>Teachers understand the special characteristics, and appreciate the capability, of infants and toddlers. They maintain a pleasant, nurturing environment where very young children benefit from individualised and respectful care. Hygiene practices are implemented sensitively, maintaining the young child's dignity and growing sense of self. Teachers provide well for toddlers‚Äô need for secure attachments and independence. They ensure they have space and time to try new things and revisit prior experiences at an unhurried pace. Children demonstrate a strong sense of attachment, familiarity and security in the centre.</p><p>Teachers value and actively support children's learning through play. Documentation shows children engaged in learning. There are clear connections between teachers' assessment, planning and evaluation. Assessment portfolios are rich records of individual children‚Äôs learning and reflect their strengths and cultural backgrounds. Increasingly, parents and whƒÅnau are reading and contributing to children‚Äôs portfolios. Parent/whƒÅnau feedback is encouraged and welcomed, as is their involvement in the centre.</p><p>The centre's vision and philosophy provide good guidance and support for centre governance and management. Internal evaluation is used to promote development across the centre through an increasingly collaborative evaluative process that is focused on outcomes for children. Building stronger links between the centre and the local community and iwi is a priority for centre leaders.</p><p>Teachers reflect on and identify ways to improve their practice and work effectively as a team. They are strong advocates for children and social justice and share a strong commitment to the centre philosophy. A sound appraisal process is in place that contributes to building teaching and leadership capability.</p><p>There is efficient recordkeeping, clear reporting and a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures. Self-review is child focused, purposeful and meaningful and used to inform improvements. The centre's philosophy is regularly reviewed and evident in teachers' practice. Clear strategic goals, which align to the centre vision statement, are outlined in annual plans.</p><p>Culturally responsive and socially aware professional leadership guides the centre goal of providing high quality early childhood education and care. Positive working relationships and collaboration between management and staff contribute to the centre culture of trust and respect. Performance management promotes quality practices and leadership opportunities. Teachers make good use of professional development opportunities to reflect on and enhance practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that next steps could include continuing to</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embed and sustain good practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop more collaborative and evaluative process of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support all staff to develop a shared understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foster more challenge and complexity in children's play.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
