</table><p>Rotorua Girls’ High School Childcare is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rotorua Girls’ High School Childcare is a stand alone, community-based centre and is licensed for up to 31 children from three months to school age. It operates under the governance and management of a trust comprised parent representatives, centre management and the principal of Rotorua Girls’ High School. The centre is located on the Rotorua Girls’ High School grounds and is adjacent to a local primary school. At the time of this ERO review 28 children were enrolled, 9 whakapapa to Te Arawa and a number of other iwi.</p><p>The trust expresses an educational commitment to developing individual children’s strengths and interests. Whakawhanaungatanga provides the foundation for the safe and caring mixed-age environment where Te Tiriti o Waitangi is honoured in all aspects of teaching and learning. Equitable partnerships at all levels are promoted to support a collaborative approach to ongoing learning that fosters sharing of knowledge and experiences.</p><p>The centre has a very positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2012 ERO review the centre has reviewed the strategic plan. Centre leadership has remained constant and teachers have engaged in research and professional learning and development about:</p><ul>
<li>supporting positive transitions for children</li>
<li>ensuring children have a strong sense of their own identity and culture.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A high priority for this community-based service is promoting and sustaining productive and collaborative relationships among trustees, teachers, children, parents, whānau and the wider community. Thoughtfully planned self review, using reflective questions informs decisions about the programme and changes to teaching practice. Spontaneous reviews are undertaken in response to specific events and incidents. These approaches to self review significantly enhance outcomes for children and families.</p><p>The supervisor and assistant supervisor provide well-informed and strong educational leadership for the centre. They are experienced and highly reflective early childhood teachers who lead by example, model 'best’ practice and effectively guide and support other teachers. A shared approach to centre leadership enables each teacher to contribute their strengths, talents and ideas. They work together from a basis of mutual understanding about high quality education and care for children of all ages.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum is well-designed and implemented to promote positive learning outcomes for all children within the mixed-age setting. The curriculum effectively supports children's:</p><ul>
<li>love of, and confidence to initiate and lead their own learning</li>
<li>positive sense of identity and opportunities to learn in the context of their culture</li>
<li>active engagement in rich experiences in an environment that provokes wonder, curiosity and endless opportunities</li>
<li>physical and emotional wellbeing, and confidence, in a culture of mutual respect and relational trust</li>
<li>interactions where younger and older children play and learn alongside one another, developing friendships and supporting one another’s achievements.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are redeveloping their approach to assessment using Te Whatu Pōkeka, to better support the cultural identity of Māori children and in turn benefit all children. Through this development teachers need to consider how to document the complexity and continuity of children’s learning and grow parents’ understanding of Te Whatu Pōkeka.</p><p>A significant feature of teachers’ practice is the successful implementation of the ‘<em>Key Teacher’</em> role in advocating for the child. Through this approach intimate relationships and partnerships are built between children, their parents, whānau and teachers. Teachers have in-depth knowledge of each child’s personal rhythms, timely responses to individuals which contribute to the calm, settled and low-stress centre environment.</p><p>Teachers understand and value children’s play and exploration as meaningful learning. They are skilled at recognising and responding to children’s interests, respect their ideas and foster learning partnerships. Teachers promote concepts about health, wellbeing and caring for the environment through role modelling and engagement in authentic learning opportunities alongside children. In addition, children benefit from the language rich and well-resourced environment where they are encouraged to confidently express their feelings and opinions, and explore aspects of literacy, mathematics, science and digital technology.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The trust has begun to review the services vision and strategic direction in consultation with teachers, parents and whānau. This review is timely for the centre and affords the opportunity to also review the centre philosophy. It will be important to reflect current approaches to teaching practice and curriculum development, the unique features of the service, and align these to the service’s strategic direction. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the teachers and management of Rotorua Girls’ High School Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Rotorua Girls’ High School Childcare Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 June 2015 </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/" target="_blank">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
