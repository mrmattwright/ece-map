</table><p>Cambridge Road Community Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cambridge Road Community Kindergarten is located inside the grounds of Hillcrest Normal School in Hamilton. The centre provides education and care for children from two years to school age. Licensed for 20 children, it operates from 8:30am to 3:15pm during the school terms. The roll reflects a significant number of different cultures.</p><p>The community-based centre is governed as an incorporated society. The elected parent committee also includes the head teacher (also the licensee) and teachers. Since the 2016 ERO review, one of the teachers has been appointed to the head teacher role and two new teachers have been appointed. All teachers are qualified early childhood educators.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states that they offer a small, friendly engaging learning environment for children and their whƒÅnau. They are driven to provide high-quality early childhood education underpinned by: tamariki whakamana - nurturing the mana and learning of children, ako - teaching and learning, whanaungatanga - relationships, MƒÅoritanga - bicultural commitment and MƒÅori ways of being, and kaitiakitanga - guardianship.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to the areas identified for development in the 2016 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing in the centre. Teachers are skilled at noticing children's interests and extending their learning in meaningful contexts. They know each child and their whƒÅnau well and relationships are based on trust and respect. Children are supported and encouraged to be self managing and to develop positive relationships.</p><p>There is an inclusive and relational approach to supporting children with additional learning needs and their families, including involvement with specialised agencies. The collaborative approach ensures these children can fully participate in the programme through individualised planning. Transitions to school, including school visits are personalised and sensitive to the needs of the children.</p><p>The service philosophy expresses its community aspiration for the children. The principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are strongly evident in the localised and authentic learning programme. Regular excursions into the local natural environment extends learning opportunities. Children are creative and actively explore the well-considered resources, activities and experiences. Languages, cultures and identities are strongly reflected and celebrated in learning portfolios and in practice. Individual assessment portfolios provide a rich record of progress of children over time and reflect a learning partnership with whƒÅnau. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Leadership has identified and values the strengths of the teaching team to contribute to positive outcomes. Children and their whƒÅnau are at the centre of all decision making. Leadership and a growing collaborative team culture is highly focused on improving outcomes for children. Useful frameworks for internal evaluation support ongoing centre improvement. Children experience teaching and learning opportunities that are well informed and incorporate recognised current practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Governance and management are effective in supporting high-quality education and care for children. There is a collaborative and inclusive approach to governing the centre. They are well informed by leaders. A strong focus on continual improvement underpins the shared decision-making processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and leaders need to continue to make clear, the alignment of the strategic plan to outcomes for children. This is should enhance and deepen internal evaluation to sustain and continually improve teaching and learning for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cambridge Road Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie <br>Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Central Region</p><p>8 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
