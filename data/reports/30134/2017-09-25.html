</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Morgan Educare Centre Ltd is one of two family owned and operated early childhood centres in the suburb of Flaxmere, Hastings.¬† It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 29 children, including 9 up to the age of 2.¬† Of the 31 children currently enrolled 22 identify as MƒÅori and 8 as Pacific.</p><p>A van transports children to and from the centre. Lunch is provided for children four days a week.</p><p>Two service directors are responsible for governance, and support the centre managers in their role.¬† The centre manager ensures centre philosophy is upheld and undertakes staff development.¬† Curriculum delivery and day-to-day management of the centre are the responsibility of the supervisor. Most staff are fully qualified.</p><p>Since the last ERO visit in 2014 the centre has reviewed its philosophy. The service philosophy focuses on sustainability and making connections to PapatuƒÅnuku and the local community. Relationships with parents, whƒÅnau and the wider community are valued in the service.</p><p>Significant progress has been made to address the key next steps outlined in August 2014 ERO report. These included: improvements to the environment, resources and aspects of teaching and learning practice to improve the curriculum.</p><p>This review was one of two in the Morgan Educare Centre group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong relationships are formed with whƒÅnau. Many parents regularly attend centre events and contribute to group projects within the service. Children experience regular excursions into the community which allows them to participate in a programme which supports sustainability and care of the local environment.</p><p>Children access a wide range of resources and experiences that connect them to their own and other cultures. Te reo MƒÅori me ngƒÅ tikanga are naturally integrated into daily practices. The environment reflects local stories and community input into the programme. A kaumatua supports children to learn songs and stories from the area.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are committed to developing practice that supports MƒÅori children‚Äôs educational success. The expertise of whƒÅnau MƒÅori and what they bring to the service is valued. Teachers are respectful of children's iwi connections and the implications this has for supporting their individual success. Building stronger learning partnerships between whƒÅnau MƒÅori continues to be a focus.</p><p>Reciprocal relationships with Pacific families are evident. Management and staff are continuing to develop their understanding of the different Pacific cultures and identities of the children who attend.</p><p>Transitions into and out of the service are responsive to the needs of the children and their families. Teachers actively support children and their families to transition to school. Useful relationships with several local primary schools have been established.</p><p>Positive, responsive interactions with infants and toddlers support children's growing sense of belonging. A separate infant and toddler area gives these children their own space to explore. Consistent caregiving enables teachers to respond sensitively to individual needs and preferences. Children are developing warm and trusting relationships.</p><p>Clear expectations for documenting infant and toddler's learning have been established. Parents share their aspirations for their children's learning. Each child has a portfolio which demonstrates their participation in the curriculum. Their interests, dispositions and the development of new skills and learning over time are documented.</p><p>The group planning approach for older children promotes the values of the centre philosophy. Information from individual and group interests is used to plan for teacher-led projects. The service utilises different strategies to collect whƒÅnau voice. Strengthening the consistency of assessment and planning is necessary to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly identify the learning that takes place and the extension of this over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and evaluate intentional teaching to support children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better reflect the culture, language and identity of individuals and the response to their parents' aspirations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children with additional learning needs are effectively supported. Teachers, parents and external agencies share information to promote positive outcomes for children requiring additional support. Strategies are well considered to enable their inclusion within the programme.</p><p>The centre has a well-established process for self review which is responsive to identified priorities. It informs decision making and is used to improve outcomes for children. Shifting the reviews from focusing on what they are doing, to evaluating how well teaching and learning practices strengthen outcomes for children, is a next step.¬†</p><p>Extensive policies and procedures underpin the operation of the centre. Leaders agree with ERO's findings that a key next step is to evaluate how well these provide:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarity and direction for staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustainability for ongoing operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a focussed approach for valued outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are well supported by the centre manager to grow practice. Annual appraisal supports the development of teachers' practice. Clear expectations for teachers' practice are evident. Teachers' reflections show an understanding of their practice and outcomes for children. Management agrees that a more streamlined and integrated approach to the collection of evidence continues to be an ongoing focus.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to develop and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the consistency of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' understanding of effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Management should continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a streamlined system that supports the strategic vision and sustainable practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Morgan Educare Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Morgan Educare Centre Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>25 September 2017</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
