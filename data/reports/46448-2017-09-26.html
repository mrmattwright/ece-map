</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jumpstart School is one of three locally owned and operated private early childhood education and care services operating under the Jumpstart umbrella, in New Plymouth. The centre is licensed for 45 children aged over two years. Of the 44 children enrolled, 13 are MƒÅori.</p><p>The Jumpstart managing director supports the centre leaders (principals) and administrator in the day to day operation and ensures the strategic priorities are progressed. She works closely with and provides ongoing professional support to the principal and teachers to deliver high quality education and care.</p><p>Learning through play, respectful relationships and promoting children's development as confident, capable learners who are self managing and socially competent is emphasised. The philosophy is currently being reviewed by the team.</p><p>This is the centre's first ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in Jumpstart preschools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs interactions are positive, respectful, and unhurried. Teachers implement a range of practices that promote learning. Children are responsive to their peers and collaborate well with each other.</p><p>A wide range of high quality resources invites children's investigation and participation. The indoor and outdoor areas encourage involvement in a range of experiences, exploration, challenge and engagement with aspects of the natural environment.</p><p>Children actively engage in their learning experiences. Their social competencies, independence and self-management are well supported. They demonstrate perseverance through their play.</p><p>Commitment to <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> is evident. Te ao MƒÅori values and beliefs are reflected through interactions, the environment and within the learning programme. Children show confidence in using te reo MƒÅori. Leaders are focused on continuing to strengthen practices that contribute to success for MƒÅori.</p><p>Parent aspirations and children's interests inform and guide the curriculum. It is consistent with the intended learning outcomes of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum). Experiences include a focus on literacy, mathematics, science and creativity.</p><p>An individualised assessment approach and focus on development of children's specific learning dispositions has been developed. Continuing to make links between planning, assessment and evaluation processes is a next step for teachers.</p><p>An online programme that illustrates and celebrates individual learning has been successfully introduced. It includes recognition of progress over time and two-way communication between parents, whƒÅnau and teachers. 'My Learning Journey' reports and associated parent conferences provide a further opportunity for parents and teachers to share children's learning.</p><p>Recent self-review has resulted in a well-considered transition process that supports children and their families into the centre and on to schools. This includes providing a range of information, visits and the sharing of learning records.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. Building a team approach to promote positive outcomes for children is an emphasis. Regular meetings to share ideas about effective teaching, learning and care practices helps to develop consistency and improve capability.</p><p>Centre-wide professional learning positively contributes to the development of curriculum to promote positive outcomes for children. The organisation has a comprehensive appraisal process that supports improvement for teachers and leaders. An important next step is to ensure that the organisations' appraisal requirements are carried out and completed.</p><p>Internal evaluation, ongoing inquiry and planning evaluations provide insight into the effectiveness of teaching practices. The centre leader is developing collaborative review processes that lead to positive change and improvement. Professional learning is building evaluative capacity. A next step to continue developing this process is through deeper analysis and sense-making of evidence collected within evaluations.</p><p>Management and leadership support centre operation and build capability to promote positive outcomes for children. Quality assurance and well-developed communication processes foster leadership, teaching and awareness of service and legislative expectations to build consistent practices.</p><p>Strategic goals are developed by the managing director in consultation with the centre leaders. These are influenced by parent, whƒÅnau, community and teacher input. Parent and staff surveys affirm practices and identify possible areas for further strengthening.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to build shared understanding of the purpose and use of assessment and planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen aspects of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further support teachers to fully implement the organisations' appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jumpstart School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jumpstart School will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>26 September 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
