<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>

<p>Poipoi Home Child Care Limited is one of four home-based education and care networks operating as part of Poipoi Home Child Care Limited. The service provides for children up to six years of age in Far North communities including Omapere, Kaitaia, Paparore, Cable Bay and south to Kaeo.</p>
<p>This is the first ERO review of the four Poipoi networks. The service has experienced significant growth since it was established in 2009.</p>
<p>This report identifies some areas of good performance. Children's wellbeing and belonging are well supported and they benefit from caring relationships with educators. Good communication practices are resulting in trusting relationships between wh&#257;nau and the service. The service's philosophy is well enacted and a kaupapa M&#257;ori approach to service management is evident.</p>
<p>However, ERO's evaluation also identified a significant number of development areas needed to improve service management and the quality of education and care provided for children. Addressing these and the areas of non-compliance detailed in this report must be a priority for the service owner.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO intends to return to the service within 12 months to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p>
<a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. The Focus of the Review</h2>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Educators work in their own homes to provide education and care for up to four children at any one time. Most of the children enrolled in this network have M&#257;ori heritage and whakapapa to the five iwi of Muriwhenua. Children and educators speak both M&#257;ori and English during the day. A team of four visiting teachers, who are qualified and registered early childhood teachers, visits homes and supports educators to plan and provide educational programmes for children. The owner is responsible for the overall governance of the service.</p>
<p>A central part of the service&rsquo;s philosophy is &ldquo;to cherish and protect what is special about each child&rdquo;. A commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and a respect for Te Ao M&#257;ori underpin the service&rsquo;s approach to home-based education and care. The owner and visiting teachers work closely with social agencies to support and advocate for children and wh&#257;nau. Educators are encouraged to participate in Playcentre adult education courses and other learning opportunities.</p>
<h3>Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children experience home settings where te reo me &#333;na tikanga M&#257;ori are valued. Their wellbeing and belonging are supported by a strong sense of aroha and whanaungatanga. Children benefit from caring relationships with educators who know them well. They are encouraged to explore the natural world and make choices as they play. The small group size supports infants and toddlers to settle into the home setting. Children with special and high needs are warmly welcomed and included.</p>
<p>Good communication with wh&#257;nau is a priority for the service. The owner and visiting teachers have developed trusting relationships with wh&#257;nau, tamariki and educators. They recognise that many families value face-to-face conversations as a way to share information and their aspirations for their children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Educators are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. They have a range of skills and experiences that guide their work with children. Educators are encouraged to participate in training to build their knowledge of how young children learn. Where educators have higher qualifications and training levels, children&rsquo;s interests are extended and their learning over time is well supported.</p>
<p>Visiting teachers work well together to enact the service&rsquo;s philosophy. They collaborate and share ideas that will promote children&rsquo;s learning. Visiting teachers develop inclusive relationships with children and educators. They are enthusiastic about making the improvements identified in this report.</p>
<p>The overall management of the service is clearly linked to a kaupapa M&#257;ori approach. A range of policies and operational procedures guide service delivery. A purposeful self-review process has been established. The owner has proactively addressed funding issues that have arisen from some children attending two services at the same time. In addition, she recognises that she could more clearly document concerns and complaints, and subsequent actions taken.</p>
<h3>Key next steps</h3>
<p>The service owner agrees that key next steps to improve the quality of management include:</p>
<ul><li>developing and implementing systems to assure the owner that hazard management and health and safety in homes are being monitored</li>
<li>developing and evaluating long term and annual goals to guide ongoing improvement</li>
<li>increasing wh&#257;nau and educator participation in self review</li>
<li>seeking professional development for visiting teachers to support them in their leadership and adult education roles</li>
<li>linking appraisal processes for qualified teachers to the Registered Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><p>The service owner also agrees that key next steps for visiting teachers include:</p>
<ul><li>supporting educators to plan for individual children&rsquo;s learning, rather than simply planning activities</li>
<li>guiding educators to document how programmes celebrate the language, culture and identity of tamariki M&#257;ori</li>
<li>monitoring the extent to which children&rsquo;s individual records show their participation in home-based programmes, as well as community events</li>
<li>documenting their conversations with wh&#257;nau and using this information to help them plan for children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Visiting teachers should ensure they regularly document how they coach to improve educator practice. They should also record their contribution to the assessment, planning and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning, at least monthly.</p>
<h3>3. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h3>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management and staff of Poipoi Home Child Care Limited completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance to be addressed. The service owner must ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>systems for monitoring hazards, health and safety procedures and other legal requirements in homes are maintained</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 46 (1a)</em></p>
<ul><li>programmes provided for children are informed by well-documented planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2</em></p>
<ul><li>non-registered staff and other adults aged over 17 in homes, are police vetted every three years</li>
</ul><p><em>Education Amendment Act, 2010, 319FB</em></p>
<ul><li>fewer than five children are provided for in a home at any one time</li>
</ul><p><em>Education Act, 1989, s309</em></p>
<ul><li>hygienic hand-washing facilities are available for children</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF16</em></p>
<ul><li>the use of equity funding is reported to parents</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA2</em>.</p>
<a id="4-recommendations-to-other-agencies" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations to other agencies</h2>
<p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education provide support to the service owner and visiting teachers to ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>management and quality assurance systems support the effective operation of the service</li>
<li>visiting teachers record how they guide improved educator practices and contribute to curriculum provision in homes.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO intends to return to the service within 12 months to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p>
