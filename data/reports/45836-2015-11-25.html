</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Island Bay Childcare is a privately-owned centre. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 56 children, including 21 up to the age of two years. Of the 71 enrolled, one child identifies as MƒÅori. The centre is purpose built with separate playrooms for infants and toddlers and the older children.</p><p>The leadership team comprises of the centre manager, two team leaders and an external consultant. Some staffing changes have occurred since ERO's October 2013 review.</p><p>The October 2013 ERO report identified that significant improvement was needed, particularly in relation to developing shared expectations of effective early childhood teaching and learning. Key next steps included: improving the quality of teaching and respectful interactions; responding to children‚Äôs culture, language and identity; strengthening the appraisal process; and reviewing the transition to school programme.</p><p>Leaders, with regular Ministry of Education monitoring, have worked with centre staff to address the areas in need of improvement. A wide range of professional development has been accessed to address these areas of concern.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and the teaching team have made good progress in developing shared expectations for high quality early childhood practice. They have participated in a range of professional learning and development to further their understanding of teaching and learning, children‚Äôs culture, language and identity and the appraisal process.</p><p>The philosophy promotes a child-centred focus in the curriculum, partnerships with parents and respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This approach is evident in practice. Leaders have developed indicators that make clear the quality teaching practices that enable the philosophy to be realised. Further work is required to include a stronger focus on the role of the teacher in adding complexity to children‚Äôs learning. This would strengthen these indicators.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They are warm and welcoming to them and their families. They work alongside children, engaging in their conversations and offering choices in their learning and help children relate to others in positive ways. Although some progress is evident in the quality of interactions teachers use with children, continued development is required. A key next step for leaders, in partnership with teachers, is to define what quality interactions are, so that expectations for practice are clear. These can then be used more successfully to target observations of teachers' practice for appraisal and self review.</p><p>Leaders have been responsive to building bicultural practice in the centre. A bicultural perspective is evident through the environment and aspects of the curriculum. Teachers integrate te reo me ngƒÅ tikƒÅnga MƒÅori throughout the programme. <em>Tataiako</em>: <em>Cultural competences for teachers of MƒÅori learners</em> has been explored in-depth in relation to teachers‚Äô professional practice. Children‚Äôs culture, language and identity is affirmed and celebrated through the centre curriculum and assessment information.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profiles highlight their involvement in centre activities. Partnership with parents is actively promoted through regular communication and involvement in their child‚Äôs programme. Assessment documentation requires development to clearly identify the learning and show how teachers add complexity, extend learning and show progress over time.</p><p>Group planning provides a shared focus for the programme. Clearer learning outcomes should assist teachers to evaluate the impact of the curriculum on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Self review and internal evaluation have resulted in improvements to practice. A clear and well-analysed process is in place. To strengthen internal evaluation capability, leaders should support teachers to shift from reviewing what they do, to evaluating how well practices support children's learning.</p><p>Transition to school has been a recent self-review focus. Leaders and teachers reflected on current research and have sought multiple perspectives through this process. Improvements have been made to practice to better support children's preparation for school.</p><p>Regular appraisals are undertaken. Although some progress is evident, further work is required to strengthen the quality of the documentation. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing a clear appraisal procedure</li>
<li>use of formal observations to inform professional practice conversations</li>
<li>teachers identifying clear, specific and measurable goals</li>
<li>reflecting the additional responsibilities of the designated role through the appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and leaders should continue to focus on strengthening practice to improve outcomes for children. Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>identifying the role of the teacher in adding complexity to children‚Äôs learning and reflect this through the philosophy</li>
<li>making explicit centre expectations regarding quality interactions between teachers and children</li>
<li>strengthening the analysis of children‚Äôs learning and planning accordingly</li>
<li>building the evaluation capacity of teachers</li>
<li>establishing a clear appraisal procedure and improving documentation of the process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Island Bay Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Island Bay Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>25 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
