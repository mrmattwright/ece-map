</table><p>The association is well placed to support the kindergarten‚Äôs key developmental needs.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lakeview Kindergarten is located in Waipukurau. It andhas a teaching staff of four teachersthree are employed on a long term relieving basis. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children and at the time of this review, 64 children were enrolled.</p><p>Major changess to the playground and storage areas have occurred. The kindergarten is involved in the Envirochools sustainability initiative and this has assisted in the resource planning for the outdoor area.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two Education Managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The vision is evident in practice and aspects of the philosophy are apparent. The head teacher strongly advocates for all children.</p><p>Children enjoy being together and are confident to express themselves in the child-led, play-based programme. They engage in play for sustained periods. At times, some teachers follow children‚Äôs interests and ask open-ended questions.</p><p>Teachers should be intentional in the strategies they use to challenge and engage children in higher order thinking. Children‚Äôs independence is not effectively fostered and at times they are not viewed as capable and confident learners. Teachers should promote problem solving to assist in building children‚Äôs exploration and social competence.</p><p>Entries in children‚Äôs profiles reflect their interests, involvement in the programme and relationships. Recent developments in assessment help to build children‚Äôs identity as a successful learner. These narratives provide an insight into children‚Äôs emerging interests. To strengthen assessment practices teachers should show how they extend and deepen children‚Äôs learning, based on their interests, and reflect children‚Äôs progress over time.</p><p>Teachers have identified what success for Maori looks like and that this area is a key next step to work towards. By including children‚Äôs cultures in profiles, entries will better reflect children and their families and whnau.</p><p>The teaching team also acknowledge the need to strengthen the bicultural programme. They are participating in the Haere Whakamua professional development project introduced to increase teachers‚Äô capabilities in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. This project is about progressing the organisation‚Äôs journey in biculturalism. ERO‚Äôs evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Planning to inform the programme is an ongoing area for development and there is a need for teachers to strengthen and deepen their understanding of the self-review process and build their evaluative capability.</p><p>Relationships with parents are valued. Teachers should regularly collect, respond to and revisit parent and whƒÅnau aspirations, using the information to strengthen practice and the responsiveness of the programme.</p><p>Teachers work in partnership with parents and whanau of children with additional learning needs to improve and enhance their learning. Support is monitored by teachers and reflected in assessment entries. Effective partnerships between families, the kindergarten and schools support successful transistions.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear long term direction for the association. Teachers are supported through regular visits from the education managers who provide professional support and guidance and access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>The association identifies and ERO affirms that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>updating the appraisal process and policy</li>
<li>providing clear expectations through guiding documents for programme delivery and kindergarten operations and monitoring implementation</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers and use this information to inform future decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Appropriate next steps for teachers are:</p><ul>
<li>to strengthen bicultural practice and strategies to support success for Maori as Maori.</li>
<li>to show how they deepen and increase complexity of children‚Äôs learning and progress over time</li>
<li>to be more intentional in the use of strategies to challenge and engage children in high order thinking</li>
<li>to strengthen and deepen their understanding of the self review and build evaluative capability</li>
<li>to regularly collect, respond to and revisit parent and whanau aspirations to inform practice and the programme</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>support the head teacher to assist all teachers further develop the quality of teaching.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lakeview Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lakeview Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>14 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
