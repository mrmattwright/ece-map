<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Northcote Pre-School is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Northcote Pre-School Community Trust (Kete Wananga) provides an all day and sessional early childhood education service for children aged from two to five years. It provides for a diverse group of children from the surrounding multicultural community and many have English as an additional language. The centre operates from a community hall in Northcote that is owned by the local council. The establishment of a Charitable Trust in 2010 is ensuring the ongoing viability of the centre.</p><p>The community-based centre has been in operation for many years, with some children now attending whose parents also attended as children. Parents report that they enjoy the calm, settled atmosphere at the centre. They appreciate the focus on wh&#257;nau and the strong sense of belonging children feel. A positive centre culture is well established and teachers demonstrate the service&rsquo;s philosophy in their practice. Good practices identified in previous ERO reports have been maintained.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children relate well to each other and play happily in groups and on their own. They are given a variety of opportunities to develop independence and self help skills. Teachers use strategies and resources that support children to develop social competence. Teachers are sensitive towards children and support their choices in play. They promote early literacy and numeracy learning, and provide children with opportunities to play for extended periods of time.</p><p>Teachers plan programme topics from children&rsquo;s group interests. Some skilled assessment practices, and a well established process of programme evaluation that is shared across the teaching team, are evident. Teachers could now be more deliberate about noticing and planning for the strengths, interests and abilities of individual children and documenting the continuity of their progress and learning over time. They could also build on this good work with parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga to further promote the language, culture and identity of all ethnicities represented at the centre.</p><p>The Treaty of Waitangi policy outlines the centre&rsquo;s acknowledgement and commitment to M&#257;ori. Teachers have begun to use te reo within the programme and now need to build their capacity to integrate te ao M&#257;ori more fully in the programme. Plans to involve parents in this work are underway.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; skills and talents are valued and supported by leaders. They engage in respectful and responsive relationships with children and parents. Teachers provide good support for children and families when transitioning into and beyond the centre. There is good provision and support for children with special needs.</p><p>A shared leadership style encourages mutual respect and contributes to a positive working relationship amongst staff. Developing leadership is a focus with staff and with children. The implementation of a newly established appraisal system should help to ensure a more rigorous process that matches centre policy.</p><p>Centre leaders agree that self review needs formalising. A more robust, scheduled review process where outcomes for children are documented would support centre improvement and the identification of strategic development priorities. Staff continue to review the effectiveness of the environment in supporting children&rsquo;s learning and engagement. They should monitor children&rsquo;s access to the outdoor environment to ensure that children have extended periods to use this space for enhancing their learning and development.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Northcote Pre-School Community Trust (Kete Wananga) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
