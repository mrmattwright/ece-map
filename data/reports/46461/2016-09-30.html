</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Three Little Birds Childcare and Education Centre provides a full day learning and care programme for children from the local community of Tikipunga in Whangarei. The centre is licensed for 40 children, including eight up to the age of two years, and operates in a newly renovated house set in a large outdoor space. This is the first ERO report for the centre.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age for parts of the day, with infants and toddlers having a separate room and playground. Not all children attend the centre for the whole week.</p><p>The majority of the children attending the centre have MƒÅori and Pacific cultural backgrounds. In response to this, the philosophy developed by staff includes reference to the focus teachers place on MƒÅori values, their responsibilities under Te Tiriti o Waitangi, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and cultural inclusion. They see their work as being built around their local learning community which includes tamariki, kaiako, whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi.</p><p>The centre is a privately owned, and managed by an on-site manager. Teachers are guided by a professional leader to provide good quality teaching and learning programmes for children. The majority of teachers are qualified and registered.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children attending the centre are settled, confident and highly engaged in play. They are warmly and affectionately welcomed by teachers at the start of their day, and quickly connect with their playmates. Teachers provide resources and environments that encourage children to explore and take learning risks in enjoyable, meaningful activities.</p><p>Children are able to practise and refine skills and attributes with encouragement and support from teachers. Teachers' positive and responsive conversations with children are helping them to problem-solve, develop positive relationships with others and to become confident and capable.</p><p>Teachers recognise the importance of culture, language and identity. They use te reo MƒÅori interspersed with English in the programme incidentally and consistently. As a result, children also use te reo MƒÅori in their conversations with their friends. Children's cultural identity is celebrated and there is a strong focus on supporting children's understanding of tikanga, tuakana teina relationships, and te Ao MƒÅori. Children demonstrate understanding and respect for these protocols.</p><p>Teachers' care for the infants and toddlers is sensitive and gentle. They know children well and are encouraging in their play. Teachers sing and talk to children, maintaining a calm and settled environment. Children demonstrate trusting and confident relationships with teachers. Children with diverse needs are also well supported by strong relationships between the service and external support agencies.</p><p>Teachers manage children's transitions into and through the centre effectively. They visit the homes of all families and establish relationships with whƒÅnau that are supportive and caring. Teachers believe that knowing children's whƒÅnau adds considerably to their ability to connect well with children. Centre staff provide a pick-up and drop-off service for children from home to the centre and back. They also provide nourishing, well-prepared food for all children throughout the day.</p><p>Assessment processes are regular, based on positive recognition and highly responsive to individual children's strengths, dispositions and interests. Teachers manage and organise teaching and learning programmes using approaches that foster positive behaviour and pleasure in learning. A sense of ako is deeply embedded in the ways that children learn from teachers and vice versa. Leaders have established a culture in which children are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Systems and frameworks of policies, procedures, financial management and day-to-day organisation is efficient and effective. The appointment of staff has been strategic in order to strengthen collaborative thinking and practice across the teaching team. There are good systems in place to challenge and inform teachers' practices including appraisal and professional development. Management encourages emergent leadership for both teachers and children.</p><p>Teachers and management use self review to build their capacity for continual improvement. They are aware of their responsibility to advocate for infants, toddlers and young children. Centre practices actively promote the rights of all children to high quality and inclusive early childhood learning. There is a high level of relational trust amongst all involved in the centre. This is conducive to negotiation, problem-solving and critical reflection.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Three Little Birds management agree with ERO's suggestions about next steps for the centre. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening aspects of challenge in the programme to deepen the complexity of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including children in decision-making about resources and play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a whƒÅnau group to further strengthen the centre's collaborative and communication strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Three Little Birds Childcare &amp; Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Three Little Birds Childcare &amp; Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>¬†</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>¬†</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
