</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Connection Daycare Ltd is located in Mangere, Auckland. This well established, privately owned early childhood centre provides all-day care and education for up 100 children, including 25 infants and toddlers. The centre provides a van service for families who require transport. The majority of children enrolled have MƒÅori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in August 2011, the centre has been merged under one licence. Changes include the provision of rooms for four-year-olds and a small separate room for the younger two-year-olds. The centre now has separate spaces for the different age groups. Each group is led by a team leader who supports the provision of high quality early childhood education.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs leadership team consists of the owner, centre manager and three head teachers. The owner and centre manager provide high quality governance and effective professional leadership to support the operation of the centre. Children continue to receive high quality care and education in a warm and nurturing family atmosphere that sustains and promotes positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy and vision are well reflected in practice. The programme focuses on the interests of children and the aspirations of parents. Positive, respectful interactions characterise centre relationships. Children, parents and whƒÅnau are warmly received and welcomed. These relationships help provide a nurturing, settled environment that supports children‚Äôs wellbeing and fosters their sense of belonging.</p><p>The well-designed curriculum supports children‚Äôs overall development and learning. It provides them with appropriate opportunities to investigate, initiate their own learning and be imaginative and creative. Children have daily opportunities to develop early skills in reading, writing and mathematics. Teachers recognise and respond to children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds. Their commitment to bi-cultural practices means that diversity is celebrated through cultural events.</p><p>Programmes develop appropriately from what teachers and parents notice about children‚Äôs learning. Children‚Äôs interests and strengths are identified through individual learning pathways that reflect the complexity and deeper levels of their skills and dispositions. Parents‚Äô aspirations are reflected in centre programmes and records of children‚Äôs learning. These approaches help teachers to provide a comprehensive curriculum that is significant and relevant for children and their families. Transition practices within the centre and to local schools are well developed.</p><p>Teachers use their knowledge of children and their families to engage children in meaningful conversations throughout the day. They talk freely with children, helping them develop their social skills, their language and their learning. Children engage in sustained collaborative play and show respect for one another while working in small groups. They are also taught how to deal with conflict where it arises and how to solve problems together. These strategies promote the development of children‚Äôs independence and self-help skills.</p><p>The centre benefits from highly capable leadership and collaborative team work. Teachers work well together. Centre leaders and teachers participate in high quality ongoing professional development to learn about current best practice in early childhood education. They make effective use of updated information and research. They reflect and evaluate their practices. These approaches enable staff to continue providing high quality care and education for children.</p><p>The owner and centre manager maintain knowledgeable and capable oversight of the centre. The policy framework and management planning are sound. Centre self review is rigorous, systematic, and well documented. The owner, centre manager and teachers undertake in-depth review focused on improvement at all levels of centre operations and invite parent contributions and feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next stages of centre development could include managers and staff continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>promote the ongoing development of a professional culture of critical reflection and evaluation</li>
<li>extend children‚Äôs learning opportunities through intentional teaching strategies and formative assessment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Connection Daycare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Connection Daycare Ltd will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
