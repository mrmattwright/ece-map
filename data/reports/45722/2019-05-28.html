</table><p>Step 2 Growth Marlborough Ltd¬†is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Step 2 Growth Marlborough Ltd is a locally owned and operated home-based childcare service in the Marlborough Region. It comprises of one network with 9 educators. Of the 33 children enrolled six identify as MƒÅori. One coordinator has day-to-day responsibility for the network.</p><p>The mission statement advises: "taking educational steps to expand the growth and development of young minds and hearts, through the nurturing of home-based care".</p><p>Leaders have responsibility for the provision of care, implementation of an effective curriculum and professional support for educators.¬†</p><p>This is the first report for Step 2 Growth Marlborough Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a range of interesting activities in educator homes. Weekly playgroups and regular excursions are offered for educators and children. These provide opportunities for them to meet socially. Providing a wider range of curriculum experiences for children at playgroup to extend learning would be beneficial and compliment the in-home programmes.</p><p>Greater clarification of the expectation for the home visits undertaken by the coordinators from the service provider is required. Regular visits are undertaken to educator homes, however documentation does not clearly show how educators are being supported to develop their practice. The coordinator visit records should be strengthened to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Follow-up and monitoring of issues related to health and safety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how educators are supported in the meaningful use of te reo MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evidence of modelling effective assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Assessment is not well understood. Developing a procedure to guide coordinator and educator practice is essential to support implementation. Educators regularly complete anecdotal notes of children‚Äôs engagement in the programme provided, a focus on planning for children‚Äôs learning including working with parent aspirations, requires development. This should be achieved through specific guidance and targeted support from the coordinator and implementation monitored and evaluated over time.</p><p>The development of an appraisal process is a priority. Appraisal was not completed for the coordinator or educators in 2018. The coordinator‚Äôs appraisal for 2019 is not robust. A higher level of engagement is required with a greater understanding of evidencing <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession.</em></p><p>Leaders have yet to develop and implement a suitable review and internal evaluation processes focused on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Positive relationships are evident between the educators and parents. However, a greater focus on learning partnerships should be developed.</p><p>The philosophy, recently revised, does not clearly show the learning that is valued in Step 2 Growth. There should be a clearer link to the philosophy in action, through educator practice and coordinator reports.</p><p>The service provider must improve the monitoring of all systems and processes including policy reviews. She needs to be assured that the service meets legislative requirements, particularly for health and safety, and provides high quality home based education and care. Priorities for improvement include fully completing the required documentation for all aspects of operation. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>police vetting for all involved in the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implementing the revised job description for the coordinator (developed late 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently documenting follow-up of actions to meet health and safety requirements at educator homes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of a policy or procedure for appraisal and staff appointments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revisiting the child protection policy to include all aspects of the safety checking process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>closer monitoring of identification of risks, specifically around animals, and enacting a plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, roles and responsibilities of paid staff should be clearly defined to support shared understandings of service expectations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Step 2 Growth Marlborough Ltd completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for accountability and improvement for the quality of education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual review of written emergency plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal for educators and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checking of workers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, C2, C5, C6, HS4, GMA5, GMA6A.]</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Step 2 Growth Marlborough Ltd. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>28 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
