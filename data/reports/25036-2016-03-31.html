</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scholars Preschool is a well-established centre in Drury, South Auckland. It provides education and care for up to 30 children including up to 10 children under the age of two. The centre is one of three managed collectively by the owner and the three centre managers. Together, they oversee the centres using a common set of policies and procedures that are adapted for each centre.</p><p>There are three play areas designed for each age group. These include an area for children under two, another for children between three and four years of age, and a third area for pre-schoolers. Children have many opportunities to play together indoors and outdoors. Teachers use the mixed aged play time to promote tuakana teina relationships as children grow and develop in the centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes opportunities for children to explore and discover through positive interactions with other children and adults. There are seven qualified teachers and this enables leaders to maintain low child/teacher ratios.</p><p>Centre leaders responded positively to the recommendations of the 2013 ERO report. They have made ongoing improvements to strengthen approaches to programme planning and assessment. In addition, the documentation of learning stories has been improved and te reo Māori is being integrated more frequently into the daily programme.</p><p>Indoor and outdoor play areas and staff amenities have been upgraded and there are further renovations, still to be completed. An after-school facility next to the centre provides ongoing links with some families once children have transitioned to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children greet teachers and settle quickly into activities. Teachers and parents regularly discuss children's experiences and learning interests and this helps to strengthen the partnerships between home and the centre.</p><p>Children have access to a large outdoor space for play. They are confident to explore this area and enjoy the many challenges it offers them. Children play and share with each other and talk confidently with adults. They make choices about their play and teachers ask questions to strengthen children's understanding.</p><p>Teachers plan learning experiences for individual and groups of children. Currently, teachers are focusing on giving children more opportunities to lead learning activities. Assessment portfolios are a good record of children's involvement and interests. Leaders agree that the inclusion of children's voices in learning stories continues to be an area for improvement. Leaders are investigating the potential of electronic portfolios to encourage contributions from families.</p><p>There is very good care and education for children under two years. Teachers encourage children's language growth and understanding of the world around them. They provide challenges for children's physical and social development. Teachers keep parents well informed as children move through important developmental stages.</p><p>Teachers are more confident in their use of te reo Maori. Leaders identified the value of the teacher-led professional learning programme and support from a local iwi group. This has helped to develop teachers' confidence and competence with te reo. Leaders plan to continue supporting ongoing teacher development in bicultural practices.</p><p>Centre leaders value the strengths that individual staff members bring to their roles and they meet regularly with teachers to reflect on teaching practice. They support and provide targeted professional learning for teachers. Leaders are currently working with an external provider to review the teacher appraisal policy and procedures.</p><p>The centre manager manages all aspects of centre operations. She is well supported by her teachers. Leaders agree that it is timely to rationalise aspects of the centre manager's workload. They also identified as an important next step a review of governance and management documents to ensure there are clear links between policies and procedures. Practices that support distributive leadership are already becoming evident.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on current good practices, the owner, and centre managers agree that key next steps are to consider further ways to:</p><ul>
<li>improve the quality of self-review so that it is more evaluative</li>
<li>create complex and innovative play that develops children's individual strengths and interests using targeted teaching strategies</li>
<li>strengthen teacher appraisal to ensure there are clear and transparent links to work expectations</li>
<li>strengthen the policy review cycle to ensure systematic checks and reviews are purposeful and useful.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scholars Preschool Drury Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scholars Preschool Drury Limited will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>31 March 2016<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
