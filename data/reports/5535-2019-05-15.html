</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Belfast is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Belfast is one of 69 early learning services governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The kindergarten provides for the education and care of young children from two to school age. All teachers/kaiako are qualified and certified. The association education manager (EM) provides consistent professional advice and guidance to support the effective operation of the service.</p><p>The kindergarten's vision is to establish strong pathways into the future by empowering children to learn through relationships, which build confident, respectful and connected akonga. Its curriculum priorities include self regulation, risk taking, playing together, and caring / manaakitanga.</p><p>ERO's February 2013 report noted that teachers needed to further develop and refine some aspects of children‚Äôs assessment and programme planning, and that bicultural practices needed strengthening.</p><p>This review was one of seven kindergartens in the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are using a range of strategies to promote children‚Äôs social and emotional competencies. Self regulation is a priority of the kindergarten‚Äôs curriculum. Teachers have undertaken training into this aspect of the curriculum. Their collaborative approach includes the children‚Äôs whƒÅnau, and learning and behaviour specialists. They use specific teaching strategies and resources to provide calming, sensory experiences that foster children‚Äôs resilience.</p><p>Children play and learn in an environment that values te ao and tikanga MƒÅori. The purposeful links with MƒÅori whƒÅnau support the bicultural curriculum. MƒÅori parents support the teachers‚Äô use of te reo MƒÅori. They have been instrumental in bringing MƒÅori concepts and resources into the kindergarten. Teachers are respectful of tikanga MƒÅori with these concepts increasingly woven into the kindergarten‚Äôs documentation.</p><p>Strong learning community partnerships provide opportunities for the kindergarten to contribute to, and gain from, the wider education community. Teachers share their expertise within the cluster. They are involved in professional learning and development, research, and national presentations about their work on resilience. Children are well supported as they transition on to school.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association has a well-developed and clearly understood vision. It is underpinned by targeted strategic and annual planning systems. There are close links between the kindergarten plans, internal evaluation, appraisal and professional development. The teachers are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the priorities of the kindergarten and to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Since the last review, a restructure has enabled a key focus on education excellence within the kindergartens, and innovation and collaboration within the association and in the wider early childhood community. Key staff make a significant contribution to supporting other early learning services in Te Waipounamu / South Island.</p><p>The association has a very strong commitment to providing high quality professional development to build on leadership capacity and teacher capability. It has high expectations for teaching and learning and equitable outcomes for all children. This includes promoting understandings of and respect for te ao MƒÅori at all levels of the organisation. The association's internal evaluation practices are being well used to inform decision making and support the strong focus on continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the teaching team agrees, that further work is needed to develop and embed the initiatives recently introduced. Improvements are needed in planning, internal evaluation, and the appraisal process in order to provide consistent rich learning opportunities and experiences for children across the curriculum. In particular, they need to evaluate the impact of teaching practices and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Belfast completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>15 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
