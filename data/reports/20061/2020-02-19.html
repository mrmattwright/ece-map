</table><p>Greenlane Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greenlane Childcare Centre is a well-established early childhood centre. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including up to three under two years of age. All children share the indoor and spacious outside spaces.</p><p>The centre owner is the director and maintains a strong interest and oversight of the centre. The long-serving centre manager is responsible for day-to-day operations. She leads a stable team of four qualified teachers, including a head teacher, and part-time staff. There are high staff:child ratios.</p><p>The centre's philosophy of creating a home away from home where children can learn, be loved and have fun guides centre practices. This philosophy is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report acknowledged the calm, child-focused environment, the children's strong sense of belonging and their sustained play and learning through purposefully selected resources. These aspects of good practice continue to be positive features of the centre. The report also identified areas to strengthen, including appraisal processes and leadership support. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle very quickly. Teachers provide an environment that has a calm atmosphere and focuses on building a sense of belonging. Their interactions are respectful and responsive to children's needs and wishes.</p><p>Children are developing social competence. They are articulate and confident. Children are empowered to take responsibility and make decisions about their play and learning. They develop friendships and play well together through creating challenging and problem-solving play possibilities. Teachers are growing in their confidence to implement bicultural practices.</p><p>Children benefit from a variety of open-ended resources that enable sustained play and learning. They explore, inquire, experiment, take risks and solve problems in the spacious, shared learning areas. Teachers take advantage of the proximity to Cornwall Park with regular visits to provide rich experiences that build on the children's oral language and understandings about the world.</p><p>Learning programmes are based on children‚Äôs dispositions and emerging interests. Teachers use a ‚Äònotice, recognise and respond‚Äô approach to assess and plan for children's learning. They plan programmes that provide all children with opportunities for challenge and complexity in their play. The owner and leaders value professional development, with a strong focus on curriculum and leadership, that contributes to ongoing improvements.</p><p>There is a strong sense of belonging and partnerships with whƒÅnau. Parents who spoke to ERO appreciate how leaders and teachers provide opportunities for parents to be engaged in their children‚Äôs learning and to socialise with other families. WhƒÅnau are kept informed through daily electronic communication, informal discussions and individual portfolios.</p><p>The owner and leaders value professional development, with a strong focus on curriculum and leadership, that contributes to ongoing improvements.</p><p>Systems for monitoring and promoting improvement have been established. Strengthening the alignment between the philosophy and strategic and annual plans could guide future direction. More formal evaluation of the impact of teachers' planning and programme implementation on outcomes for children, should support ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for continual improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>specific reflection and evaluation of the impact of programme planning and practice on children's learning outcomes, including the programme for four-year-old children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning to make the children's learning more visible and inclusive of MƒÅori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening appraisal processes by using formal observations of teachers' practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greenlane Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services¬†</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
