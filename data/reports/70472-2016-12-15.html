</table><p>The Cathedral Grammar School Pre-School is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Cathedral Grammar Preschool provides education and care for children aged from three to five years. It is a part of The Cathedral Grammar School and is located on the same site. The preschool is managed by the principal on behalf of the school board. The centre shares the school’s association with the Anglican Church. Many of the children go on to attend the school.</p><p>Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers. There have been significant changes in staff, including the head teacher, during 2015 and 2016.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have introduced a range of initiatives during 2016 that have helped to address the key next steps from the 2013 ERO review. These include, an extensive revision of the preschool philosophy, developing annual strategic action plans and continuing to implement the appraisal system.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and focused on learning. They experience positive, respectful interactions with each other and their teachers. Children have a wide range of additional learning opportunities provided by specialist staff in the arts and physical activities.</p><p>Children are well supported in their learning by teachers who actively promote the preschool's values throughout the learning programme. They use a number of effective strategies to support children’s learning and foster their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers listen carefully to children and ask questions that challenge them to extend their ideas and thinking.</p><p>Teachers successfully use their knowledge of individual children to create interesting learning spaces in the well-presented indoor and outside environments. Children engage happily in exploratory and creative play for long periods of uninterrupted time.</p><p>Teachers are providing an increasingly integrated approach to fostering bicultural knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Transition into the centre is flexible and carefully planned to meet the needs of children and families. Transition to the school is well managed and supported by teachers.</p><p>Teachers work well together and make good use of staff strengths to help build their reflective practices. They give appropriate emphasis to keeping parents informed about the learning programme, centre events and their child’s learning.</p><p>Preschool leaders have established high expectations for staff and provide strong professional leadership. Children benefit from the significant improvements in the learning programme and child assessment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Significant change has occurred within the preschool over the past 12 months. The board is to appoint a new head teacher. Leaders and ERO agree it is critical that the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further embedding appraisal practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build on the integration of bicultural practices into learning programmes and key centre documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing staff capacity in self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Cathedral Grammar School Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Most school policies relate to the school and preschool. However, to ensure that the requirements of the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008 are met, a review of current policies and procedures should be completed against these criteria and relevant areas addressed where these do not adequately provide for meeting the requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Cathedral Grammar School Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu/Southern</p><p>15 December 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
