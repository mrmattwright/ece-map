</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>About Kids Network 1 is one of two networks operating as part of the About Kids home-based education and care service. The family owned and operated service provides for children up to six years of age across a diverse group of communities from Raumati South to Levin. Educators in this home-based network work in their own homes to provide education and care for up to four children at any one time. Twenty-five percent of children enrolled have Māori heritage.</p><p>Two coordinators who are qualified and registered early childhood teachers visit homes and support educators to plan for and provide educational programmes for children. The coordinators lead regular playgroups to model new ideas and ways to extend children’s learning in large group situations.</p><p>The vision of the service is to ‘provide a stimulating home-based learning environment, where children learn and develop through exploring new and exciting experiences’. This is the first ERO review of About Kids Network 1.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from being in homes with an educator who knows them well. The small group size particularly supports the wellbeing of infants and toddlers. Through everyday activities, children have many opportunities to develop early literacy, creativity and science skills and knowledge.</p><p>Within this review, ERO investigated how well children are supported to become capable and confident mathematical learners. Children have opportunities to learn about mathematical concepts such as sorting, counting, shapes, and measurement in their everyday experiences. Coordinators agreed that having a more deliberate lens on promoting and documenting children's mathematical learning would be beneficial.</p><p>Coordinators skilfully support educators to plan and provide learning experiences that are responsive to individual children's strengths, interests and abilities. They work with families, including whānau Māori, to be responsive to their wishes for their children’s learning. In-depth learning records show children’s progress and learning becoming more complex over time. A next step is for coordinators to support educators to further develop their understandings of te ao Māori perspectives, integrate these into learning experiences and document in children's portfolios.</p><p>Coordinators carefully plan regular playgroups and excursions that respond to children’s interests and foster their social development and independence. Playgroups provide opportunities for educators to share ideas to improve their practice.</p><p>Coordinators effectively bring a fun and innovative approach to their work. This is particularly evident in the way they:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>work with educators to recognise learning and plan next steps to extend and challenge children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide effective guidance and feedback to help build educator confidence and capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a continued focus on improving teaching practices to support children in their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service is guided by a clear vision, philosophy and long and short term plans. A high quality selfreview process is used to evaluate how well the service is achieving its goals. Coordinators make ongoing improvements as a result of what they find. They recognise they could better record key decisions and aspects relating to their role and responsibilities. The service provider has identified the need to review and improve some personnel practices.</p><p>There are sufficient systems to support the effective operation of the service, including monitoring of health and safety requirements in educators’ homes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service leaders agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening practices that reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to enhance parent/whānau partnerships to support children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve personnel practices by appointing an external appraiser for coordinators, reviewing job descriptions and the appraisal process so they align with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of About Kids Network 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of About Kids Network 1 will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>6 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
