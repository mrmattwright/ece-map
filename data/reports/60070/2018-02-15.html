</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>About Kids Network 1 based in Paraparaumu is one of two networks operating as a home based education and care service. Family owned and operated, it provides for children up to six years of age, from Raumati South to Levin. Educators work in their own homes to provide education and care for up to four children. Of the 94 children enrolled, 38 identify as Māori.</p><p>Three coordinators, who are qualified and registered early childhood teachers, visit homes to support educators. They coordinate lead regular playgroups to model new ideas and ways to extend children's learning in large group situations.</p><p>The vision for the service is to 'provide a stimulating home-based learning environment, where children learn and develop through explore through new and exciting experiences'.</p><p>Since the November 2014 ERO report, improvements have been made to address the key next steps.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service has a clearly defined commitment to providing high quality education and care for children. A shared understanding of the service's philosophy, vision, goals and systems contribute to positive outcomes for children. These are regularly monitored by coordinators during regular home visits.</p><p>An effective induction process of educators promotes children's strong sense of belonging between educators, whānau and coordinators. Positive, responsive and reciprocal relationships are fostered.</p><p>Regular playgroup experiences are carefully considered. Ongoing review supports coordinators to provide deliberate planning that facilitates additional learning opportunities for children within the community and with other educators. Infants and toddlers are well supported to fully participate in the learning programme.</p><p>Assessment of children's learning is well developed. Children's profile books capture their involvement in a wide range of experiences that promote their independence and confidence over time. A key next step is to improve the response to children's language, culture and identity to further strengthen the process.</p><p>Educators are effectively supported to plan and provide learning experiences that are responsive to individual children's strengths, abilities and interests. A range of teaching strategies and resources extend children's learning.  </p><p>There is a commitment to strengthening the bicultural curriculum within the organisation. Local expertise provides children and educators with opportunities to learn aspects of te ao Māori. Leaders recognise that further developing learning partnerships with whānau Māori is required to support improved learning outcomes for Māori children.</p><p>Leaders identify that building their capability to respond to Pacific learners continues to need strengthening. ERO's evaluation confirms this ongoing development.</p><p>An inclusive learning environment contributes to successful outcomes for children with additional learning needs. Coordinators and educators work with parents and whānau to fully support children's participation and engagement in a programme that is responsive to their individual requirements.</p><p>A focus on children's transition to school has contributed to an improved understanding of good practices within a home based context. Information sharing between coordinators, educators and parents fosters children's growing independence as they move to the next stage of their learning journey.</p><p>An effective cycle of review contributes to change and improvement. Leaders recognise that further monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness practices to improve outcomes for children is a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the priorities for this service to strengthen are:</p><ul>
<li>the provision of the bicultural curriculum and strategies to promote success for Māori</li>
<li>the response to children's language, culture and identity within assessment and planning</li>
<li>the monitoring and evaluation of the impact of changes made to improve learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of About Kids Network 1 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>•       curriculum</p><p>•       premises and facilities</p><p>•       health and safety practices</p><p>•       governance, management and administration.</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of About Kids Network 1 will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>15 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
