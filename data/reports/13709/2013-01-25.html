<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Mangawhai Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children&rsquo;s wellbeing and learning.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Mangawhai Kindergarten is a semi-rural service in a Northland seaside community. In 2009 the kindergarten changed from a sessional service to providing a six-hour session each week day. The community has responded well to this model of provision. It has also enabled an improved adult to child ratio. The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association which provides a policy framework and good professional guidance for teachers. An administrator, support worker and a parent support group also assist in the kindergarten.</p>
<p>The teaching team has been unchanged for three years. This stability has resulted in a shared understanding about teaching approaches and many opportunities to participate together in professional development. Teachers have worked cooperatively to manage the recent major renovations of the building and are using this opportunity to upgrade play areas.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are happy and settled in the kindergarten. They confidently make choices about their play and work well with their peers in small cooperative groups. Children benefit from involvement in ongoing topics that develop from their interests and from a growing variety of resources that enhance their learning experiences. Children participate enthusiastically in the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers actively encourage children&rsquo;s involvement in play. They engage children in meaningful conversations and are responsive to their ideas for programme topics. Teachers provide very good opportunities for children to develop early literacy skills and integrate numeracy experiences in several areas of play. Teachers are currently developing ways to extend children&rsquo;s learning through information and communication technologies (ICT) and are enhancing their focus on science in the programme. They trust children as independent learners, provide well for those with special needs and foster tuakana/teina relationships between children.</p>
<p>Teachers have established positive relationships with families and the community. They consult parents about their child&rsquo;s learning and involve them in reviewing policies and goals. Teachers welcome family members in the environment to support children&rsquo;s play and share their own knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Teachers are committed to integrating bicultural perspectives that foster understanding of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori. Children enjoy waiata and benefit from visits to the M&#257;ori Marae and Cultural Centre at Te Hana. Teachers agree this is a sound foundation to encourage more M&#257;ori families to participate in the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Teachers have well established processes for planning and evaluating the programme. They identify activities and resources to enrich learning related to topics of interest and strategies to respond to children with specific interests. Teachers recognise that further documentation of ongoing planning would enable them to more effectively show how they are extending children&rsquo;s learning. Children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios are attractive records that teachers are using well to identify individual learning. Teachers can also enhance these records with better evidence of their interventions to extend learning.</p>
<p>Teachers are exploring ways to strengthen their self-review processes. Recent reviews have resulted in improvements to some play areas, new ideas for literacy and updated strategic planning. Teachers recognise the need to build on the depth and breadth of their self review particularly in the ways they record their strategies for improvement.</p>
<p>The professional services manager (PSM) provides good liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. Through her regular visits she raises teachers&rsquo; awareness of Association services, documentation and expectations and challenges them to strive for improvements. Her feedback through head teacher appraisals and visit reports helps teachers to identify goals, initiate new ideas and reflect on their practices. The PSM will continue to support teachers to strengthen the focus of the kindergarten&rsquo;s strategic plan and in the development of self-review processes.</p>
<p>ERO and teachers agree that the next steps for the kindergarten&rsquo;s ongoing review and improvement should include:</p>
<ul><li>strengthening the documentation of self-review processes and the clarity of strategic goals</li>
<li>continuing to refine planning and assessment practices with a focus on identifying the teachers&rsquo; role in extending learning</li>
<li>building on teachers&rsquo; knowledge of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori and further engaging the M&#257;ori community in the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangawhai Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
