</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tuakau Learning Centre was established in a purpose-built facility in 2013. In March 2015 a second building was added and the licence increased to cater for 118 children, including up to 30 infants and toddlers. There are 47 M&#257;ori children enrolled, six children from Pacific nations, and a small group with diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>The two managers are highly committed to removing barriers to local children&rsquo;s participation in early childhood education. They are flexible and responsive to wh&#257;nau requirements, and are passionate about supporting and providing a high quality service for children, their families and the community.</p>
<p>The managers&rsquo; philosophical beliefs underpin centre operations. They prioritise a safe, inclusive and settled learning environment for children. Respectful relationships and children&rsquo;s independence are seen as a basis for programme development. Managers are committed to increasing the use of te reo M&#257;ori in the centre to better reflect their recognition of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Teaching practices are being increasingly influenced by the Reggio Emelia philosophy.</p>
<p>Both buildings contain an office, staffroom and kitchen facilities. The first building provides programmes for about 13 toddlers in Ruma P&#333;tiki, and for up to 36 two and three year olds in Ng&#257; Teina. In the second building, there are up to 11 infants in Ng&#257; P&#275;pi, and Ng&#257; Tu&#257;kana caters for the oldest children. Four separate outdoor play areas are situated between the two buildings. The large group of staff includes 16 registered teachers, with a head teacher in each room. New teaching teams are becoming established as they adapt to the new building and layouts.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are well supported to be capable communicators and independent learners. Older children confidently engage in conversation with visitors. Teachers focus on responding to children&rsquo;s interests and ideas and encourage creative thinking.</p>
<p>In Ng&#257; P&#275;pi, teachers&rsquo; focus is on developing secure attachment relationships. Practices in this room are influenced by the Pikler philosophy around care, interactions and environments. Resources and displays are kept to a minimum. Children&rsquo;s transitions into the centre and between rooms are carefully managed. Managers have made useful connections with local schools to support smooth transitions when children leave the centre.</p>
<p>Trusting relationships and connections with families are important to managers and senior teachers. Parents appreciate the welcoming, inclusive and caring environment and the natural features of the outdoor spaces. They have good opportunities to provide managers and teachers with feedback.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy promotes uncluttered environments where teachers select resources and prompts for children to explore. Children are able to ask for additional resources to support their learning. Outdoor environments for Ng&#257; Tu&#257;kana, Ng&#257; Teina and Ruma P&#333;tiki are attractively landscaped and provide inviting spaces where children can play together and develop creative, imaginative play. These environments provide some good physical challenges for children.</p>
<p>Managers are developing consultative relationships with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori and community groups to inform policy and programme developments. Teachers often include waiata and te reo M&#257;ori phrases during the programme. Teaching teams could now consider ways to better reflect family and community cultures and languages in centre environments.</p>
<p>Teachers have established good processes for documenting assessment, planning and programme review. Children&rsquo;s individual learning journals record their interests, involvement in the programme, and developing relationships and dispositions for learning. Parent contributions are sometimes recorded. Increasing the visibility of teachers&rsquo; partnership with families would enhance these learning records. Teachers could also deepen their evaluation to consider the effectiveness of their planned and spontaneous teaching strategies.</p>
<p>Managers and a teacher who was recently appointed to provide professional guidance for teaching teams, are very experienced in early childhood education. The head teacher in Ng&#257; Tu&#257;kana is leading the development of Reggio Emelia influences. Centre leaders are planning to make better use of professional development, mentoring and appraisal to critique and strengthen teaching practice, and promote consistency across the centre.</p>
<p>Managers have established a good framework of policies, and strategic goals that are linked to the centre&rsquo;s philosophical foundations. These documents provide good guidance for ongoing developments in the centre. Managers review progress made towards achieving their goals each year. They have established useful, consultative processes for self review, which help teachers to think about ways to adapt their practice. Managers are reflective and strategic in their thinking and in their leadership of the centre.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Managers&rsquo; key strategic goals are to increase teachers&rsquo; confidence and skill in using te reo, and to build teacher capability and collaboration. They plan to establish a more consistently child-led curriculum across the centre. These goals are appropriate at this early stage of centre development.</p>
<p>To support the managers&rsquo; goals of increased quality and consistency and a child-led curriculum, they could:</p>
<ul><li>use more specific indicators of effective practice in early childhood education to deepen evaluative self review and to identify ways to enhance learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>increase children&rsquo;s independent access to a wider variety of high quality educational resources that interest them and support their learning</li>
<li>develop teachers&rsquo; shared, in-depth understandings about their role in promoting complex play, extended learning, and focused, purposeful engagement in the context of a child-led curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tuakau Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Tuakau Learning Centre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ng&#257; Pou Here:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
