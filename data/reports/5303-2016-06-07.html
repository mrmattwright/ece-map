</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Appleton Kindergarten is in Dannevirke, Tararua. It provides early childhood education and care for up to 40 children aged over two. The current roll is 48 children, including seven MƒÅori children.</p><p>Appleton Kindergarten is one of two kindergartens managed by the Dannevirke Kindergarten Association (the association). A governing body is responsible for setting the overall strategic and policy direction of the organisation. An association manager is employed to manage day-to-day operations. A professional practice manager (PPM) supports kindergarten teachers in their delivery of the curriculum.</p><p>Since the December 2012 ERO report, four successive PPMs have been employed. For several months, the PPM role was not filled. In January 2015, the association contracted the role of PPM to an outside provider. The present PPM was allocated by the provider in March 2016.</p><p>In 2013, the association opened a purpose-built association whƒÅnau room, Te WhƒÅre Koha. This is used as a learning and social hub for kindergarten whƒÅnau and the wider Dannevirke community.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Appleton Kindergarten identified areas needing further development including: philosophy review, assessment of children's learning, bicultural practices, self review and aspects of teaching to extend children's learning. These have been a priority for staff and considerable progress has been made. Internal evaluation remains an area requiring further development.</p><p>A new teaching team has been established since 2012. Some teachers are in temporary positions pending the return of permanent staff or until current staffing requirements are confirmed by the association. A new head teacher was appointed in March 2014.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Dannevirke Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children learn about the five virtues of enthusiasm, responsibility, respect, friendliness and patience. They frequently demonstrate these in their play and interactions.</p><p>Teachers successfully extend children's learning through rich conversations and responsive planning. They are proactive in their response to individual needs. They work collaboratively with parents and whƒÅnau to support children's progress in learning.</p><p>Bicultural practice is strongly evident and is woven naturally throughout the programme. MƒÅori children's culture is nurtured and cherished. They lead their peers and teachers in tikanga MƒÅori and share their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. A sense of tuakana teina and ako is evident.</p><p>Teachers successfully plan and implement a curriculum designed to enhance children's learning. Assessment is highly collaborative. Children's understanding of their own learning, and of their peers, is compared with teachers' interpretations of their play. Electronic learning stories, shared and discussed with families using an internet-based system, complement this collaborative approach.</p><p>Children and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten in a calm, unhurried manner. They are supported to settle at their own pace. A useful range of strategies supports older children and their families as they prepare for their move to school.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective. They engage in daily discussion and debate that challenges and informs improvement of their practice. They identified a need to revisit the principles and purpose of self review and a new process was introduced in 2016. ERO affirms this decision. Teachers should continue to embed this approach and use more evaluative practice.</p><p>At Appleton, teachers are well supported to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The head teacher provides strong professional leadership. She fosters a culture of reflection and constructive critique.</p><p>The association has experienced difficulty in filling the role of professional practice manager. Managing the impact of this has been a challenge for the board. Not all PPMs have kept trustees well informed of the quality of curriculum delivery or of their communications with individual kindergartens and teachers. Strengthening processes around the recruitment and expectations of the PPM role is an important next step.</p><p>Appropriate policies are in place to inform and guide kindergarten operations. Board members show a commitment to the organisation. They have attended training to better understand their governance roles. Their recent review of the appraisal process has led to positive changes in line with recent best practice guidelines for teacher registration and licence renewal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Appleton Kindergarten:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Trustees and the association manager of Dannevirke Kindergarten Association should continue to strengthen processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness of the current method of accessing professional practice support for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making clear their expectations for the role of PPM, including clear guidance on the expected regularity and content of reports to the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing protocols for communication exchange between PPMs and individual kindergartens and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying responsibilities for the appraisal of contracted PPMs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the association has started to address these issues.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Appleton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Appleton Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
