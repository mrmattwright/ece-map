</table><p>Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 2¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 2 is situated in Avalon, Lower Hutt and provides education and care for children aged from infancy to three years. The privately-owned service is licensed for 44 children, including 22 up to two years. Of the 33 children currently enrolled, 13 are Pacific and five are MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is divided into two adjacent areas. 'The Cottage' caters for infants from birth to approximately eighteen months of age. Toddlers then move across to 'The Nursery,' where they remain until approximately three years of age. From there, children transition to the Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 1 (the Preschool) situated on a different site, until they begin school. The two centres share a philosophy, which emphasises Christian values and equitable provision for all families.</p><p>Management and leadership roles have recently been restructured. A centre manager now guides teaching and learning across both centres. The owner supports administration and finance, and the oversight of centre systems and professional learning. Teachers represent a diverse range of cultures and experience. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>The March 2017 ERO report identified a number of areas requiring further development. These included: culturally responsive practices; appraisal and assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Good progress is evident in these areas. Internal evaluation remains a priority for improvement.</p><p>This review was one part of two in the Life-Start Early Learning Centres Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and explore in a calm environment. Interactions are warm and respectful. The Christian character of the service is well reflected in routines and the environment. <span lang="mi">Te reo MƒÅori</span> and Pacific languages are heard regularly, supporting oral language development of MƒÅori and Pacific children, and promoting their sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers show an understanding of appropriate learning experiences for infants and toddlers. Opportunities for sensory exploration and physical challenge are prioritised. Teachers are highly responsive to young children's verbal and non-verbal communication. Infants are offered choices about their day and play. Unhurried care routines are flexible to their preferences.</p><p>Toddlers benefit from effective support for their growing social competence. They demonstrate respect for others, the environment and resources. Teachers should consider how daily routine times for toddlers, for example moving between play and meals, could be better managed to foster a consistently engaging programme.</p><p>There are well-considered processes in place for transitions into the service and between age groups. Useful reciprocal information-sharing with parents supports consistency of care between the service and home.</p><p>Good quality, regular assessments capture clear evidence of children's progress. To add value to documentation, teachers should include the strategies they have used to extend children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that internal evaluation practices have not been sufficiently prioritised. The service must ensure that they regularly engage with internal evaluation to monitor outcomes for children and continually improve centre practices. Some work has begun in this area.</p><p>Recently restructured leadership roles are currently being embedded. Management are improvement focused and committed to the sustainability of the centre for the benefit of families. Leaders actively build on the expertise and interests of teachers and develop leadership across the Life-Start centres. Appraisal processes are well used to encourage teachers to research and reflect on the effectiveness of their practice. A next step for leaders is to better streamline processes and prioritise developments, to ensure improvements in key areas.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for development are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving daily transition times in the toddler section to ensure that they meet the needs of these children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting of teaching strategies that are used to extend children's play within assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building internal evaluation capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, leaders should focus on embedding the new leadership structure.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Life-Start Learning Centres Ltd 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety and governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>when children leave the premises on an excursion, appropriate assessment and management of risk is undertaken and documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging in ongoing review and evaluation to maintain and improve the quality of education and care.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17, GMA6.</em></p><p>Since the onsite phase of the review, the service has taken steps to improve their excursion and risk management processes.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>25 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
