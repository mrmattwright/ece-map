</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mosgiel Playcentre is one of 47 playcentres within the New Zealand Playcentre Federation's newly-formed South Island Southern Region (SISR). It is open five mornings a week. Up to 25 children from birth-to-school age attend, mostly with their parents. The playcentre has close links with the adjacent primary school.</p><p>The daily sessions are led by a qualified educator and parents. Some families have been involved in the playcentre for a long time and some have educational backgrounds. A parent committee oversees the operation of the playcentre. Some members are very experienced in their roles.</p><p>In 2017, the playcentre was supported by a centre advisor, with occasional visits and frequent communication from the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). In 2018, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation restructured the association. The playcentre now has regular visits and ongoing support from a centre support worker and a paid administrator. Playcentre representatives meet regularly with a cluster of other local playcentres to share and improve practices.</p><p>Mosgiel Playcentre's philosophy emphasises that the centre is a family-like community where parents learn and grow alongside their children. It states that children learn best in a mixed-age, safe, fun place, with a high adult-to-child ratio. It emphasises the importance of child-led, uninterrupted play and celebrating people's uniqueness. This philosophy was very evident in the playcentre practices, programme and interactions during the onsite stage of the review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the SISR playcentres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging to their playcentre. They confidently choose and direct their play and learning. They play well alongside and with each other and show sustained interest in what they are doing.</p><p>Children are very well supported by affirming and caring relationships. Adults know the children very well as individuals and as learners and know their families. This means that adults are very responsive to children's interests and make links between centre and home life in their play. Adults use incidental opportunities well, to challenge and extend children's language and learning.</p><p>The playcentre is very well resourced. Resources are well organised, readily accessible to children and invitingly presented. Adults have ensured that there are safe areas and resources appropriate for infants and toddlers, as well as resources to challenge and extend older children.</p><p>The quality of individual and group planning has improved since the last ERO review. Individual goals often focus on recognising and developing positive dispositions. Learning stories often link back to children's goals and increasingly describe the relevant learning. The present group plan, about caring for one's self, others and the environment, has been extended to increase the depth of learning. Linked to group plans, children enjoy a wide range of interesting experiences and activities. This includes regular trips, with a learning focus, into the local and wider community.</p><p>Consistent with the philosophy, the playcentre provides important support and learning for the adults. Parents assist each other in their role as children's first teacher, and provide extra support for families at times of need.</p><p>The playcentre is well managed and governed. Committee members have clear roles and responsibilities and follow sound governance practices. Adults are very reflective and show a strong commitment to providing the best for their children. Regular self review informs ongoing improvements.</p><p>At the time of this review, the Otago Playcentre Association had transitioned to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation's new operating model. It has amalgamated with Southland and South Canterbury Playcentre Associations to become the South Island Southern Region. While the changes led to some disruption of the services provided to individual playcentres, the OPA effectively managed the restructure with the resources available to it. Each playcentre now receives regular support from a paid administrator and a centre support worker. There are robust systems in the association for monitoring the progress and performance of individual playcentres, and targeted support is given when needed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Mosgiel Playcentre and ERO have identified that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>promote parent participation in the newly-developed playcentre qualifications</li>
<li>strengthen te ao and te reo MƒÅori in the day-to-day programme</li>
<li>clarify the centre's priorities for children's learning</li>
<li>identify key strategic priorities and develop a useful strategic plan to guide centre direction.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mosgiel Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mosgiel Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>18 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
