</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aynsley Street Preschool is a privately owned early learning centre. The service's programme is based on the Montessori philosophy. It has two separate areas that provide full-day education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. The service is licensed for up to 33 children, including 8 under the age of two. Two fully registered teachers lead the service, and other staff are working towards full registration or in training.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, there has been a new owner and new staff have been appointed. Leadership of the centre includes the owner, who is the director, the centre's manager who also has responsibility for the infants and toddlers, and the supervisor who is responsible for the older children.</p><p>The new owner has responded to the areas for further improvement identified in the previous ERO report relating to expectations for teaching and learning, and internal review. She has strengthened leadership and built a positive staff culture of teamwork and continuous improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new director and the leadership team at Anysley Street Preschool have a strong commitment to high quality teaching and learning. They have a shared understanding and clear vision for the philosophy to be implemented in this service. These high expectations are lifting teacher practice and promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers engage in responsive, reciprocal relationships with children and their parents or whānau. Teachers use conversations with and observations of children to know children's interests and help children lead their own learning. </p><p>Montessori values are to the forefront of much of the teaching and learning. A strong emphasis on respect is evident. Routines are well established so children know what is expected and how they should respond. The environment and resources encourage exploration, positive interactions and fun. Infants and toddlers benefit from caring relationships with their teachers. Teachers have established a calm, slow pace where there is ample time to meet the needs of the children.</p><p>The staff are responsive to the needs of families and whānau, and are welcoming and engaging. They take care to understand the child in the context of the family. Teachers build on their knowledge of each child to prepare well-documented individual plans. Plans are supported by profile stories which show good evidence of next steps and feedback from parents and whānau.</p><p>There is trust and mutual respect in the leadership group. After a very large turnover of staff with the arrival of the new director, there has been a concerted effort to build stronger working relationships within the teaching team. The leaders have provided very good guidance for staff on the quality expected in their teaching. Leaders support teachers well in their reflective practice and for the evaluation of the impact of their teaching.</p><p>The director is committed to promoting bicultural practices to support tamariki and their whānau. The centre's purpose includes ensuring all children experience aspects of Aotearoa New Zealand's bicultural heritage. The next step is ensure greater consistency of teachers' practice in promoting bicultural aspects for Māori children and for all children.</p><p>The director has put major work into building sustainable governance practices. There has been significant progress since the change of ownership. The director and leadership team have supported this by creating a culture where each child and whānau is able to feel well included and experience success. The director has provided a large number of resources to support staff and for the ongoing development of the centre. The strategic plan gives clear direction.</p><p>A next step would be to ensure that the strategic plan shows clear links to expected outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the quality and consistency of teachers' practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa is evident in the action planning to support the strategic goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen and embed internal evaluation at all levels of service operation, including the leadership team.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aynsley Street Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aynsley Street Preschool Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>27 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
