</table><p>Creators@Home-Nelson¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creators @ Home-Nelson is part of a national service that provides care and education for children from birth to school age in the educarer's own home. The national service covers a wide geographical area including Nelson, Marlborough and the West Coast.</p><p>Prior to 2014, the service was known as Footsteps Education Ltd Nelson, Marlborough and West Coast. The November 2013 ERO report of the Footsteps service, identified a range of practices requiring further development. Creators Education Trust worked in consultation with the Ministry of Education to meet full licensing conditions for all of its home-based services.</p><p>A national coordinator has oversight of all Creators @ Home early learning services. In the home-based services, regional leaders are responsible for managing the work of the visiting teachers. In this network, one visiting teacher and the regional leader work together to support in-home educarers to provide suitable care and learning programmes for children.</p><p>Three models of support are in place: 'At Home', where educarers care for children in private homes; 'Awhi' for caregivers of children under shared guardianship with Oranga Tamariki; and 'Awhi WhƒÅnau' for whƒÅnau caring for the children of family members. The children in this network are supported by the ‚ÄòAwhi‚Äô model and the 'At Home' programme.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is based on the Reggio Emilia approach where positive relationships are promoted and children are at the forefront of learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four home-based education and care network reviews in the Creators @ Home service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The experienced regional leader and visiting teacher foster respectful, reciprocal, trusting relationships with educarers, caregivers and whƒÅnau to promote the wellbeing and learning of children. Educarers and caregivers are well supported to grow a deeper understanding of the differing identity and experiences of children, particularly those with diverse needs and changing circumstances.</p><p>The interests, needs and capabilities of each child are well considered and valued in the collaborative planning approach to their learning. Children‚Äôs learning records highlight the curriculum which is responsive to the skills and dispositions of infants, toddlers and young children. There is evidence of an increasing commitment to developing the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the home learning environments.</p><p>Visiting teachers support educarers and caregivers to recognise the importance of establishing routines that create a secure foundation, particularly for infants and toddlers. They encourage ongoing developments in practice to promote the service philosophy and the value and importance of children learning through play.</p><p>The regional leader and visiting teacher advocate strongly for children and families and work closely with external expertise when needed. The service provides appropriate professional development and mentoring to build educator confidence, teacher capability and leadership capacity. The regional leader and visiting teacher encourage a reflective culture that is focused on ongoing improvement and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the national leaders of the service agree that the key next steps to strengthen governance processes and practices are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give prominence to bicultural perspectives in key guiding documentation and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a robust strategic approach to promote educational success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine, develop and evaluate strategic and annual action planning of key service and regional priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop new performance management and appraisal systems to ensure full understanding and alignment to the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the national and regional leaders of the service agree that the key next steps for the network are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop educarer and caregiver understandings of Te WhƒÅriki (2017) The Early Childhood Curriculum to strengthen assessment of and for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop self-review practices to promote deeper levels of inquiry and internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Compliance Actions</h3><p>The national and regional leaders must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>appraisal processes and practices for teachers align to the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand requirements</li>
<li>sleep records document regular checks on sleeping children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creators@Home-Nelson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>16 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a><a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"></a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
