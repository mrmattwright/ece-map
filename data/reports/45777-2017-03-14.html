</table><p>Requires further development</p><p>Bright Horizons- Matamata requires further development because the governance and management has not provided clear direction to inform the centre's vision, philosophy, policy and practices.</p><p>ERO has also identified a number of non-compliances in relation to key policies, and health and safety. The previous policy review process occurred in 2015, and therefore some policies do not reflect the recent changes to regulatory requirements. In addition, centre leadership has not been effective in building teacher capability to bring about improvement to the quality of self review, assessment, planning and evaluation of the curriculum.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Horizons is located in a residential area close to the business district in Matamata. The centre is one of two centres that are owned and governed by Bright Horizons New Zealand Childcare Ltd, an Australian owned private company. The purpose built centre provides all day education and care for children from three months to five years. It is licensed for 75 children including up to 25 children aged under two. At the time of this ERO review there were 36 children on the roll including nine children who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre has four separate age-based rooms. Currently only two rooms are being used, one for infants and toddlers, and another preschool room for children over the age of two. There is also an after school/holiday care facility on the premises using one of the classrooms.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014 there has been significant staff changes, including new centre directors. The staffing has now stabilised with the appointment of an acting Head Teacher in the preschool room, and a new Centre Director has been appointed in January 2017. The centre has not made significant progress in improving planning, assessment and evaluation practices and processes, as was identified in the last ERO review.</p><p>The centre's philosophy specifies that the environment and culture is inclusive and welcoming, and there is a focus on building reciprocal relationships through trust, empowerment and respect.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a child-led, play-based programme that reflects <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and the aspirations of the centre philosophy. Children benefit from teachers who are deliberate in their practice and promote positive relationships that are responsive and engaged. Children up to age of two years enjoy supportive and nurturing relationships with their teachers. Their needs are well met and the programme considers parent's aspirations and routines from home. The centre has an inclusive approach to supporting children with learning and behaviour needs. These practices contribute to the centre's unhurried and calm responsive programme, which promotes opportunities for all children to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>persue their own interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experience a language rich environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop their confidence and competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>choose their learning and take responsibility for their own behaviour.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The environment reflects a purposeful curriculum where children experience opportunities for learning in a well-resourced centre. Teachers ensure that routines are focused on the child and support natural rhythms and needs through deliberate and purposeful interactions. The outside learning space is large, and well planned allo wing children to experience challenge and risks as they develop their gross motor skills.</p><p>The recently appointed centre director is providing effective leadership for the centre. Although she has identified significant areas for review and development that require urgent attention, her current priority is to develop positive and respectful relationships with teachers, children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for this centre are to develop key leadership and governance capabilities. Particular priority needs to be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a current and purposeful three year strategic plan that outlines direction and provides the basis for the monitoring centre development and ongoing self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre philosophy so that it is relevant to new teachers and leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and strengthening teachers' appraisal processes and systems to effectively build teacher capability and leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a teacher registration policy that will support and guide all teachers through the registration process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional learning about planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing effective self-review practices and procedures to strategically guide centre improvement</p>
</li>
<li>implementing a bicultural curriculum where children's language, culture and identity is evident in the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Horizons Matamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management policies and procedures. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update current policies and procedures to align to current regulatory requirements, including teacher registration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen reporting and quality assurance systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in strategic plan, which promotes ongoing improvement particularly in relation to self-review and internal evaluation.</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
