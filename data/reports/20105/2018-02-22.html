</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Meadowbank Plunket Preschool is a community-based not-for-profit centre that operates as part of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (RNZPS). It is licensed for 20 children between two and five years of age. Children can attend six hour days or full days.</p><p>The vision for the centre is to encourage and support children to become independent learners. Underpinning this vision is a focus on partnerships with whānau. Children are viewed as individual and unique learners.</p><p>Since the centre's 2014 ERO review, there have been significant changes at the governance level. An early childhood national manager and national board have been appointed. The fully qualified centre manager has been in the role throughout this period. She is supported by two qualified teachers plus one unqualified teacher.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified the need to strengthen bicultural practices, embed internal evaluation processes and access further professional development for staff. Very good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and independent learners. They have a strong sense of belonging and ownership of their environment. Children settle quickly when arriving for their day. They engage in activities that interest them, and are very well supported by teachers. Children are encouraged to follow their curiosities and develop their own working theories about the world. The newly developed outside area provides opportunities for creative, imaginative and physical challenge for children.</p><p>Teachers genuinely listen to children. They engage children in conversations that help them to develop their understanding, oral language and communication skills. Leaders and teachers work in partnership with parents and whānau of children to enhance their wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Teachers provide a high quality curriculum that is well designed and responsive to individual children's interests, strengths and abilities. They recognise the value and importance of children learning through play. Children are provided with a variety of ways to be creative and imaginative in order to enhance learning and independence. Learning in core curriculum areas, such as mathematics, is enriched through meaningful and interesting opportunities. Children have access to a range of high quality resources to encourage and extend their learning.</p><p>Children and teachers have fun as part of the learning process. Teachers empower children to take responsibility for their wellbeing and that of others and their environment. Assessment information is used well to plan individual children's learning pathways.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective and efficient. The head teacher has a strong commitment to continuous improvement. She promotes a shared understanding of the centre's philosophy, vision and goals among the teaching team. Internal evaluation is used well to consider implications for teaching practices, and promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers have identified appropriate next steps to maintain the high quality programme provided for children. These include involving children in setting learning goals and continuing to strengthen bicultural practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Meadowbank Plunket Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Meadowbank Plunket Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>22 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
