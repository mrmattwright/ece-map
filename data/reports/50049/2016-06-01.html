</table><p>Centre leaders and teaching staff have some improvements to make to continue to raise the quality of education and care provided to children and their families.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Early Learning Centre is a privately owned centre located in Petone. It is licensed for 20 children aged over two years. At the time of this review 27 children attended, four of whom identify as MƒÅori. Teachers and managers are long serving.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs January 2013 review, identified that self review, appraisal and strategic planning required further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm and responsive to children and their families. Children play cooperatively with their peers and at times engage in sustained play. Teachers need to ensure that they maximise opportunities to add challenge and complexity to children‚Äôs learning. A key next step is for teachers to take a more purposeful approach in their interactions with children to deepen their learning.</p><p>Leaders should support teachers to develop a shared understanding of the expectations of the centre‚Äôs positive guidance policy to encourage children to negotiate solutions to their problems and assist their developing social competence.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes, including group planning require development to:</p><ul>
<li>streamline the planning process</li>
<li>reflect children‚Äôs interests and strengths to enable a more responsive curriculum</li>
<li>more closely evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum and its impact on children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>Planning individualised programmes for children in partnership with their parents is strongly promoted in the centre. Teachers provide parents with regular summaries of what their child is interested and participating in. These are discussed at planned parent, teacher meetings where learning goals are set and reflected in the child‚Äôs individual portfolio. This approach should be strengthened through leaders and teachers further developing their understanding of the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation. Once achieved, teachers should reflect this emphasis through the planned and enacted curriculum.</p><p>A daily structured group time is offered for four year old children. Further developing teachers‚Äô understanding of current research and best practice, including developing an understanding of the links between <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum,</em> should assist teachers to enhance transition to school for these children.</p><p>The teaching team is committed to the development of the bicultural programme. Teachers are beginning to consider how the curriculum can reflect a MƒÅori worldview. Leaders and teachers should continue to use te reo MƒÅori with children and be proactive in their approach to integrating aspects of te ao MƒÅori throughout the curriculum and supporting documentation.</p><p>Leaders should further develop their understanding of how to effectively promote educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children through ongoing consideration of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners, Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> and the<em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013 - 2017.</em></p><p>Parents are regularly consulted about aspects of the early childhood curriculum. Leaders should clearly identify actions deemed necessary from this consultation. The documented process should be updated to reflect this.</p><p>A useful appraisal process supports teachers‚Äô ongoing development. Feedback is evident. Establishing an appraisal policy to clearly identify the responsibilities of both parties is a next step.</p><p>Relevant documentation has been amended to reflect the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children‚Äôs Act 2014.</em></p><p>Using internal evaluation to judge the impact of the programme on children‚Äôs learning, needs strengthening. This should support teachers‚Äô to shift their focus from reviewing if the centre is doing something, to evaluating how well they are doing it.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to further support:</p><ul>
<li>teachers to be more purposeful in their interactions with children to deepen learning</li>
<li>children‚Äôs social competence and their readiness for school</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô understanding of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle</li>
<li>development of the bicultural programme and explore how success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori and success for Pacific children can be promoted</li>
<li>internal evaluation and assist teachers to implement it.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice, leaders should further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflection of te ao MƒÅori in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent support for children‚Äôs developing social competence.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of this review leaders and teachers have developed:</p><ul>
<li>practice to consistently follow the systems and processes that have been established to monitor health and safety requirements</li>
<li>an appraisal policy.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3><a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">Review Coverage</a></h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
