</table><p>Ranui Kindergarten (Invercargill)¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ranui Kindergarten (Invercargill) provides early childhood education for children over two years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children. Children participate in learning programmes from 8:30am to 2:30pm.</p><p>The kindergarten vision is to 'challenge and support tamariki to enable them to be lifelong learners'. It includes a commitment to a Treaty of Waitangi-based curriculum, and engaging whƒÅnau to be actively involved in maintaining and cherishing the culture of the kindergarten.</p><p>The philosophy sets out what learning is important for children at this kindergarten. This learning is focused on MƒÅori concepts including: kaitiakitanga (taking care of our world), hauora (health in mind, body and spirit), ukaipotanga (a place where we belong) and whanaungatanga (looking for the best in others).</p><p>Ranui Kindergarten is one of 23 kindergartens administered by Kindergartens South (KS). The general manager oversees each kindergarten within the association under the governance of a board. Senior Teachers provide ongoing professional advice, guidance and support to each kindergarten. The day-to-day operation of Ranui Kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by two qualified early childhood teachers and a teacher's aide.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2015, the teachers have made very good progress in deepening assessment, planning and evaluation practices for individuals and groups of children.</p><p>This review was part of two reviews in the Kindergarten South Association (KS).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging to Ranui Kindergarten. They are active learners and are confident to offer ideas and seek help from kaiako. Children learn skills to help them to respect and care for themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>The teachers have a strong focus on ensuring all children and their whƒÅnau experience success. Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers and staff work effectively with children, their whƒÅnau and sometimes with the support of external agencies, to develop specific programmes designed to help children learn and progress.</p><p>The teachers value all children's language, culture and identity. This is evident in the environment and programmes provided. Children learn and play alongside each other in programmes that are founded on MƒÅori values and principles, and that are aligned to the kindergarten's desired outcomes for children's learning. Pacific children's culture and language are acknowledged, celebrated and incorporated into programmes for children's learning. A next step is to ensure that assessment for learning for all children consistently shows how teachers respond to their language, culture and identity.</p><p>Teachers know the children well and know how to respond to help them learn. Teachers are knowledgeable about and able to try alternative ways to support and progress children's learning and development. They are skilful and use a wide range of strategies to support children to play well together and develop friendships. Teachers seek children's ideas and authentically incorporate them into the learning programmes. They provide opportunities for children to experience leadership.</p><p>This kindergarten's philosophy reflects a number of the strands and learning outcomes of Te WhƒÅriki, The NZ Early Childhood curriculum, with a strong focus on wellbeing, belonging and contribution. The strands of communication and exploration are not explicit. The philosophy could be strengthened to include other important learning and then used to evaluate the provision of programmes to support that learning.</p><p>Teachers have developed useful assessment for learning and planning systems for individual and groups of children. Assessment for learning identifies children's strengths, interests, needs and learning progress. Group planning to support the desired outcomes for learning is deliberate and well aligned to the kindergarten philosophy. The best examples of planning show how teachers plan deliberate strategies to support children's learning and then evaluate these strategies. This evaluative practice needs to be implemented consistently for both individual and group planning.</p><p>Teachers use internal evaluation to identify what is going well and what they need to improve to promote positive outcomes for children. They effectively use the appraisal process, including professional development, as ways to improve their own understanding and knowledge about teaching and learning.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2017 reviews of kindergartens in KS, there have been significant changes within the association management and leadership team. Many of the good practices in place to support the kindergartens have been sustained. However, ERO found that the board needs better information to know how well kindergartens are improving outcomes for children. The board also needs to review its own performance and review the roles and responsibilities within the association leadership and management team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>For the association:</p><p>The association and board have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children is to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop the vision, values, philosophy and goals to better reflect the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and te ao MƒÅori perspectives</li>
<li>ensure that reporting and monitoring at all levels is evaluative and shows how outcomes for children have been improved, especially for priority learners and in relation to the association‚Äôs valued outcomes, vision and philosophy</li>
<li>ensure there is a clear process for consulting with all parents and whƒÅnau MƒÅori within the association</li>
<li>monitor the effectiveness of new initiatives</li>
<li>review the roles and responsibilities of leadership positions within the association and review the performance and effectiveness of the board</li>
<li>review and update the complaints policy and procedures.</li>
</ul><p>For the kindergarten:</p><p>ERO has identified that the next steps to promote positive outcomes for all children are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>refine the philosophy and aspects of programme design</li>
<li>consistently evaluate the effectiveness and impact of teaching strategies on children's learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ranui Kindergarten (Invercargill) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>5 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
