</table><p>Lincoln University Childcare and Preschool is w<em>ell placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This childcare and preschool service now operates as part of Lincoln University rather than being run by a Trust. It provides education and care for children of university staff and students, as well as other children from the local community.</p><p>The centre is open from 8.00 am to 5.30 pm. It has two separate programmes, one for children under two years old and the other for children over two.</p><p>The children at the centre come from a variety of cultures. This cultural diversity enriches children‚Äôs learning as aspects of biculturalism and multiculturalism are integrated into the centre‚Äôs programme and practices.</p><p>Since the centre‚Äôs December 2011 ERO review, the manager and teachers have successfully retained and built on the areas of progress noted at that time. They have made good progress towards addressing areas for improvement, in particular with assessment and planning and the quality of interactions.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides children with a positive, supportive and inclusive learning environment that successfully fosters their sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>This positive environment is promoted through:</p><ul>
<li>staff being observant and responsive to children‚Äôs needs, strengths and interests</li>
<li>warm, caring and respectful relationships between staff and children</li>
<li>positive relationships among children that promote cooperative play</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô good relationships with children‚Äôs parents and whƒÅnau.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers consistently use many practices that successfully promote children‚Äôs learning and development. These practices include:</p><ul>
<li>interactions that support and extend children‚Äôs thinking and their active involvement in exploratory play for sustained periods</li>
<li>the effective use of the centre‚Äôs facilities and extensive resources to extend and enrich children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>good-quality individual assessment and planning that helps teachers respond to and build on children‚Äôs interest and strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Ongoing improvements to the centre programmes are providing children with a rich and varied range of activities and learning opportunities. Features of these programmes include the:</p><ul>
<li>extent to which they are based on children‚Äôs emerging interests</li>
<li>way literacy and mathematics are an integrated part of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>range of learning opportunities provided within and beyond the centre</li>
<li>emphasis placed on learning about the environment and sustainable practices.</li>
</ul><p>For children under two years of age the centre provides a calm environment, unhurried routines and staff who are sensitive and responsive to children‚Äôs immediate needs. The centre gives good support to children with special needs. Staff acknowledge and actively affirm children‚Äôs cultural identity.</p><p>The service provider, manager and staff are successfully promoting ongoing improvements to the quality of care and education for children. These improvements are being fostered through:</p><ul>
<li>a shared and well-understood centre philosophy and priorities</li>
<li>the way the manager uses teacher strengths and interests to benefit children and other staff</li>
<li>professional development and increasing contact with other early childhood leaders and professionals</li>
<li>well-established processes for undertaking regular self reviews.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>explore further ways of involving parents in their child‚Äôs assessments and individual plans</li>
<li>improve the planning and evaluation of group programmes</li>
<li>give higher priority to evaluating the quality of teaching practices and programmes in their planned cycle of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The service provider and manager should extend provisions for building sustainable management practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lincoln University Childcare and Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lincoln University Childcare and Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>8 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
