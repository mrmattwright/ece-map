</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Abbey's Place Childcare Centre is located in central Putaruru. It is one of two centres under the same private ownership. The service is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 28 children, including eight under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review there were 27 on the roll, including 17 MƒÅori children, most of whom whakapapa to NgƒÅti Raukawa. Leadership has remained constant since the 2015 ERO review. The majority of teachers in the centre are qualified, and three are completing their provisional registration. An effective appraisal process and support for the provisionally registered teachers is in place. The recently reviewed philosophy aims to provide an inclusive service with a focus on free play in a culturally responsive environment.</p><p>The service has a poor ERO reporting history.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified the urgent need to improve:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>centre resources.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO identified a non-compliance in relation to the provision of sufficient resources for children's learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Some progress is evident as the centre manager continues to develop systems and practices for centre organisation. Regular management reports to governance have been established. These need to be further strengthened to document the response to matters identified. Whilst some improvements to operating systems have been made, there remains an urgent need for management and leaders to set high expectations for teaching practice, centre presentation, and programme implementation, particularly for older children.</p><p>Recent and relevant professional development from the Ministry of Education (MoE) has resulted in more flexible routines and teachers positively managing children's behaviour. Teachers have also benefited from external support in assessing, planning and evaluating children's learning. Bicultural practice has been strengthened with one teacher showing emerging leadership in this area.</p><p>Transitions into, and from, the centre are well supported and the centre manager has built links with the local school and leads a cluster of early childhood teachers in the area. Children with additional learning needs benefit from an inclusive learning culture and external support is accessed when required. Parent participation and positive contribution in the life of the centre are evident.</p><p>The progress that has occurred to date is yet to fully impact on positive outcomes for children. Many aspects of centre operation continue to be of concern. ERO is not confident that the centre can meet and sustain expectations for a quality service. Significant, ongoing support from the MoE is urgently required.</p><p>As identified in previous ERO reports, there remains an urgent need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve governance in relation to self-review, strategic direction, health and safety management and capacity building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen centre leadership in building and supporting professional practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raise the quality of teaching practice, including interactions with children, to align with current theories of learning, teaching and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take a more planned approach to curriculum design and implementation to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO also identified a significant number of non-compliant practices that require immediate action to ensure the centre meets safety and regulatory requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the provision of sufficient quantity and variety of indoor and outdoor equipment and materials appropriate to the learning and abilities of children attending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>storage and access to equipment and materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the provision of a warm, dry sleep room for children, and bedding appropriately covering mattresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children accessing the kitchen and laundry areas without adult supervision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>securing heavy objects that might fall in an earthquake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arranging cots and stacker beds so that adults have clear access to the length of cots and the area around each child allows sufficient air movement to minimise the risk of spreading illness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying and removing hazards to children daily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting evidence of daily parental acknowledgement of medicine having been administered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher interactions with children that extend their learning, thinking and development and using resources in purposeful, meaningful ways.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF4, PF8, PF12, PF14, PF31, HS6, HS10, HS12, HS28, C9]</em></p><p>In order to improve practice, teachers need to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>water at the base of the metal slide is drained, dried and cleared before children arrive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teats on babies bottles on the kitchen bench and stored in the fridge are covered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dummies are stored in individual containers in the fridge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>toilet floors are regularly checked and kept clean and dry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children arrive to a well prepared and presented indoor and outdoor environment and areas are kept attractive and refreshed throughout the day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fire exit sign is replaced in the sleep room.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>4 September 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
