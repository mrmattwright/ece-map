</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jack and Jill Educare is a privately owned centre located in purpose-built facilities in central Hamilton. The centre provides all-day education and care for children from three months to school age in three age-based rooms. The licence was changed early in 2016, to allow 75 children to attend, including a maximum of 25 under the age of two. The roll at the time of this ERO review was 75, with 7 children identified as Māori and 7 as Indian.</p><p>The current service provider took over ownership and governance of the centre in 2014. Recent property upgrades have involved the outdoor play areas in the over-two rooms. The centre manager was appointed in late 2014, and has responsibility for professional leadership and day-to-day operations. She reports regularly to the service provider and works closely with him to provide positive direction for the centre and its community. A high proportion of the teachers are fully qualified and have given many years of service to the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy gives emphasis to establishing a warm, inclusive and nurturing environment, and to supporting children to become confident and competent learners. The under two section has adapted a philosophy based on deep respect as they care for and support these young children.</p><p>The service provider and centre leaders have responded positively to recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. Strategic planning is now more detailed and linked to self-review processes. The expectations of, and support for, teaching practice have been strengthened. Staff are continuing to develop confidence and competence in te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported by teachers to be highly engaged in meaningful play. Relationships in the centre community are based on mutual respect, and teachers use positive guidance strategies to foster children's social competencies. Routines promote self-management skills and are efficiently organised to ensure minimal interruptions to play. Teachers know children and their families very well, and affirm their identity and culture. Children are developing confidence and a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Babies and toddlers in the under two area are able to play and explore in a settled, nurturing and calm environment. Close and trusting communications with parents ensures these children's routines are consistent with home experiences. The babies and toddlers have their own spacious outdoor play that allows for physical challenge and a broad range of play experiences.</p><p>The centre programme is well designed with reference to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. This curriculum provides a wide range of meaningful and interesting learning experiences for children. Play areas are open and spacious, and allow children to make choices about activities to engage in on their own, or with others. The programme benefits from the continuity, stability and experience of teachers who notice, recognise and respond to each child's interests and strengths, and make considered judgements as to when to support or extend their play. The programme is a balance of emergent or responsive planning and current 'themes'. Each of the three areas has an age-appropriate programme, and there is an activity-based programme to help a group of 4 year old children prepare for school. Transitions into, within and from the centre are sensitively managed with children and families.</p><p>High levels of oral language and communication skills are evident in teacher interactions with children. Literacy and mathematics concepts are skilfully integrated into the programme. Children have opportunities for dramatic, creative and artistic experiences. Teachers prepare well-presented assessment portfolios, which record each child's participation in the centre programme, and help to build their identity as successful learners. The centre has an appropriate level of resourcing for younger children in most of its play areas. However, centre leaders and teachers recognise the need for a strategic review of resourcing, including their ongoing accessibility, especially for older children.</p><p>The leadership of the centre manager is considered and collaborative. She sets high standards for professional practice while effectively empowering and encouraging staff to contribute to decision making. Performance management systems have been reviewed and strengthened to incorporate teacher reflection on practice. Recent self review has included a focus on 'healthy hearts' and resulted in the employment of a new cook. The outcome of the new focus has resulted in healthier menus, physical activity, and new policies and practices. Centre leaders are effectively building the capacity of professional staff to promote positive outcomes for children and their families/whānau.</p><p>Centre governance effectively promotes positive learning outcomes for all children. The service provider models enthusiasm and passion for providing high quality care and education. Open and regular communication with families/whānau creates trust and confidence, and fosters a sense of inclusion in this multi-cultural community. The service provider sets high professional expectations and strongly affirms and supports his staff. Professional development for teachers is well supported. Children are benefitting from the continuous improvement in practice and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and centre manager agree that a strategic review of resourcing and accessibility, especially for older children, is the important next step for this centre. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jack and Jill Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jack and Jill Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>23 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
