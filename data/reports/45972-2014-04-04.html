</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eduplay Childcare in Ellerslie opened in July 2012, and is licensed for fifty-nine children. The centre is governed by Edupac Childcare Limited. The centre‚Äôs philosophy is to provide a balance of education and play and to recognise each child as an individual. The mission is to provide positive outcomes for children through education and play.</p><p>Up to thirty infants and toddlers are cared for in the nursery. At about two years of age they are moved to the larger play room. There is a good flow between these rooms and between the outdoor play areas where the older and younger children are often able to play together. The centre layout supports the family atmosphere of the centre.</p><p>The centre is situated on a sloping section with the outdoor play areas arranged on three levels. This terracing provides interesting play areas and there are large trees for shade. Strategies are in place to manage the supervision of these spaces.</p><p>The owner, centre manager and head teacher work with an administrator and seven registered teachers. One of these teachers is fully registered and four additional staff are working towards full registration. The centre employs a cook and provides healthy meals for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs play is valued by teachers and parents and children have good opportunities to be creative and explore. They are well engaged in their play and learning and experience positive interactions and caring relationships with adults. Children of various ages come together regularly to play together in different play areas. Teachers extend children‚Äôs conversations and engage them in discussing their play and learning.</p><p>Play areas are interesting and varied. Teachers manage the flow of children‚Äôs learning well through the day and smooth transitions are made between activities and play areas. Natural and regular use of te reo, waiata, karakia, and a focus on MƒÅori myths and legends, are evident in the learning programme.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum is strongly based on teachers‚Äô professional knowledge, early childhood education theory, self review and fostering positive outcomes for children. Links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are clearly identified in curriculum planning. Children‚Äôs learning stories show their dispositions for learning are developing and sometimes include parents‚Äô contributions.</p><p>Managers are committed to building a high quality service for children. Useful management processes are in place, as are good, planned processes for self review. Parents have opportunities to contribute to the centre‚Äôs self review and staff use a variety of ways to communicate with whƒÅnau. Managers support ongoing teacher professional development and encourage teachers to take leadership in reviewing centre practices and projects of interest. The manager reports monthly to the board of directors and a comprehensive policy framework supports the strategic vision and direction for the centre.</p><p>As the centre has been open for only eighteen months, management and teaching practices in the centre continue to develop. Good foundations are in place to support ongoing sustainability and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue improving teaching practices and learning outcomes for children, the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>provide whole-centre professional development to support better use of assessment for planning purposes</li>
<li>focus evaluation more clearly on children‚Äôs learning outcomes and strengthen critique of teaching practice</li>
<li>consider ways to recognise and celebrate children‚Äôs cultures and home languages in their portfolios</li>
<li>increase support for literacy and numeracy learning throughout the environment and the programme</li>
<li>extend the provision of resources, both in the nursery and for older children, to provide challenge and to enable children to make independent decisions about their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eduplay Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Eduplay Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
