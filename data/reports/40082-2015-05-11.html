</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mamaku Playcentre is a parent-led service that provides education and care for children from birth to school age. Located in the village of Mamaku near Rotorua, the centre operates three morning sessions each week. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including 15 under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review the centre‚Äôs roll of 19 included 13 children of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review there have been significant developments of the centre‚Äôs building programme including establishing a covered verandah area, a new dining space, as well as refurbishing the kitchen, bathroom and office areas. There has also been further development of the centre‚Äôs playgrounds.</p><p>The centre has experienced a recent growth in its roll. On the day that ERO attended the centre three new families were visiting with a view to enrolling their children. Leadership of the centre has remained the same and more members are committing themselves to undertaking playcentre training.</p><p>Mamaku Playcentre operates under the umbrella of Rotorua Playcentre Association, which acts as its governing body. The association strongly endorses playcentre philosophy, and aims to empower parents to be the first and best educators of their children. It expects that parents will act as volunteer leaders and managers for their playcentre. The association employs staff to provide centre parents with guidance and support. The knowledgeable operations manager is readily available to assist with information, and an experienced Centre Support Officer attends playcentre sessions and meetings to advise and mentor members. The association receives reports from the Centre Support Officer and the centre that provide assurance of compliance with licensing, health and safety and other operational requirements.</p><p>Playcentres offer a recognised adult education qualification, designed to assist parents to provide appropriate learning opportunities for their children. The association offers training towards this qualification for all members. In addition, the association recently provided professional development through a Ministry of Education contract. An experienced tutor assisted the association and its centres to use self review to promote and evaluate the organisation‚Äôs strategic goals.</p><p>Through its strategic plan, the association provides a framework for centres to set their development goals. These relate to their Te Tiriti o Waitangi commitment, the vibrancy of their communities of learning, their recognition in the wider community, and their sustainable future.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Rotorua Playcentre Assocation</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Mamaku Playcentre continues to provide a valuable service for the whƒÅnau and children of the Mamaku community.</p><p>Children enjoy participating in the child-initiated programme. They have access to a wide range of good-quality resources and equipment. Particular features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>regular trips into the local and wider community</li>
<li>the natural integration of literacy and mathematics learning through children‚Äôs play</li>
<li>celebration of significant events for children and the community.</li>
</ul><p>The recently renovated indoor area provides spacious play areas for children and comfortable facilities for adults. There are many opportunities for children to explore and experience safe physical challenge in the extensive, well-maintained and presented outdoor play areas.</p><p>The centre has well-established relationships with Mamaku School that support children and their families as they transition to school. MƒÅori children‚Äôs sense of identity and culture is recognised and celebrated in wall displays and celebration of significant events such as Matariki. Members are continuing to develop their confidence in using simple te reo MƒÅori with children.</p><p>Individual children‚Äôs portfolios celebrate their creativity and their involvement in the programme. Some members are effectively identifying their children‚Äôs learning and progress in these portfolios.</p><p>Members provide nurturing and caring relationships with children. They actively involve themselves alongside children in play. ERO observed some of these members effectively promoting children‚Äôs problem solving and oral language skills through their involvement in play. A feature of the centre is the way that members support each other by sharing their parenting skills and knowledge. ERO observed supportive tuakana-teina relationships where older children were very supportive of their younger siblings and peers.</p><p>The centre leaders provide good-quality leadership. They are enthusiastic about ongoing centre development and have successfully overseen the major redevelopment of the centre‚Äôs facilities. Leaders are conscious of the importance of growing leadership skills among parent members to support ongoing sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and members should review the layout of the recently renovated indoor learning environment to:</p><ul>
<li>maximise children‚Äôs access to the centre‚Äôs resources</li>
<li>use wall spaces to display children‚Äôs creativity and learning at children‚Äôs eye level</li>
<li>investigate ways to minimise high noise levels.</li>
</ul><p>The association has agreed that recognising and celebrating the learning for both adults and children is an essential part of valuing the ‚ÄòPlaycentre experience‚Äô. Adding a goal to the association and centre strategic plans for identifying and building on programme successes would focus attention on the quality of learning opportunities and outcomes for children.</p><p>To implement this goal, agreed indicators are needed that identify effective teaching practices that build programme success. These indicators should include interactions that foster children‚Äôs language development, and intentional teaching strategies to engage in, and extend, children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Consideration could also be given to including a responsibility for identifying and modelling quality teaching interactions, and providing feedback, as part of centre support visits. Including references to Ministry of Education guidelines would assist centres to evaluate their programmes and identify areas for further improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mamaku Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mamaku Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
