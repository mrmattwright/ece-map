</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fame Preschool is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 70 children, including up to 15 aged under two years. Infants and toddlers have a separate area where they are free to explore. This area allows them clear visibility into the play space of the older children. Children are encouraged to play together in mixed-age groups and there is easy access for them between the two play spaces.</p><p>The centre owner manages the service alongside a curriculum manager. In 2014 the centre moved to new, larger premises and increased the number of children on the licence. The teaching team now comprises nine qualified teachers and five unqualified staff.</p><p>The service's philosophy strongly values respectful relationships. The performing arts feature highly in the programme and other structured group times are included in daily routines for all children.</p><p>Areas for development from the 2014 ERO report were teacher appraisal, self review and the consistent documentation of children's progress. These aspects of practice require a continued focus for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the mixed-age group. When centre routines allow, siblings are able to play together and there are opportunities for tuakana/teina learning. At these times children confidently choose where they will play and the resources they will use. Friendships are evident amongst the children.</p><p>Teacher interactions with children are mainly positive. Children under two benefit from sensitive, consistent caregiving. They form secure attachments with their caregivers.</p><p>The learning environment is well maintained and attractively presented. As a result of an evaluation, the outdoor area now includes a good range of physical challenges for children, inviting places to engage in imaginative play and opportunities for exploration.</p><p>Centre leaders show good commitment to the ongoing development of teachers' bicultural practice. Some teachers are skilled in their knowledge and use of te reo MƒÅori. Consideration should now be given to how te ao MƒÅori perspectives can be woven throughout the programme.</p><p>Parents participate well in numerous planned centre events. The teaching team is researching ways to strengthen partnerships with parents by including their aspirations for their children's learning in programme planning and evaluation.</p><p>The centre's morning routine revolves around a series of planned group activities. Children move from one specialised programme to another. Some are able to engage in brief periods of independent play between these sessions. Centre routines and the content of these specialised programmes, particularly the transition to school programme for four year olds, require in-depth evaluation.</p><p>The teaching team is in the beginning stages of implementing a new programme planning system. Children's portfolios of learning currently contain numerous group learning stories. Teachers should document more individual learning stories for each child that show how their learning becomes more complex over time.</p><p>Teachers need to align their planned programmes with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and current understandings of high quality practices in an early learning environment. Programmes and routines should more consistently empower children to make decisions about their play and learning, act on their own ideas and develop knowledge and skills in areas that interest them.</p><p>Centre leaders have established a framework of policies and procedures to guide practice. A strategic plan has been developed with input from staff. The ongoing improvement of teaching and learning should be prioritised in the strategic plan. This would support alignment between strategic goals, internal evaluation, teachers' appraisal goals and the programmes that teachers provide for children.</p><p>The process of internal evaluation would be strengthened through the use of a more evaluative process and greater use of research. A stronger focus on goal setting for teachers and the use of the Ministry of Education resource <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> would strengthen appraisal processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager has developed a comprehensive action plan for addressing the following priorities for centre development:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluating routines and group activities to assess their impact on children's learning and engagement, and the extent to which they reflect the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing effective processes for assessment, programme planning and evaluation that build on children's interests and strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by increasing evaluative critique, and making more substantial use of research and indicators of best practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teacher appraisal processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the manager work with the Ministry of Education to reassess the use of the centre's licensed space and to ensure that sufficient activity space is independently accessible by children at all times.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fame Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fame Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
