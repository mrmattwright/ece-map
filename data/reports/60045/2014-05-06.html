</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Otaki Playcentre is one of 20 parent-led early childhood centres administered by the Wellington Playcentre Association (the association). A council oversees operation at governance level and an executive committee provides guidance and support for members. Two centre supporters are employed by the association to visit playcentres and provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. Parents share the duties associated with implementing the programme.</p><p>Playcentre philosophy recognises parents as the best first teachers of their children and emphasises the importance of child-initiated play in mixed-age sessions. Acknowledging Te Tiriti o Waitangi is an integral part of this philosophy.</p><p>Otaki Playcentre is one of many early childhood centres in the area. It serves a diverse community. Members place high value on the centre’s links with the community. They cooperatively make decisions. Positive relationships support centre operations and children’s learning. Three mixed-age sessions are held each week. Since the October 2010 ERO report, this service has been relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. The licensing process was a focus for development for some time. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 20 reviews in the Wellington Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience key playcentre philosophical values. A sense of family and community is evident. There is an ongoing focus on building and maintaining positive relationships. Children are settled and happy learners. The friendly, welcoming culture and support for each other fosters parents’ ongoing commitment to become involved in management roles and training.</p><p>Children are supported to explore, extend their ideas and persevere in play. At times adults should allow children more opportunity to lead their play. This should help to promote children as independent learners.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the programme in meaningful, play-based ways. Children’s language development is fostered through ever-present discussions and conversations. High ratios of adults to children promote opportunities for one-to-one interactions. A calm tone prevails.</p><p>Children have free access to a suitable variety of learning materials. The learning environment is spacious providing many opportunities for children to investigate and use appropriate resources. Provision for construction play is very well developed. The learning environment is extended through trips into the community.</p><p>Centre leaders are committed to continuing the development of bicultural practices in the centre. A review of their approach to implement te reo Māori has been undertaken. This has resulted in a specific, well considered plan supporting children and members. Members and ERO agree that continuing to deepen understanding of the diverse cultures in the community should support an enriched and extended programme.</p><p>There is good provision for infants and toddlers. They are well supported and encouraged to explore play spaces and use a full range of learning materials. A suitable area is specifically designated for those children not yet mobile. Continuing to extend the range of resources for this age group is an agreed goal and priority.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review professional development has been undertaken to enhance members' approach to planning for learning. Leaders are proactive in continuing to improve the process. There is a strong emphasis on identifying children’s learning linked to <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A focus on children and session planning provide opportunity for parents to share their aspirations for developing interests and strengths of their children. Evaluation of sessions should be improved to better plan for individuals. Termly planning information should be more visible for members to make decisions during sessions.</p><p>A core group of members provide strong leadership. They have a good understanding of how to use self review for improving outcomes for children. They should continue to refine their understanding of high quality early childhood practices to support the reviews they undertake. Their knowledge and implementation of review could be shared with other teams across the association.</p><p>The association provides good support and a range of training for members. The centre supporter provides regular and valued face-to-face feedback and aid as needed. Comprehensive and up-to-date written policies and procedures guide office holders in their management roles and members in planning and implementing an appropriate programme.</p><p>The systematic review of and plan to restructure governance and management are being carefully worked through to support a new and more sustainable future for the organisation and the centre. Leaders are keen to delegate administration duties to a paid playcentre employee to allow even more time to focus on children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>deepen their understanding of the diverse cultures in the community</li>
<li>implement more bicultural practices in the learning programme</li>
<li>develop their approach to fostering children’s independence as learners</li>
<li>strengthen their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop centre support processes, based on identified needs and priorities</li>
<li>support members to develop their understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnerships</li>
<li>provide leadership to help members define their understanding of success for Māori as Māori</li>
<li>redevelop the appraisal process to ensure the development needs of centre based employees working with children, are met.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Otaki Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><ul>
<li>The service provider must ensure that whenever children leave the premises on an outing or excursion, assessment and management of risk is undertaken. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Otaki Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>6 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
