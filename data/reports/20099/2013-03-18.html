<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Naturally Kids Early Learning is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre&rsquo;s teaching practices and care for children, its learning environment and well established operational systems, provide a sound foundation.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Naturally Kids Early Learning, formerly Small Wonders Early Childhood Centre, provides care and education for children up to the age of five. The centre is located in a suburban community on the North Shore, in an adapted residential house and has a home-like atmosphere. The owner is in the process of re-establishing the centre under a new name and philosophy, with a mostly new staff team. Four teachers, including the owner and a new team leader, are qualified early childhood teachers. The teaching team is supported by an administration manager.</p><p>The owner and team leaders have a strong commitment to sustaining the centre&rsquo;s current strengths and continuing to enhance provision for children. They have good levels of professional knowledge about early childhood care and education. The owner has made substantial improvements in the learning environments. A new deck has improved access to the outdoors for infants and toddlers, who also have a separate indoor space and are cared for by two qualified teachers.</p><p>New staff have recently been appointed and the roll has increased. The owner is currently focusing on meeting requirements for relicensing under the 2008 early childhood regulations, establishing a collaborative professional teaching team and strengthening partnerships with new families. A professional development programme to support these goals is planned for 2013. Teachers and parents express confidence that the centre is in a good position to continue providing well for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in an unhurried, well resourced environment where relationships and interactions are positive, affirming and respectful. Adults respond well to infants&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; cues and communications and provide good support for language development. Older children have easy access to an inviting, newly redeveloped outdoor area. They initiate imaginative play and collaborate together to extend their ideas. Children are well supported in this learning by responsive adults. Some teachers are particularly skilled at engaging in conversation with children and extending their problem solving and thinking abilities.</p><p>Displays show how the programme has evolved over time in response to children&rsquo;s interests and ideas. These displays celebrate children&rsquo;s abilities and progress and allow them to revisit prior learning experiences. They provide good information for parents about their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>There are good examples of narrative assessment information in children&rsquo;s individual portfolios and infants&rsquo; notebooks. These examples show teachers&rsquo; good knowledge of children and their families. Including the information that parents share about their children would enrich these learning records. Teachers continue to consider ways to refine their assessment, planning and evaluation practices. Planned professional development support should help with this development.</p><p>Systems for scheduled self review are well established. The owner&rsquo;s strategic plan provides a useful basis for developing specific action plans to support ongoing improvements. Working together with staff to develop these plans should help to build a shared understanding of the centre&rsquo;s future direction. Team leaders are further developing their processes for reviewing programmes and reflecting on the quality of teaching practice in order to identify next steps for teaching and learning.</p><p>The owner has had a longstanding commitment to working in partnership with parents to support children&rsquo;s learning, and to providing a forum for parents to contribute to decision making. She should continue working with parents and the teaching team to review and refine the centre&rsquo;s policy and procedures to guide communication, consultation and parent representation in centre decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and team leaders have identified the following positive actions to support ongoing development. They should proceed with planned, externally provided professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify leadership roles in the centre, enhance professional relationships and develop a cohesive teaching team</li>
<li>continue, as planned, to refine the centre&rsquo;s new philosophy statement and develop indicators, that guide teachers in its implementation and provide a framework for programme evaluation</li>
<li>increase the rigour of self review so that all aspects of centre operations are examined in more depth.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Naturally Kids Early Learning completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
