</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Child's Time Penrose is a purpose-built centre. It is licensed for 82 children, including up to 30 children aged under two years, in all-day or sessional programmes. The centre opened in January 2015 and this is their first ERO review.</p><p>The indoor environment is divided into three age-related rooms. A spacious shared outdoor area for children over two years allows for mixed-age play opportunities. Infants and toddlers have their own inviting outdoor space.</p><p>Children and their families reflect the diverse cultures of the local community. Māori children make up 17 percent of the roll and 18 percent are Pacific. Other groups include South East Asian, Chinese and Indian children. About two-thirds of children have English as an additional language.</p><p>The centre's vision and philosophy guide practices and developments at the centre. Fostering respectful, trusting partnerships with children and families is an important focus of the service's philosophy.</p><p>The owner is one of two centre managers. They lead the centre with the head teachers. An external professional learning provider mentors the team of qualified teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and confident, and interact well with their peers and teachers. They are encouraged to take increasing responsibility for their own wellbeing and to care for others. Their social and emotional competence is promoted well.</p><p>The education and care for infants and toddlers is high quality. Responsive caregiving supports their needs for strong and secure attachments with adults. Teachers maintain a calm pace and provide space and time for younger children to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children over two years of age participate in a semi-structured programme that allows them to freely explore the environment. They make choices about their own play. The learning environment gives children easy access to appropriate resources. Teachers take time to genuinely listen to children and foster their language development. Some good teaching practices support and extend children’s play.</p><p>The programme, planning and assessment processes are closely aligned with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers' planning and assessment for infants and toddlers is individualised and responsive to their learning abilities. Teachers of older children are reviewing and trialling approaches that focus on individual and group interests.</p><p>Centre leaders are committed to enhancing the service's bicultural curriculum. Te reo me ōna tikanga Māori are a feature in the infants' and toddlers' room. Cultural events such as Matariki are celebrated with children and families. Leaders also acknowledge they could consider how to reflect the children's home languages and cultures in their learning records.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed and strengthened transition processes. Successful transitions for children are supported by effective partnerships between families and schools. Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions into and within the service. The service has a good relationship with the neighbouring school.</p><p>The service is very welcoming to children and families. Teachers offer many opportunities for parents to keep informed. They gather families' aspirations to contribute to programme planning. Online learning records allow families' ready access to information about their children’s learning. Teachers have started to provide workshops for parents about how children learn through play.</p><p>The centre is well led and a useful leadership and professional learning structure is in place. This provides mentoring, leadership and appraisal support that helps teachers to reflect on and improve their teaching practice.</p><p>Managers have well established processes for internal evaluation. The purpose of internal evaluation is well understood. Teachers regularly engage in self review with a focus on improving outcomes for children. Managers are about to review the service's strategic plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing teaching strategies that support older children’s individual interests, extend their thinking and promote more complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing centre-wide leadership responsibilities to help progress the service's priorities and goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using evaluative questions and indicators of effective practice to strengthen internal evaluation. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Child's Time Penrose completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Child's Time Penrose will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>14 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
