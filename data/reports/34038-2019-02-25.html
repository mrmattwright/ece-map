</table><p>Te Rapa Early Education Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Rapa Early Education Centre is located in the north west of Hamilton City. It provides full-day education and care for up to 61 children from three months to school age, in three separate age-based settings. The roll of 54 includes children from a range of ethnicities, including Māori.</p><p>Through the philosophy relationships that develop a sense of belonging are promoted. This aims to encourage tamariki to participate, make choices, develop independence and manage their developing social competencies. The philosophy of aroha and respectful partnerships are underpinned by Treaty of Waitangi principles.</p><p>The last ERO report in 2015 identified the need to review systems and practices to strengthen curriculum design and implementation, and contribute to continuity of learning for children up to three years. Centre leaders and teachers have effectively addressed this need.</p><p>There have been a number of staff changes since the last ERO review, including the appointment of an acting manager in March 2018. This position has been extended until June 2019. The centre operates under the umbrella of Waikato Kindergarten Association. It is one of seven education and care centres which are part of the Early Education Waikato Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm and respectful practices and relationships that guide curriculum design and implementation. Reciprocal relationships are formed with each child and their family. The key teacher strategy for babies is pivotal to building trusting relationships and secure attachments for these children. Leaders and teachers work in close partnership with parents and external agencies to support participation and learning for children with additional needs. Key strengths for the Te Rapa Early Education curriculum are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fostering children’s social competence, where all teachers demonstrate skill in developing children's empathy, awareness of themselves and others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well-considered responsive and individualised transitions that foster children's wellbeing and confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Resources for Infant Educators (RIE) approach, where there is trust in babies and toddlers to be initiators, explorers and self learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for children of all ages to learn about and care for the natural environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Assessment planning and evaluation has been re-developed over the past year. There is a centre-wide approach to planning for individual children. This method is increasingly guiding intentional teaching strategies designed to extend children’s interests and learning. The centre is now well placed to extend teachers knowledge to further enhance the quality and consistency of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Children confidently engage in self-led play. Teachers allow them uninterrupted time and space to follow interests, make choices and exercise their preferences about relationships, activities and routines. They engage in meaningful conversations, encouraging children's talk, making connections to family members and interests. Teachers genuinely listen to children and effectively foster their oral language development.</p><p>Teachers' use of reo and tikanga Māori is developing. Some teachers confidently use te reo Māori in meaningful contexts with children. Current centre internal review acknowledges the need for leaders to continue to challenge and grow teacher's capability to inquire into the effectiveness of the bicultural curriculum and treaty based practices. This development should further validate te ao Māori for Māori children and others.</p><p>Leadership is effective in achieving positive changes to teaching practice and curriculum implementation. A well-considered approach to change management has contributed to teachers capability to consistently promote positive outcomes for all children. There is clear alignment between strategic and annual plans, internal evaluation, professional learning and staff appraisal and inquiry. The professional learning culture among staff is based on relational trust, reflective practice, an openness to new learning and has resulted in improved systems, practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>A clear vision, philosophy and effective centre operations promote positive learning outcomes for children. Sound policies, procedures and guidelines underpin day-to-day operations. The recently reviewed strategic direction provides a clear vision for each child to reach their potential. Governance demonstrates a strong commitment to providing quality education and care. This is evident in consistent resourcing that supports quality ratios for babies and toddlers, and the recent and significant upgrades to buildings and grounds.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders acknowledge the need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and refine curriculum design and implementation in response to the refreshed <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. In developing the local curriculum it will be important for leaders, teachers, parents and whānau to build a shared understanding of what constitutes their local curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen practices, resources and opportunities to extend and empower older children to take greater leadership of their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Rapa Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Rapa Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>25 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
