</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lower Hutt City Childcare Centre is a long-established, community-based early childhood service. It operates as a not-for-profit centre bound by a charitable trust deed.</p><p>A management committee made up of parents and the supervisor undertakes a governance role. The supervisor is responsible for day-to-day operation. The centre has a full-day licence and caters for children from infancy up to primary school age. The roll is full with a waiting list in place.</p><p>The philosophy guiding teaching and learning identifies inclusive practice, fostering children’s curiosity, respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi and strong relationships, as key to effective teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre serves a diverse cultural community. There is a continuing focus on promoting collaborative relationships with parents and gaining their participation in decision-making. The development of the learning environment is also ongoing.</p><p>After ERO's May 2011 supplementary review, a new centre supervisor was permanently appointed. All the present parent committee members have taken up their trustee roles since that time. All teachers, except one, are new. Five of the nine teaching staff are registered teachers. Remaining staff are in the final stages of completing their qualifications.</p><p>The Ministry of Education placed the centre on a transitional licence after the 2011 ERO review. The service was successful in gaining full licence status in mid 2013, after professional development to support improved planning for learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Practice generally reflects teachers’ commitment to the values stated in the philosophy. The centre has a welcoming and inclusive tone. Building positive and reciprocal relationships between teachers and families to support children’s wellbeing and learning is a strong focus.</p><p>Children’s cultures, identities and special learning needs are acknowledged and respected. Teachers express commitment to continued improvement in their understanding of te ao Māori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnership.</p><p>The environment is suitably resourced to support teaching and learning. Children of all ages are able to freely access materials that promote a wide variety of play experiences for extended periods. At these times a positive and busy tone is maintained, indicative of children's wellbeing and sustained engagement in learning. Staff should review the organisation of some aspects of the play spaces to maximise opportunities for children to investigate and research new learning and play possibilities.</p><p>Teachers are responsive and respectful. Relationships with children are close, and comfortable. For the majority of the day teachers engage well with children acknowledging their competence and appropriately supporting them in their self-chosen play and learning.</p><p>Good strategies are used to extend ideas and interests and promote self management. Children are independent, cooperative and competent learners. Teachers now need to think about how they can extend this good practice into the mid-day transitions and routines.</p><p>Provision for children aged up to two years is based on sound and up-to-date practice. Two experienced teachers are designated specifically to work with these children. Infants and toddlers are content and active participants in the mixed-age programme. Increasing the range of resources and continuing specialised professional development are priorities that will be actioned to sustain good practice.</p><p>Further development of the present approach to supporting transition to primary school is timely. This should include strengthening liaison with local schools and exploring links between early childhood and school programmes. High ratios of staff to children promote opportunities for one-to-one interaction.</p><p>Staff regularly share information about individual children’s strengths, interests, learning dispositions and the aspirations parents have for their children. Individual profile books record emerging interests, participation in centre activities and aspects of learning progress.</p><p>Teachers continue to work on increasing parents’ and whānau input into the assessment process. A suitable development step should be to evaluate the approach in relation to the best practice principles presented in the recent professional development.</p><p>The relatively new team work well together in the interests of children. They are well supported in their roles. A redeveloped appraisal process, when implemented, should better identify development needs and promote improvement to the quality of teaching.</p><p>A more rigorous process to support the supervisor’s practice needs to be introduced. Improving the organisation of guiding documents, reporting and records should strengthen operational systems and access to essential information.</p><p>Self review is valued as a tool to promote better outcomes for children. The next development step is to implement the new self-review process so sustained improvement to practice and operation can be facilitated.</p><p>The parent committee provides a high level of support for leadership and the teaching team. Over time there has been a successful drive to positively change the culture and tone of the organisation to ensure sustainability. This is resulting in continuously improved practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>Priorities for the parent committee include:</p><ul>
<li>redeveloping the strategic plan to identify priorities and provide a basis for review and long-term development</li>
<li>developing written guidelines and expectations to support committee members in their roles</li>
<li>strengthening some financial management procedures and the collation of minutes and reporting.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to support improvement to teaching and learning, the supervisor and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>define, in collaboration with whānau , thinking around what constitutes success for Maori children, as Māori,</li>
<li>develop understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnership</li>
<li>review and develop programme planning</li>
<li>develop understanding and use of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The supervisor and parent committee should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>the new appraisal process is suitably implemented</li>
<li>operational documentation and procedures, including minutes and reporting, are suitably organised.</li>
</ul><p>To support the sustainability and review and development of the governance role, the management committee needs to:</p><ul>
<li>redevelop the strategic plan</li>
<li>formally define governance and management roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>improve financial management procedures.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lower Hutt City Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure teachers and the supervisor are supported by a suitable appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lower Hutt City Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>11 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
