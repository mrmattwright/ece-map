</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Magic Garden Over 3.5‚Äôs Care &amp; Education Centre on Auckland‚Äôs North Shore, provides high quality care and education for up to 40 children over three and a half years old to school age. The well established service has been overseen by the same service provider and long serving teachers for many years. It operates as one of three centres in a purpose-built facility. The centre occupies well maintained premises with very good facilities for staff. Nutritious meals are prepared on site by the centre‚Äôs cook. The service provider regards the three licences as a single entity in many aspects, resulting in administrative and operational systems that are common across the centres.</p><p>Successive ERO reports have commented on the positive and affirming relationships among teachers, children and families. They have noted how the child-centred programme nurtures children‚Äôs well being, sense of belonging and provokes children‚Äôs thinking through trusting relationships with peers and teachers. These positive factors continue to be significant features of the centre.</p><p>The centre has responded very well to the 2012 ERO report. Teachers have continued to develop their understanding of bicultural practice. The centre is forging a unique identity through a newly established kapa haka group and centre waiata developed with MƒÅori whƒÅnau support.</p><p>The centre philosophy embraces <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and integrates aspects of Reggio Emilia in the programme. A recently designed ‚ÄòPriorities for Learning‚Äô document guides teaching and learning. Managers and teachers are in the process of reviewing the philosophy to further embrace other theoretical approaches.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Individual children and their families are highly respected. Teachers value parents‚Äô aspirations for their children and include these in programme planning. Children experience caring and secure relationships within a calm and unhurried learning environment.</p><p>Children have conversations with each other and with teachers that include highly developed ideas and thinking. They share their knowledge and understanding with others and are proud of their successes. Children benefit from uninterrupted play. They explore, use their imagination, investigate and make independent choices from the wide range of available resources.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They are skilled at listening to and supporting children to extend their understandings. Teachers successfully integrate literacy, numeracy and science into the programme. They plan attractive and inviting learning environments where children‚Äôs ideas are incorporated into the programme. Children are confident and curious learners. They display a love of learning and are allowed to ‚Äòbe children‚Äô.</p><p>Teachers and children are building their skills and knowledge about MƒÅori culture and language. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are integrated into the programme. Teachers acknowledge the unique place of MƒÅori and are finding additional ways to include this in the programme.</p><p>Innovative processes for programme planning and assessment are evident. Various planning documents provide very useful records of children‚Äôs learning and development over time. Parent contributions are supported by high quality teacher reflections. Teachers can now extend their use of child‚Äôs voice in this process and also consider ways to reflect the diversity of their community in programme documents. Teachers have developed initiatives for children's smooth transitions to school. They are strengthening relationships with local schools to further promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô professional capabilities are fostered through appraisal, distributed leadership and ongoing professional development. Teachers are reflective, work collaboratively and benefit from the owner/manager‚Äôs effective professional leadership. They are dedicated and improvement focused.</p><p>The owner/manager has very effective management practices, policies and procedures to inform centre operations. Self review is robust and guides decision making. Parent and community partnerships are integral to the centre. Parents have the opportunity to contribute to self review across the centre. A centre focus on community involvement and valuing families underpins centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and ERO agreed that teachers could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>embed practices for reflection and evaluation of their teaching on outcomes for children</li>
<li>enhance bicultural knowledge and practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Magic Garden Over 3.5's Care &amp; Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><p>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Magic Garden Over 3.5's Care &amp; Education Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review¬†process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
