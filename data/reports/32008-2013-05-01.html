<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The playcentre is well placed to promote positive education outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Tairua Playcentre is located in the coastal town of Tairua, on the Coromandel Peninsula. It provides two morning sessions a week for children from birth to school age. The current roll is 18, of whom 14 are boys and six identify as M&#257;ori. The spacious and attractive site adjoins the local primary school grounds.</p><p>The centre operates as a parent cooperative under the umbrella of the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association (TVCPA), which provides philosophy guidelines, policy frameworks and adult education courses. Families are committed to this playcentre philosophy, whereby parents are seen as the first educators of their children, and children learn through play. After a six month gap in 2012, members are now receiving valuable, ongoing, administrative and educational support from an experienced and knowledgeable TVCPA liaison officer. The challenge for the president, appointed in 2011, and more experienced centre members, is to continue to raise overall levels of parent education in playcentre training, to consistently meet qualification points requirements for funded sessions.</p><p>Previous ERO reports identified areas for development in assessment, planning and evaluation, and in the support and guidance being provided by TVCPA. Centre leadership responded constructively and progress is evident in both areas, but further consolidation and development of these are still needed.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience affirming and respectful relationships with interested and familiar adults. Social skills are effectively promoted in a family-like atmosphere where older children regularly include and show consideration for younger children. Infants and toddlers are well supported and able to explore safely. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and identity.</p><p>Adults engage children in extended conversations which frequently include questioning to extend their thinking and learning. Oral language and communication is particularly strong and consistently modelled by adults. Opportunities for children to take part in creative and imaginative play are highly evident. They are able to initiate and lead their own play, particularly in the inside areas where children have ready access to an age-appropriate range of resources. The opportunities for older children to develop early mathematical skills, and their knowledge of the natural world are more variable and in these areas centre leaders recognise where further programme development is needed. Children benefit from positive links with the local primary school and are well supported as they transition to school.</p><p>Features of the playcentre are the close relationships and the sharing of knowledge between parents, their families and the local community. Effective communication among the community of parents is extended and strengthened through on-line contacts, texting and kete bags. A high proportion of parents accept their share of the responsibility for centre operations, and participate in regular session evaluations and planning meetings. There is evidence of improving self review covering emergent and longer term matters. Parents have made considerable efforts to review and develop children&rsquo;s individual assessment portfolios, which provide an informative record of their involvement in the programme. The next step about this assessment practice is to give greater emphasis to recording children&rsquo;s own voice and to promote these useful documents.</p><p>Adult leadership in the centre is shared and highly co-operative. The president, education officer, treasurer and secretary in particular, have established clear expectations for parent involvement and contributions to operations. All parents are effectively encouraged and supported to undertake playcentre adult education courses. The education officer and TVCPA liaison officer have ensured parents can work in supportive groups and have access to online mentoring to complete courses.</p><p>Recent restructuring of TVCPA has encouraged playcentre parents to have a more active and direct input into the strategic direction of the association. The playcentre has also started the development of an action plan to guide centre development, planning and evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members have introduced documented self review, which mainly covers operational matters. The next steps for centre members are to make reference to current models of good practice in early childhood education to further strengthen their review of:</p><ul>
<li>programme planning to ensure it is more child-initiated, and more effectively engages and extends older children, especially boys</li>
<li>the integration of M&#257;ori language and other curriculum areas such as literacy, mathematics and science throughout the programme</li>
<li>the learning environment in order to increase children&rsquo;s independent access to equipment, especially in the outdoors, and promote sustained challenging and explorative play.</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommends that the TVCPA liaison officer continues to work with centre members as they develop and implement action plans to bring about the key next steps identified in this report.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tairua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>1 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
