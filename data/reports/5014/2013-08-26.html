</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onerahi Free Kindergarten is one of 21 kindergartens that operate under the governance of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is in an outlying suburb of Whangarei, and serves a multicultural community. WhƒÅnau sometimes travel lengthy distances to attend the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten has recently changed the hours children may attend by providing school day sessions for three days a week. Families are able to select the days they wish children to attend. Some children continue to attend morning sessions only.</p><p>The association provides a framework of policies and procedures that are reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Teachers‚Äô practices are monitored and supported by a number of association personnel including a MƒÅori Pou Whakarewa Tikanga who has supported teachers to strengthen their bicultural practises. An association speech language therapist also supports children and teachers. Regular visits and reports from the professional practice manager affirm teachers‚Äô work and identify improvements they should consider.</p><p>Teachers are able to access regular professional development provided by the association. This support fosters the association‚Äôs expectations of high quality practices from teachers. Day-to-day management of the kindergarten is delegated to the head teacher and the teaching team.</p><p>Onerahi Free Kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children thrive in a programme that supports them to make choices and include their friends. They are eager to attend and settle quickly at the start of the day. Warm welcomes for families and children set the scene for the lively and positive tone to the day. Teachers work collaboratively to provide high quality programmes.</p><p>Children take meaningful leadership roles by planning their own play and learning. Teachers provide resources and suggestions to encourage children to think about their play and extend their learning. Children are collaborative and friendly. They talk cheerfully together and often use tuakana/teina strategies to include others in imaginative games. Inclusion practices are well established and modelled by both children and teachers.</p><p>Programmes that support te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are well established. Teachers initially worked with the association Pou Whakarewa Tikanga and now take responsibility for increasing their own focus on bicultural education. One teacher in particular, supports the team to strengthen their own and children‚Äôs understanding of New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. Learning about MƒÅori legends, particularly about the local area, forms an important part of the programme. The association‚Äôs Pumanawatanga bicultural programme provides a clear framework for teachers.</p><p>Teachers initiate conversations that encourage and support children‚Äôs ideas and thinking. Opportunities to learn about the value of reading, writing, numeracy and scientific exploration are linked to enjoyable play experiences. Children are also becoming proficient with using information and communication technologies (ICT) as part of the programme. Children transition easily to school.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolios provide informative glimpses into their activities and experiences. Photographs and children‚Äôs own words provide authentic explanations about what they learn through their play. Teachers‚Äô knowledge about children‚Äôs strengths and interests adds to the development of supportive and interesting planning.</p><p>Teachers use detailed self review to reflect on their work with children and to make decisions about their teaching. Team leadership plays an important part in the effectiveness of programmes, and teachers are enthusiastic about their work. WhƒÅnau have opportunities to contribute to decisionmaking about developments or changes to practices. Children are included when review impacts on their play and the resources provided for them. Teachers make responding to partnership opportunities easy for families by explaining their thinking clearly and encouraging participation. Families appreciate the opportunity to contribute.</p><p>Management systems and processes are closely linked to association expectations and frameworks. Teachers appreciate the useful support and guidance provided by association personnel which helps them to sustain high quality practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, association representatives and teachers identified next steps for the kindergarten to be:</p><ul>
<li>considering ways of extending children‚Äôs play further to broaden their learning experiences</li>
<li>revisiting ways to promote programmes around healthy eating for children and parents</li>
<li>continue building upon inclusion of cultural diversity in programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onerahi Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onerahi Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>26 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
