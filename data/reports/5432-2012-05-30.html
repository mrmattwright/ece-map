<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood is located in Christchurch. The kindergarten has recently changed its operating hours. The kindergarten currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm for up to 30 children. It is licensed to take up to 40 children over two years of age. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>affirming relationships between teachers, children and families that promote a strong sense of belonging</li>
<li>the way teachers foster children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, and encourage the development of children&rsquo;s language</li>
<li>the effective interactions that teachers use to support and extend children&rsquo;s thinking</li>
<li>well organised and resourced indoor and outdoor play areas.</li>
</ul><p>The experienced teaching team work well together to support children&rsquo;s learning during the programme.</p><p>The next steps for the teachers to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>review the impact of the change to operating hours on the learning programme and teaching practices</li>
<li>further develop guidelines for programme planning and assessment expectations</li>
<li>strengthen self review of their practices, the programme and operations.</li>
</ul><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were still responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, and personnel. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the association and kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team, the education service manager and teachers. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Teachers aim to provide a welcoming environment that supports children&rsquo;s play and promotes their physical and emotional development and an inclusive culture that celebrates the diverse backgrounds of children and wh&#257;nau. Strong emphasis is placed on the involvement of family and community in the kindergarten programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Positive relationships are a feature of the kindergarten. Teachers focus on promoting a strong sense of belonging for children and their families. Teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau interact in supportive ways. Teachers show an understanding of children&rsquo;s home lives and circumstances and use this information to have meaningful conversations with them.</p><p>Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>use a range of strategies to support children to develop their social skills with each other and adults.</li>
<li>encourage children to develop their speaking skills and use language, including te reo M&#257;ori, for a variety of purposes</li>
<li>support and encourage children to take part in new and varied experiences, including trips into the local community.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers interact with children in affirming ways, play effectively alongside children, and use questions that help children talk about their play and learning in greater depth. Children&rsquo;s successes are noticed and praised. Teachers communicate well with each other and share information that helps them respond to children in more meaningful ways.</p><p>Children play in an environment that has interesting and attractive play areas and opportunities to explore. The outdoor area includes good use of natural plantings and materials and provides a wide range of activities. A good range of equipment and resources enable children to be challenged. The indoor areas are well organised and resourced to encourage and support children to follow their interests.</p><p>Teachers have useful systems for sharing information with children and their families about learning and participation in the programme. They regularly collate information and record it in children&rsquo;s profiles. These profiles are readily accessible to children and their families. Teachers make good use of visual displays to share learning experiences with children and families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The kindergarten has recently undergone a change of hours and sessions. As a result it is timely to review:</p><ul>
<li>ways teachers regularly meet and review change</li>
<li>the purpose of children&rsquo;s group times and the opportunities children have for leadership and decision making during these times</li>
<li>the structure of the daily programme to ensure that children have good opportunities for sustained play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should now strengthen group planning practices. They have identified that they are in the early stages of developing manageable systems for documenting group planning.</p><p>While ERO identified a number of examples of good practice in children&rsquo;s assessment, these practices were not consistently evident across all profile books. Teachers should now develop clear expectations and guidelines to utilise individual teacher strengths in assessment to ensure consistency across profile books. This could include identification of what learning has occurred and possible next steps for learning.</p><p>Teachers identify relevant areas for self review and gather appropriate amounts of information. The next steps to further strengthen self review are:</p><ul>
<li>identifying trends, patterns and issues and reflecting on the reasons for these</li>
<li>the development of specific plans for change based on these findings</li>
<li>the evaluation of planned changes.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the teachers of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood completed an ERO and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-linwood" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Linwood is located in Christchurch. The kindergarten has recently changed its operating hours. The kindergarten currently operates Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm for up to 30 children. It is licensed to take up to 40 children over two years of age. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>affirming relationships between teachers, children and families that promote a strong sense of belonging</li>
<li>the way teachers foster children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, and encourage the development of children&rsquo;s language</li>
<li>the effective interactions that teachers use to support and extend children&rsquo;s thinking</li>
<li>well organised and resourced indoor and outdoor play areas.</li>
</ul><p>The experienced teaching team work well together to support children&rsquo;s learning during the programme.</p><p>The next steps for the teachers to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>review the impact of the change to operating hours on the learning programme and teaching practices</li>
<li>further develop guidelines for programme planning and assessment expectations</li>
<li>strengthen self review of their practices, the programme and operations.</li>
</ul><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were still responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, and personnel. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
