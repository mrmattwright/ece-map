</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mountain View Preschool Limited is located in Rotorua. It is an education and care service owned by Provincial Childcare who also own and operate 16 other centres throughout the North Island. The centre offers full day and sessional services. They provide meals for children, and owners have a strong commitment to equity in education. The centre is licensed for 42 children including 15 aged under two years. The current roll of 49 children, includes 29 of M&#257;ori descent. Mountain View Preschool Limited operates two learning spaces, one for children under two years of age and another for those over two.</p><p>The centre philosophy encapsulates the beliefs, values and attitudes of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>partnership/ whanaungatanga</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>holistic development/ kotahitanga</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>open communication/ ng&#257; Hononga</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional development/ako.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre has responded well to the recommendations of the 2014 ERO report. Staffing has been stabilised over the last two years and the majority of teachers are fully qualified.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a curriculum that reflects and responds to their cultural identity and community values. Bicultural practice is strongly evident. A commitment to the M&#257;ori values of manakitanga, aroha and whanaungatanga has promoted an inclusive welcoming centre culture. The centre participates in celebration of festivals such as Waitangi Day and Matariki. This strengthens children's sense of whanaungatanga, and enhances their understanding of kaupapa and tikanga M&#257;ori in an inclusive and authentic way. Importance is given to the teaching of local history and p&#363;rakau through waiata and visits to local places of significance. This enhances children's sense of t&#363;rangawaewae and identity as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Parents and wh&#257;nau are made to feel welcome and there are many opportunities for them to contribute and be involved. Assessment practices have been modified, teachers have deliberate ongoing discussions with wh&#257;nau to accurately identify next steps for children to enable them to extend their interests and share these with wh&#257;nau, in line with teacher beliefs about the importance of acknowledging the strengths, interests and whakapapa children bring to their learning.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into all areas of play. There are many opportunities for children to explore, be challenged and engage in sustained play. Well-embedded systems and routines encourage a calm and settled environment where children are engaged in leading their learning through play. Transitions within the centre are well managed. The service has good relationships with many of the local schools and facilitates smooth transitions for children.</p><p>Priority is given to ensuring that teachers and centre environment respond to the needs of children with additional learning needs and their wh&#257;nau. Poutama, a transition to school programme, provides extra opportunities for children to develop literacy and mathematics skills prior to moving onto school. The centre curriculum promotes a strong sense of belonging and a positive, confident sense of self and community.</p><p>Teachers know children and their wh&#257;nau well. They work collaboratively in their best interests. Warm respectful and reciprocal relationships are evident between teachers and children. Teachers in the over-two learning area respond well to child-initiated play activities to extend thinking and support oral language development. They support problem solving, exploration and provide feedback to children that acknowledges effort and success. Teachers intentionally provide well-planned activities for children to enhance their leadership skills reflecting the service's philosophy about rangatiratanga.</p><p>Teachers in the under-two learning area, foster a caring environment. Teachers communicate closely with parents in response to individual children's care needs. Children have easy access to a well-resourced and inviting centre environment that encourages exploration. Children benefit from a meaningful and well-structured teaching and learning programme.</p><p>Centre leaders are experienced and effective in the day-to-day and strategic management of the centre. Leaders know the community well and value and respect their aspirations for tamariki. Leaders are highly committed to an inclusive and bicultural curriculum. There is a strong focus on equitable outcomes for all children and wh&#257;nau. There is an effective process in place for self review that leads to improved outcomes for children. Leaders provide effective support for the teaching team and opportunities for teachers to grow professional capability.</p><p>A well-qualified and experienced Provincial Childcare Holdings management team is providing highly effective governance and professional leadership for the centre. There is regular and ongoing mentoring and support for teachers and the community from suitably qualified and experienced professional staff. There are well-documented policy and procedural guidelines. Clear and appropriate strategic and annual plans provide direction for the centre. Children benefit from a robust and effective performance management system for teachers that includes a comprehensive induction and mentoring process to respond well to children's needs. Effective governance is contributing to a strategic and positive sense of purpose and direction for the centre. Provincial Childcare Holdings are highly committed to the community to maintain an authentic learning environment and provide quality education for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the following next steps are important for the ongoing development of the service are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the focus on individualised planning reflecting the child's progression over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the documentation of parent and whanau contribution to individual assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring systems for leadership to further enhance teaching practices and embed expectations particularly with regard to bicultural practice and assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mountain View Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mountain View Preschool Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>7 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in&nbsp;SECTION 3&nbsp;of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service&nbsp;</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
