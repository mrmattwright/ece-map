</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (205) is <em>well placed</em> to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (205) is located in Linwood. It is one of 11 early childhood education and care centres, in Christchurch, owned and administered by the Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The service owners have a strong philosophy, useful policies and procedures and a framework for monitoring health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support the effective operation of the centre.</p><p>The areas for review and development identified in the April 2011 ERO report, including self review and bicultural practices, have been successfully addressed. The centre director has identified that aspects of long and short-term planning and evaluation could be further improved to build on the good practices evident during this review. The service philosophy of providing children with security, love and learning, is well reflected in centre practices and documentation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Kindercare Learning Centres Service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy is very effective in supporting positive relationships with children and families as the basis for successful play and learning. This is reinforced in the respectful and supportive way that teachers work with children, families and one another. Teachers are very affirming of children‚Äôs efforts and encourage a positive sense of self worth, confidence and belonging.</p><p>The centre director and teachers place a strong focus on developing children‚Äôs emotional and social learning to support children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and readiness for learning. They help children to develop the skills they need to initiate and maintain relationships, and to play cooperatively. Children enjoy developing friendships. They play well with and alongside others for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Teachers identify and nurture the interests, strengths and capabilities of young children very well. Teachers take time to talk with children and help them to be involved in sustained interactions and conversations. ERO observed some good examples of teachers extending children‚Äôs oral language, thinking and creativity. Children are supported to express their ideas through imaginative role play and music and movement. Parents and whƒÅnau are well informed about their children‚Äôs participation and learning through attractively presented wall displays and individual portfolios.</p><p>The centre director and teachers are well placed to meet the diverse needs and capabilities of students with special education needs and effectively include them in the programme.</p><p>The learning environments are well planned and include learning experiences that are related to children‚Äôs current interests. Children are actively involved in a wide range of activities within the inside and outside areas. Teachers make good use of both areas to support and extend children‚Äôs learning interests.</p><p>Transition into the centre and between each area within the centre is well managed. The centre is working with local schools to develop stronger links to support successful transitions.</p><p>The centre director provides well-informed professional leadership. She sets high and clear expectations for teaching and learning to ensure that children have a secure base from which they can explore and learn.</p><p>The centre director and teachers have effectively established a self-review process to make important changes that benefit children. Teachers are well supported to develop their reflective practices to help them to contribute more successfully to centre-wide review and strengthen teaching practices.</p><p>A recent review to strengthen bicultural perspectives has resulted in an increasing use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the MƒÅori culture.</p><p>Priorities for professional development are informed by self review, teacher reflections and appraisal. The ongoing professional learning of teachers is effectively supported by an area programme and at team level.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre director, area manager and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop long-term and annual planning for the centre so that it can prioritise how it will meet the Kindercare vision and goals</li>
<li>provide a planned approach to self review that aligns to centre priorities and the service‚Äôs goals</li>
<li>extend planning and evaluation to show how teachers work with children</li>
<li>continue to build parent and child contributions to planning and celebrating children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (205) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (205) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>26 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
