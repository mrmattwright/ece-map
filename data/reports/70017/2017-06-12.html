</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre: Linwood (205) is privately owned. It is one of 12 early learning centres in Christchurch owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The centre operates under the Kindercare philosophy, values, management and accountability systems. An area manager works in partnership with centre leaders to guide the effective operation of each centre.</p><p>This centre provides education and care for children from two years to school age in three separate rooms. The rooms are specifically organised to meet age group needs.</p><p>Families from a diverse range of cultures attend the centre. Parents have the opportunity to participate in a Kindercare parent education programme. Centre leaders are part of the Linwood Community Learning Cluster group.</p><p>Most staff are fully qualified, certified teachers. Several staff have worked at the centre for long periods of time. The centre cook provides nutritious vegetarian meals and snacks.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the centre has refurbished inside and upgraded the outdoor play areas. There have been changes in leadership of the centre and a new area manager appointed. Leaders and teachers are continuing to make good progress with the recommendations from the 2014 ERO report. Centre leaders follow the Kindercare process for annual planning and self review. Kindercare has introduced a curriculum support position in the centre to assist with the new assessment, planning and evaluation processes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of reviews of 12 Kindercare Learning Centres in the Christchurch area in Term 1, 2017. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service values of ‘safe, loved, and learning’ are well integrated into centre practices and documentation. Children and families experience welcoming, inclusive relationships with teachers. Leaders and teachers are responsive to children’s needs and build supportive relationships with parents.</p><p>Children are busy and focus on their chosen activities. They have many opportunities to explore their individual interests in the well-resourced and attractively presented indoor and outside environments. Children make good use of a wide assortment of resources to promote imaginative and creative play.</p><p>Teachers involve children in calm, respectful interactions. They extend children's ideas and oral language skills by asking meaningful questions during conversations. Teachers purposefully include literacy and mathematics in the learning programme.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are flexible and meet the needs of children and families. Teachers support children's transition to school by helping them develop independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children's learning interests through a range of methods, such as written records, photos and technologies that provide ongoing opportunities for parent feedback.</p><p>Leaders have strong community networks and links with external agencies and local schools. They provide clear expectations for teachers. Leaders make positive use of teachers' strengths in leadership roles and provide targeted professional development and regular mentoring.</p><p>Leaders and teachers make good use of self review to continually improve teacher practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Kindercare has many systems to help services promote good quality teaching and improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support for centre directors for the day-to-day operation of the centres through regular visits by area managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the provision of well-targeted professional development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase bicultural perspectives, practices and use of te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop strategic and annual action planning, and evaluation of agreed goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen evaluative self-review processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine and embed assessment, planning and evaluation practices. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that the key next steps for Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give greater prominence to bicultural perspectives in key documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to strengthen partnerships in learning with schools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalise and document the procedure for appraisal and attestation in the Christchurch area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate how well current learning-record practices allow children to revisit their own learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres - Linwood (205) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres - Linwood (205) will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>12 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
