</table><p>Divine Foundation Home Base is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Divine Foundation Home Base is licensed to provide home based education and care for up to 50 children, including 22 children aged under two years. There are currently 43 children enrolled in this network, and most children are Tongan with small numbers of other Pacific, MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ ethnicities. The licensee and staff communicate with and provide information for families in Tongan, Samoan and English languages. This is the first ERO evaluation of the service.</p><p>The service has been operating since October 2017, and is led by the owner/licensee. A manager oversees the operation of the service. A qualified and registered coordinator works alongside seven educators. The coordinator is supported by a qualified and registered relieving coordinator. Together with the manager they provide support and guidance for the educators working in their homes. They hold regular monthly meetings, targeted workshops and planned special events to support educators.</p><p>The owner, manager and coordinator have established a well-defined vision 'Children are our treasures - Ko e fƒÅnau ko e mata'ikoloa'. This vision sits at the heart of all service systems and processes. The philosophy of the service encompasses valuing the child, parents, families and communities, and believing that every child has the potential for greatness. The philosophy shows commitment to providing every child an opportunity to have fun, play and learn within a high quality home environment is a focus. The service agrees that the philosophy needs further refinement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Educators have a good knowledge of children and their whƒÅnau. This is reflected in children's records of learning where their home languages and cultures are honoured. Educators are beginning to document the learning that is taking place during the day for each child. The coordinator has begun to introduce the educators to the importance of different types of play. She recognises the need to work closely with educators to develop their understanding around the fundamentals of early childhood education.</p><p>The manager and coordinator provide opportunities for educators, children and whƒÅnau to come together to take part in special social and cultural events. They see this as one way of developing meaningful relationships and providing collaborative experiences for all involved. The manager and coordinator should now develop further channels of communication between the service and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The service is committed to promoting bicultural awareness and practices across all systems. Matariki celebrations and MƒÅori Language Week enhance children's understanding of te ao MƒÅori. Educators attend workshops on making MƒÅori resources, and how to develop an understanding of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>There are well-managed transitions into educators' homes. The service supports parents to transition their children to school. The service acknowledges the need to strengthen educators' understanding of how to prepare children for this transition, through the daily programme. The coordinator aims to use <em>Te</em> <em>WhƒÅriki,</em> the revised early childhood curriculum, with educators to develop their understanding.</p><p>The service has developed a strategic plan in collaboration with management and educators. This plan is often referred to during regular meetings and workshops, contributing to transparent communication. A policy framework and budget guide service operations. The service has processes for internal evaluation and teacher appraisal, which management agrees both need reviewing and strengthening.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service recognises the urgent priority to develop an action plan to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an appraisal process that leads to improved evidence-based practice, builds leadership and meets Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an organisational culture that supports ongoing improvement through relevant professional learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and strengthen internal evaluation across all systems by evaluating the impact on children's outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Divine Foundation Home Base completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>22 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
