</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Papamoa is located in the suburb of Papamoa, Tauranga. The service operates under the management umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. It is a full-day education and care service licensed for 70 children from birth to school age. Children learn and play in three age-group areas, two of which share the same outdoor playground. Currently there are 75 children on the roll and 11 identify as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2012, the roll has stabilised and the centre is now operating at capacity, with more children attending for a greater number of hours. The centre manager remains the same but there has been several changes to the teaching team. In response to the area for development in the previous ERO report, teachers have been engaged in professional development focused on strengthening self review. They are also reviewing the centre philosophy to better reflect current priorities.</p><p>An ongoing focus has been the review and improvement of the outdoor environment to create opportunities for children to access more of the natural world. The centre is also exploring ways to learn about and embed aspects of the M&#257;ori world into everyday practices. A significant strength is the way that teachers and managers have increased the quality of relationships and connections with the parent and local community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers know children and their families/wh&#257;nau well. They provide them with a welcoming and caring environment and establish positive and respectful relationships. Children initiate play and are supported by flexible routines and responsive teachers who promote self-care and self-managing skills. Children with particular learning needs are responded to sensitively with the assistance of external support when required. A current focus has been on reviewing and enhancing provisions for infants and toddlers. These younger children benefit from caring and nurturing interactions, unhurried routines, and a high standard of care from their teachers.</p><p>The curriculum is generated from children&rsquo;s interests and preferences. Children have access to a wide range of resources both indoors and outside. They are encouraged to learn about the local environment including trips to the beach, growing plants, and learning about local landmarks related to aspects of M&#257;ori history. There is a strong emphasis on science, and children are able to inquire and investigate areas of interest, and persist with investigative activities over sustained periods of time. Additional opportunities for children to develop their physical skills include the provision of external, parent-funded programmes such as ballet and soccer.</p><p>Individual children&rsquo;s portfolios reflect their participation in centre activities and events. A recent initiative has been the use of an on-line programme to share learning stories with parents. This supports parents to be more actively engaged in their child&rsquo;s learning journey.</p><p>Teachers engage in a useful performance appraisal process with regular goal-setting and reflection meetings, and good quality support in the early stages of their careers. The centre manager has had a successful focus on rebuilding the recently established teaching team and providing opportunities for teachers to develop their leadership skills and share their knowledge. An experienced and knowledgeable Kidicorp Professional Services Manager and Business Manager provide valuable support and guidance for high-quality early childhood practice.</p><p>Well-developed and comprehensive policies and procedures guide centre operations with clear and useful strategic and annual goals that are aligned to centre operations. The recently developed teacher appraisal process is likely to have a positive effect on teaching practices and outcomes for children. Managers encourage centre leaders and teachers to engage in ongoing internal and external professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Currently centre managers are focused on building teacher professional capability to achieve consistently high-quality practice. To support this process, priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>establishing agreed expectations and indicators of best practice</li>
<li>providing ongoing feedback to teachers through regular, ongoing targeted observations for practice</li>
<li>continuing to refine assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Papamoa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Papamoa will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
