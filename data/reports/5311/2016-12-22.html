</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Una Williams Kindergarten is located in Masterton. It is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. This is the first review for this kindergarten since the merger.</p><p>The kindergarten provides education and care for children aged from two to five years. Six-hour daily sessions are offered, five days a week. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 30 children. At the time of this evaluation, nine MƒÅori and seven Samoan children were enrolled.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered. The programme is further assisted by support staff. Since the August 2013 ERO evaluation, a new head teacher has been appointed.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the Wellington association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning. Its introduction within the exRimutaka Kindergartens occurred during 2015 with kindergartens adapting it to respond to their community.</p><p>The August 2013 ERO report for the kindergarten identified that self review, learning partnerships with Pacific families and assessment, planning and evaluation needed strengthening. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of the kindergarten is evident in practice. Children's culture and language is promoted and celebrated. They have opportunities to work independently and are encouraged to take risks. Teachers work alongside children to support and extend their learning. Relationships are warm and responsive.</p><p>Teachers work well with families, whƒÅnau and external agencies to support children with additional learning needs. These children are fully included in the programme.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and Samoan language are highly valued and promoted in the kindergarten. Teachers use both languages in general conversation with children. Waiata MƒÅori and Samoan songs are popular learning activities. Children's cultures are appropriately reflected in the environment, resources and celebrations.</p><p>Strong relationships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori have been developed. Parents and whƒÅnau have many opportunities to participate in and contribute to their child's learning. WhƒÅnau expertise is used to extend the programme.</p><p>Promoting educational success for Pacific children is highly evident. A weekly play group for Pacific children and their parents is led by the head teacher. This provides an opportunity for the Pacific community to encourage their children to participate and learn with other children.</p><p>Teachers have drawn on the strengths of the head teacher and the kindergarten‚Äôs community to support their developing understanding of how to better reflect and celebrate Pacific cultures in the curriculum.</p><p>Planning is visible to parents and whƒÅnau on planning walls at the kindergarten. The current learning focus is linked to how teachers support children's interests. A key next step is to enhance the evaluation aspect of their planning. This should assist leaders to measure the impact of the programme to ensure positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Learning stories provide a useful record of children's interests, friendships and participation in the programme. Celebrating children's culture, language and identity are key features. Leaders have identified the need to strengthen assessment practice by showing clearer progression and next steps of learning for each child. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. They seek to improve the quality of education and care through use of ongoing, systematic internal evaluation. The head teacher promotes a culture of reflection and inquiry. The skills of teachers are valued and they are supported to take leadership roles within the kindergarten.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. They complete an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.¬†</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal process. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Una Williams Kindergarten, to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>deepen the focus of internal evaluation to encourage teachers to inquire into their own practice.</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice and strengthening of responsiveness to MƒÅori children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Una Williams Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Una Williams Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 December 2016¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
