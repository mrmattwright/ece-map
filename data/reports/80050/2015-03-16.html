</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dunstan Educare Ltd, Ngapara Street is one of two independently owned centres in Alexandra. One of the owners is the head teacher. It provides a full-day education and care service for children over three years of age. The children who attend this service mostly come from the second centre in Gregg Street. There are high levels of qualified staff.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy/vision is to support children‚Äôs developing interests and to promote a love of learning. As part of a centre-wide focus, children learn to care for the environment. Older children participate in a programme, two days per week that helps prepare them for going to school.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2011 teachers have improved their planning and the quality of children‚Äôs records of learning. The outdoor area has been extended. Improving strategic planning and self review continue to be areas for the centre to develop.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships at the centre are positive, caring and supportive. Teachers support children in respectful and inclusive ways. Children play well together for sustained periods of time. The staff work as a team to provide many learning opportunities for the children. Children are familiar with their teachers and freely approach them for support and acknowledgement.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to children‚Äôs needs and interests. They take time to genuinely listen to children and explore the deeper meanings in their learning. Teachers extend children‚Äôs learning through meaningful questioning and conversations. Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre and encouraged to share key information about their children‚Äôs care and learning.</p><p>Learning programmes often arise out of individual children‚Äôs interests. They have many opportunities for authentic learning through excursions into the local community and visits from adults with experiences and skills to share. A special feature of this centre is the depth and richness of group learning experiences such as visiting the local x-ray department to learn more about the human body.</p><p>Children benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>a bicultural dimension in the programme</li>
<li>readily sharing their mihi, learning about MƒÅtariki and legends and hearing some te reo MƒÅori</li>
<li>the many opportunities they get for music and movement and to be creative.</li>
</ul><p>Mathematics concepts are well integrated into the everyday activities and conversations between teachers and children. The centre is well resourced to support children‚Äôs mathematics learning. Many other activities focus on learning about how to care for the environment.</p><p>Individual teachers take responsibility for settling new children into the centre. A transition to school programme operates twice weekly to build children‚Äôs independence, confidence, literacy and mathematics skills. Parents appreciate the progress and success children have in this programme. Teachers have developed strong links with local schools to support children‚Äôs transition to school.</p><p>Children‚Äôs records of learning are useful. They clearly identify children‚Äôs interests, dispositions and what teachers will do to extend the learning. They also summarise the learning that has taken place over time. Teachers include children in decisions about the resources and centre environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of in-depth self review. They have carried out several spontaneous reviews to make improvements at the centre. Planned reviews should be carried out and documented. A schedule for self review would be useful.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs priorities and associated goals need to be reviewed to ensure the most important aspects for centre development are focused on and monitored. There should be closer links between the annual plan and the strategic plan.</p><p>Aspects of the indoor and outdoor environment should be reviewed with a view to improving general maintenance and presentation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dunstan Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dunstan Educare Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>16 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
