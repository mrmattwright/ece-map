</table><p>Awanui Playcentre requires further support to better reflect playcentre philosophy. Centre members should endeavour to implement an effective shared ownership and collaborative presentation of programmes.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Awanui Playcentre is a parent cooperative that serves a semi-rural community from a number of districts close to Kaitaia. It operates as one of six centres under the guidance of the Far North Playcentre Association which provides a policy framework and ongoing support. The well established centre is situated on the grounds of Awanui Primary School.</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide for 25 children, including up to 10 children under two years of age. It operates two sessions a week and is presently receiving support through the Association. The Centre Support Worker (CSW) lives in the local community, has extensive experience and holds a Course 4 Playcentre qualification. The playcentre‚Äôs roll is low and a number of parents attending have infants and toddlers. Two to four unfunded children attend almost every session.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs 2012 ERO report identified good features, such as ongoing parent education, a well presented environment and a variety of play opportunities for children. Children were making independent choices about their play and there were good systems in place to provide a safe centre environment.</p><p>The report also identified concerns, including the need to improve provisions for children up to two years of age, improve the planning cycle, enhance bicultural perspectives and practices, and continue to develop the centre‚Äôs profile in the community. Some progress has been made in improving these aspects of centre performance.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2012 review, the centre has received support to improve programme management and self review from the Playcentre Federation through a Ministry of Education contract. Support from the CSW will continue for at least a further two terms.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of four centre reviews in the Far North Playcentre Association.</p><p>The national playcentre organisation is currently in the process of a comprehensive restructure. While this will mean significant changes at the local level, it is expected that support for individual centres will be maintained or strengthened.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and adults benefit from the leadership and modelling of the CSW. Centre members and the CSW are starting to work together better to manage the centre and to provide activities and experiences for children. They have created spacious play areas indoors, particularly for the children up to two years of age. The well maintained outdoor play area has been designed to provide both challenge and safe spaces for children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Children confidently initiate play, requesting and accepting help from adults when necessary. Adults take care of children‚Äôs physical and emotional wellbeing and promote children‚Äôs sense of belonging in the centre. Some parents work with children other than their own during the session, but some chose not to participate in children‚Äôs play. The centre is reliant on external teaching support to operate sessions.</p><p>Centre members have made good use of the support they have received to record children‚Äôs learning. Their ‚ÄòDay Book‚Äô records what adults have noticed about children‚Äôs play during each session. This is a good start. Members could now make better use of this record by more deliberately adding and completing entries. This would enable them to make decisions about ways of extending and building on children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>Parents/caregivers also keep individual portfolios about children‚Äôs participation and development in the programme. External support has helped parents to make these records potentially useful for planning. Some good examples could now be used to provide a foundation for making links between assessments and planning. It would also enable more regular evaluation about how well the centre is supporting children‚Äôs learning, especially for the older children.</p><p>Some adults consistently use te reo MƒÅori with children in the programme. The centre library includes books in MƒÅori language or with MƒÅori themes. Children show understanding of te reo words and phrases used in the centre, and centre members indicate their intention of strengthening this bicultural focus.</p><p>At present the centre is struggling to fill its roll. Several families only attend one playcentre session a week, and take their children to other early childhood providers during the rest of the week. The lack of experienced members is placing undue stress on the few more able members. It is also undermining newer members‚Äô understanding of playcentre philosophy and their role in the cooperative running of the centre. These factors weaken the ongoing viability of the playcentre.</p><p>Parents have received support to develop self-review processes and have started to use self review as a tool for making judgements about ways of improving outcomes for children. These processes are in the early phases and need to be further developed to effectively support positive change. Centre members and the CSW talk about ways to strengthen membership and centre practices. Regular reports about progress in the playcentre and good informal communication networks help inform Association decision making about support and parent education programmes needed.</p><p>The Association‚Äôs strategic plan provides a guide for governance and is regularly monitored by office bearers. Management and governance processes are well established and are continually refined. The Association continues to consider ways to streamline planning and to monitor its support for the centre. Association office holders are highly committed to the playcentre philosophy and to maintaining playcentre as a valuable early childhood education option in the Far North.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Awanui Playcentre parents and care-givers agree that next key steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen their understanding and implementation of Playcentre‚Äôs philosophy of children and their families learning through play together</li>
<li>strengthen assessment and planning processes to more clearly record what centre members know about children‚Äôs interests and strengths</li>
<li>provide challenge, interest and quality interactions to support and extend the play of older children</li>
<li>support newer members to take on leadership roles so that responsibility for centre management is more evenly shared</li>
<li>align and streamline strategic planning, annual plans and action plans to monitor and affirm progress and to report to the Association.</li>
</ul><p>It is important that transition to the new playcentre structure for the Far North is carefully managed to ensure there is no interruption in parent support and education programmes in centres.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends, and centre members agree, that Association personnel should continue to provide close support for the centre as the roll grows and centre members become more self sufficient in the running of the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Awanui Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to centre management. To meet requirements the Association and centre parents need to;</p><ul>
<li>plan, implement, and evaluate a curriculum to enhance children‚Äôs learning and development through programmes that respond to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and capabilities, that include meaningful conversations, and that extend and enhance their learning and development individually and in groups¬†<em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2,C3,C4, C9]</em></li>
<li>establish, implement and regularly review the privacy policy and procedures, and appoint a privacy officer, to ensure that children‚Äôs, families‚Äô and employees‚Äô privacy is protected¬†<em>[</em><em>Privacy Act 1993, s23].</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre members, in consultation with the Association and the Ministry of Education, develop and implement a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Awanui Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
