</table><p>There is considerable work to be done in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>self review</li>
<li>centre leadership</li>
<li>staff performance management, including appraisal</li>
<li>outdoor environment.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Giggles Bizzy Beez was previously called Giggles Preschool and is a privately owned childcare service located in the business area of Te Puke township. The centre is licensed for to provide all day education and care for up to 40 children including 10 under 2 years of age. There are currently 33 children enrolled including 8 MƒÅori children. The centre caters for children aged from 2 to 5 years. Children under two years of age are catered for at Rainbow Kidz, which operates under the same ownership next door. The level of qualified staff in the service meets Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><p>The Giggles vision aims to provide ‚Äòan environment for children where they can feel safe, understood, loved, feel free to be themselves and children are encouraged to think outside of the square without criticism.‚Äô The philosophy is currently being reviewed in consultation with teachers.</p><p>A programme for 4 year old children is provided with the intention of preparing them for school. At specific times during the day all children have the opportunity to work in age-related programmes. The service owners are responsible for setting and monitoring centre direction and development, and teachers work together to manage the programme for children. Since the previous ERO review, some of the teaching staff are new to the centre, with the current teaching team being together for over a year.</p><p>Significant features of the centre are the highly transient nature of many families who under-take seasonal work in local industry. High numbers of transient Indian children attend for periods of time during the year. The 2012 ERO review identified communication, self review and leadership and management as areas requiring improvement. While aspects of communication and self review have improved these are still areas for ongoing development. At the time of ERO's review, centre owners were exploring ways to strengthen the quality of professional leadership for teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owners and licensee provide clear guidelines and expectations for the delivery of early childhood education and care. Administration systems are well developed and there are responsive procedures in place to monitor children‚Äôs safety and well being. The recent appointment of a part-time professional practice manager is contributing to a more consistent approach to teaching practice. This appointment is expected to improve teachers‚Äô professional knowledge and support teachers more effectively to deliver the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have recently been involved with externally facilitated professional development to strengthen aspects of their practice, including programme planning and the way teachers empower and respect children and families. Teachers‚Äô interactions with children are caring, sensitive and responsive to their needs. Valuable records of children‚Äôs participation in the centre programme are kept in individual portfolios, which are accessible to parents and children throughout the day. Portfolios could be improved to more consistently document individual children‚Äôs learning and progress over time.</p><p>ERO observed high levels of children‚Äôs involvement in play and learning. Routines are well managed by teachers and there are many opportunities for children to be engaged in sustained play by themselves or in groups. Recent review of programme planning processes has improved the effectiveness of teachers‚Äô planning and evaluation. The programme allows children to choose their level of involvement, follow their interests and revisit prior learning throughout the day. While the indoor area is well resourced and provides challenging activities, the outdoor area requires improvement to provide a more inviting, better resourced and a motivating area for children to explore. This area is now under renovation since the time of the onsite part of the ERO review.</p><p>The ethnic diversity evident in the teaching team is reflective of the ethnic makeup of the community and families. This diversity is contributing to children‚Äôs sense of belonging and well being. A MƒÅori teacher, fluent in te reo MƒÅori, is providing valuable modelling to promote aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Parents interviewed by ERO were highly supportive of the service, felt well informed about children‚Äôs progress, and welcome in the centre.</p><p>While processes for managing the performance of teachers have been reviewed and a new system is now in place, important elements of effective appraisal are still to be implemented. Such an approach is necessary to ensure teachers professional goals are clearly documented, monitored and linked to appropriate professional development opportunities. It is important that management continues to consolidate and embed the progress that has been made in improving the effectiveness of self-review processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that the important areas for review and development are to:</p><ul>
<li>improve the effectiveness of professional leadership for teachers</li>
<li>consolidate and embed planned and strategic self review</li>
<li>implement the new appraisal process for all staff</li>
<li>provide a more challenging, well-resourced outdoor learning environment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Giggles Bizzy Beez completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to self review, health and safety, human resource management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>the centre owner must ensure that an ongoing process for self review helps the service maintain and improve the quality of and education care it provides. [GMA6]</li>
<li>the centre owner must ensure that effective human resource management practices are consistently implemented, and outcomes well documented. [GMA7]</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Giggles Bizzy Beez will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
