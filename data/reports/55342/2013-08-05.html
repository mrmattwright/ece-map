</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Set in rural Hawkes Bay, Kereru Tots and Dots Early Childhood Centre provides a not-for-profit service where children, families and educators meet twice a week. One fully qualified teacher and one unqualified teacher operate sessions from 9am to 2pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the local community hall. The premises are shared with multiple community users, including the local school.</p><p>A parent committee governs and manages the small, rural centre. Many parents have strong community ties to the centre and nearby school. There is a current focus on preparing for the centre for relicensing to meet the requirements of the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>.</p><p>Since the June 2010 ERO report, the outdoor environment has been redeveloped and new fencing has been erected.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is highly evident in centre operation. A well stated vision promotes respectful, responsive and reciprocal relationships for supporting children's learning.</p><p>The curriculum is clearly based on parent aspirations. Children follow their own interests and teachers respond through skilful questioning to extend play and provide additional resources. Parents actively participate in the programme.</p><p>Teachers use a good range of effective teaching strategies to engage children in sustained learning conversations and activities. Positive, friendly and nurturing interactions are evident. Teachers support children to become independent and model positive guidance for parents.</p><p>Children show confidence in their interactions with adults and one another. Extended periods of cooperative role play are a feature. Older children regularly support and help their younger peers. Children enjoy success and are affirmed by adults.</p><p>A useful model of assessment has been developed for children soon to transition to school. Information, gathered about strengths and interests, is used well to set goals and objectives for each child. Parents are included in discussions about their child’s development and teachers share valuable information about progress in literacy and numeracy. Teachers know children’s strengths, interests and learning needs and provide programmes to match these. ERO considers that teachers should think about ways to extend this practice and improve assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Strong centre relationships with the local school, including reciprocal visits and exchanges of information about children’s learning, assist in their transition to school.</p><p>The physical environment is well resourced indoors and out. A good range of activity areas allow children to become fully involved in prepared activities. Outside, trees, shrubs and children’s gardens provide areas for exploration and foster caring for the environment. Fixed and portable climbing equipment promote challenge, physical play and development.</p><p>Warm relationships are established between teachers and parents. The committee works effectively to govern and manage centre operation. Members have a good understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities. There is a focus on improving learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers place emphasis on staying connected with the wider early childhood community. They participate in a professional development cluster of five rural early childhood centres, sharing ideas that lead to improved practice.</p><p>Staff have developed a sound framework for self review. The process is responsive to issues that emerge and is focused on the actions and development that follow. Information gained is analysed and used to make decisions that lead to improved practice and outcomes for children’s learning.</p><p>Useful formats for self and peer appraisal assist implementation of the recently reviewed process. An intention to link the process to the Registered Teacher Criteria is still under development. The first cycle of the new process is underway but not yet completed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further develop the strategic framework for guiding decision making by strengthening alignment of strategic planning with the vision, values and philosophy.</p><p>ERO’s evaluation indicates that self review would be strengthened through in-depth evaluation of analysed information. It would be timely to consider how effectively philosophy, policy and practice support Māori children's success as Māori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kereru Tots and Dots Early Childhood Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In 2012, the centre supervisor was not appraised by the Kereru Tots and Dots Management committee. In order to improve practice the Kereru Tots and Dots Management Committee should ensure that the centre supervisor is appraised annually.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kereru Tots and Dots Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
