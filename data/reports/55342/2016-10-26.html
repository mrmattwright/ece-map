</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kereru Tots 'n' Dots Early Childhood Centre is a community-based service, located in rural Hawkes Bay. Licensed for 12 children with one fully qualified and one unqualified teacher, it operates from 9am to 2pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the local hall.</p><p>The centre is governed by a parent committee. Day-to-day management is delegated to the qualified teacher (supervisor).</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of turangawaewae, mana whenua, manaaki tamariki and rangatiratanga and promotes a holistic approach to children's learning.</p><p>As the only early childhood service in the district, Kereru Tots 'n' Dots is a focal point for the community. Teachers and parents work collaboratively to maintain positive partnerships that promote children's belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Areas of strength, identified in the August 2013 ERO report, have been sustained and the areas for development, strategic planning, self review and supporting success for MƒÅori, addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Aspects of the philosophy are highly evident in practice. Children are supported to be confident and competent learners by initiating their own involvement in learning experiences. They are encouraged to problem solve and take risks.</p><p>The well-resourced learning environment fosters children's curiosity, exploration and imagination. Children have many opportunities to develop literacy and mathematical skills, knowledge and language in the context of their play.</p><p>Children benefit from a curriculum with relationships at its heart. Teachers know children and families very well. Their responsive, respectful and reciprocal interactions encourage children in their work and play.</p><p>Through implementing effective assessment and planning processes, teachers are able to successfully notice, recognise and respond to children's strengths and interests. Planning to extend children's learning is highly collaborative with parents and families regularly contributing their perspectives.</p><p>Visual displays and learning narratives ensure parents are well informed about curriculum experiences. Information is shared about children's learning and development in their portfolios that provide strong links between experiences at home and in the centre.</p><p>Teachers are a highly collaborative team. They reflect on the impact of the actions they have taken to promote positive outcomes for children. The supervisor is committed to ongoing professional learning and development to support the achievement of personal and service goals.</p><p>Bicultural values and practices are well integrated into the curriculum in authentic ways. Parents‚Äô and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children are sought and used to guide daily practices. The language, culture and identities of MƒÅori children are valued. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are integrated throughout the programme. Teachers have identified that the next step is to continue to strengthen their understanding and use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Highly effective transition practices support children as they enter the centre and when they leave to attend school. A positive working relationship with the local school includes regular reciprocal visits. These promote children's sense of belonging. Information about children's learning is exchanged.</p><p>Organisational leadership is well defined and effectively promotes the centre's strategic direction. Decisions about curriculum change are appropriately informed by research and examples of best practice.</p><p>Teachers clearly understand the purpose of, and the process for, internal evaluation. There is a strong focus on improving teaching to enhance children‚Äôs learning. Teachers make good use of internal evaluation to ascertain the impact of teaching and programmes on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Sound systems, policies and procedures facilitate consistent delivery of and a sustained approach to the programme. The appraisal process focuses successfully on strengthening teachers' professional knowledge and practices, with a deliberate emphasis on outcomes for children.</p><p>The governance committee is well informed about operation and teaching and learning. Committee roles were recently reviewed to ensure clear definition between governance and management expectations.</p><p>A clear vision sets direction for the centre and in promoting positive outcomes for children through high quality education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team has the capability to make sound decisions about development to maintain ongoing improvement. Continuing to strengthen their use and understanding of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori within the curriculum has been identified as a next step.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kereru Tots 'n' Dots Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kereru Tots 'n' Dots Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>26 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
