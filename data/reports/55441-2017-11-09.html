</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matiti Tokelau Akoga Kamata has provided early childhood education and care from a Tokelauan language and cultural perspective for over 20 years. It operates from a purpose built facility on the same site as St Bernadette's School in Naenae and is licensed to cater for 30 children including 7 up to 2 years of age.</p><p>The centre serves mainly children and families who are Tokelauan or Samoan, as well as children and families from other Pacific cultures. There is a smaller number of children who are Vietnamese, Somalian and Palagi.</p><p>The centre is spacious and well organised. Separate indoor and outdoor spaces are available for the older and younger age groups. Staff provide many opportunities for mixed age play. Babies and toddlers are well supported by their teachers to join older children for shared group play times.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes aganuku and gagana whaka-Tokelau. The philosophy is based on strong Talitonuga, Christian beliefs and values, within the Catholic faith. It uses Te WhƒÅriki, New Zealand's Early Childhood Curriculum, and encourages children's holistic development and parent partnerships.</p><p>Most teachers, including the pule takitaki, the centre manager, are experienced and qualified educators. All have strong connections to the Tokelauan community and are fluent in the Tokelauan language. An administrator provides effective support for the daily management of the akoga. A governance board replaced the management committee in 2015. It is well led and provides governance and management support for the akoga.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted many positive aspects about the care and education for children. However it highlighted concerns about the governance and management of the centre. This 2017 ERO report identifies that significant progress has been made in all areas within the past two years.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families experience a warm and welcoming centre environment at Matiti Tokelau. Children settle easily into the routines of the day and are content and secure with their teachers and friends. The centre environment is well organised and resourced with increasingly natural materials. Displays, photographs and artefacts reflect the Tokelauan heritage.</p><p>With a curriculum firmly based on aganuku and gagana whaka-Tokelau, children talk and sing in Tokelauan during the learning day. They experience positive, culturally appropriate interactions with their teachers. These good practices support children's strong sense of belonging in the centre and pride in their language, culture and identity. In addition, teachers show value for MƒÅori as tangata whenua incorporating te reo and tikanga in the programme.</p><p>Babies and toddlers experience nurturing and affectionate care from their teachers. Teachers communicate effectively with parents about the learning and other needs of their little ones and follow home routines and preferences. The environment provides natural and tactile learning resources. There is appropriate space and variety to invite children's exploration. In response to these good practices, children are settled and happy in the centre.</p><p>Teachers provide good support for children to play in areas of their choice. Children have ample space and time for uninterrupted play. Children play well with each other in groups or independently as they prefer. They are friendly and kind to each other and older children are especially caring towards the babies and toddlers. All children engage enthusiastically in group times organised and led by teachers.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively. They respond well to what they notice and recognise about children's interests and strengths. Children have good opportunities for literacy and numeracy learning in the context of their play. They also enjoy learning activities in science and the creative arts.</p><p>Learning stories include leo matua, parents' voice. and some show clearly what children have learned. Centre leaders identify that teachers would benefit from continued support to further improve the quality of learning stories. In particular they should consider how to make better use of parents' voice. They are also keen to promote the use of children's dispositions from a Tokelauan perspective.</p><p>Significant improvements have been made to the management and governance of the akoga. External expertise has supported these improvements. The centre is on a better and more professional footing. Improvements include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making roles and responsibilities for the pule takitaki and teaching staff clear and documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sharing leadership and management tasks across the teaching team, including appointing key staff to lead and improve the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>targeting professional learning to the needs and interests of teachers and leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a good strategic planning and internal evaluation / self-review model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and updating all policies and procedures and aligning them to legislative requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers value the opportunities for professional learning. They are using action-based research approaches to improve their practice and the environment for children. The teachers' appraisal system connects to this research approach and is aligned well to the Education Council requirements.</p><p>The governance board is led by a skilled and capable chairperson. He recognises that as the fourth chairperson in two years, there needs to a greater level of stability for the board. Currently, the board is seeking parent and community representation for the board.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing to the governance board reports that are more evaluative, showing the impact of work completed and next steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting inati / inquiry into the effectiveness of leadership throughout the akoga and from a Tokelauan perspective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to focus on the teachers' role in children's learning, identifying and applying deliberate acts of teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further supporting teachers to reflect on their professional practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matiti Tokelau Akonga Kamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matiti Tokelau Akonga Kamata will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>9 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
