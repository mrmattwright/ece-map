</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playhouse Childcare, located in central Wellington, provides all-day education and care for children aged between six months and five years. The majority of parents of the children are parliamentary employees. The centre operates as a non-profit parent collective. It is governed by an elected committee and supported by Parliamentary Services, with whom there is a memorandum of understanding that defines responsibilities about centre operation.</p><p>Since the February 2013 ERO report, centre staff have undertaken professional learning which has contributed to progress made in addressing the identified next steps.</p><p>Playhouse Childcare has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of children developing a strong sense of self and security through the provision of relevant and meaningful learning experiences and respectful practices. Teachers have established a learning environment that contributes to positive outcomes for children. The programme supports the development of the child's independence, their ability to problem-solve, make decisions and lead their own learning.</p><p>Children engage well in sustained play together. They are curious and enjoy the many opportunities to make choices and act independently. Children settle easily into the welcoming environment.</p><p>The specific needs of infants and toddlers are recognised and well catered for. They have access to an environment which allows them to move freely. Positive, nurturing and responsive relationships are evident between teachers and children.</p><p>There is a centre-wide focus on promoting active movement, healthy eating and sustainability of the environment. This focus includes the provision of resources, role modelling by teachers and collaboration with parents to maximise learning opportunities.</p><p>Children access a wide range of activities and resources that promote and extend their interests. They are able to challenge themselves and engage in exploration and imaginary play. Regular excursions into the local community enriches the curriculum.</p><p>Routines are responsive to the mixed-age group and support children to develop independence and self-help skills. Teachers provide support appropriate to children's ages and stages of development.</p><p>Teachers have participated in professional learning to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori perspectives. This is reflected in the environment and teaching practice. Teachers are developing programmes that affirm MƒÅori children's language, culture and identity and support their success as MƒÅori.</p><p>Strong partnerships are developed and families know they are welcome. Teachers provide additional opportunities for partnerships with families to support children‚Äôs learning, including parent-teacher interviews.</p><p>Planning for children's learning is based on teacher observations of children's interests. Children‚Äôs profiles are attractively presented records of their experiences at the centre. Daily planning focuses on noticing children‚Äôs interests and providing resources. Parents are actively encouraged to share their aspirations for their child.</p><p>There has been a strategic focus on strengthening the documentation of assessment, planning and evaluation. Teachers should continue to strengthen the responsiveness of planning for individual children and the range of strategies to extend learning over time. This should include evaluating the effectiveness of teaching strategies.</p><p>Transition to school is well considered and transitions within the centre are unhurried and responsive to individual children's needs.</p><p>Self review for improvement continues to develop and contributes to positive changes in the centre. Teachers now need to shift reviews from focusing on what they are doing, to evaluating how well teaching and learning practices strengthen outcomes for children. A key next step is to develop a framework to guide this process.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. They focus on providing high quality education and care for children. The skills and strengths of teachers are acknowledged and valued. The senior teacher is well supported in her leadership role by a parent cooperative.</p><p>The strategic plan provides overall direction for the service, with an annual plan clearly identifying priorities for moving forward. The senior teacher recognises the need to develop a succession plan for future sustainability and leadership opportunities. ERO's evaluation affirms this as a next step.</p><p>The appraisal process for teachers is under review. Teachers are encouraged to undertake research and to set goals. Regular meetings with the senior teacher provide opportunities for feedback. Refining the policy to include observations will enhance the quality of teaching. Links to Education Council expectations and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> should support staff to grow their professional practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher and leader agree the next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment practices</li>
<li>strengthen self review and evaluation with a focus on learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playhouse Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Playhouse Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
