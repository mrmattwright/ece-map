</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Playhouse Childcare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playhouse Childcare is located adjacent to the Parliament Buildings in central Wellington, and mostly serves the families of parliamentary employees. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 30 children, including seven aged up to two years. Separate areas are provided for infants and toddlers. Staffing has remained stable; leadership and many teachers are long-serving.</p><p>The centre operates as a non-profit parent collective. The senior teacher works alongside an elected parent committee to set the strategic direction of the service. It is supported by Parliamentary Services, with whom there is a memorandum of understanding that defines responsibilities for centre operation.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises relationships, respect and embracing diversity. MƒÅori concepts of whanaungatanga, kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga are prioritised.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs March 2016 report identified internal evaluation and assessment practices as next steps for development. Progress is ongoing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident. They experience warm, positive relationships with teachers who know them well. Belonging and whƒÅnaungatanga are purposefully and successfully promoted. Family involvement is welcomed. Children's home languages are valued and used. External support for children with diverse learning needs is accessed as appropriate.</p><p>The learning environment is inviting and well resourced. Active movement, construction and arts are strongly promoted. The curriculum is extended with cultural celebrations, family events and regular excursions into the neighbourhood and beyond.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a calm, child-led approach. Active movement and exploration are encouraged. Teachers gather and use rich information from parents about home routines, and are respectful of children's preferences. Warm, unhurried care moments are valued as relationship building opportunities.</p><p>Children aged over two years would benefit from increased opportunities to make decisions and grow their independence within the daily programme. Teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>investigate how to involve children in decision making about the structure of their day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide group learning experiences that are spontaneous, voluntary and responsive to children's interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify ways to support children to take increasing responsibility for caring for themselves, others and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review current best practice research about promoting readiness for school, using meaningful, play-based contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A good range of well-considered strategies are in place to support transitions into and through the service. This is a key strength. Systematic induction and information sharing processes foster confidence and familiarity for children and families.</p><p>Children benefit from a wide range of opportunities to see, hear and experience elements of te¬†reo¬†me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. The bicultural programme has been an area of focus and comprehensive development. Te ao MƒÅori is strongly reflected in the learning environment. ERO affirms centre plans to consult with whƒÅnau MƒÅori about ways to further localise practices for their tamariki.</p><p>Children's learning portfolios show that teachers know them well. Detailed observations of children‚Äôs play and interactions celebrate their strengths, interests and unique characteristics. However, the role of teachers in promoting the learning of children, through a robust cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation, is not evident. They should make better use of their good knowledge of children, their cultural contexts, and their parents‚Äô aspirations, to plan, enact and evaluate targeted strategies for individuals. This should be clearly documented.</p><p>Improving internal evaluation remains a next step for the service. As a priority, leaders and teachers should build a shared understanding of its purpose and process. This will mean focusing on the impact of practices on outcomes for children, rather than the practices themselves.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are highly reflective and improvement focused. They actively seek relevant research, professional development and networking opportunities to build their practices. Staff regularly liaise with neighbouring early learning services as professional cluster groups.</p><p>A useful appraisal framework is in place to support continual teacher growth. Some refinements to guiding documentation and a stronger focus on outcomes for children should enhance the process. Any potential conflict through the appraisal process should be avoided.</p><p>The management committee is committed and supportive. It meets regularly to monitor and progress strategic goals. Increased oversight of the review and implementation of policies and procedures is a next step for governance.</p><p>Staff wellbeing is valued and fostered, enabling teachers to focus on children. Distributed leadership and collaborative practices are actively promoted. ERO affirms this positive direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that priority areas for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to better empower older children to make choices and grow their independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building current understandings and practices related to school readiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playhouse Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, the management committee should refine systems to ensure the timely review and consistent implementation of all policies and procedures, in line with relevant legislation.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>10 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
