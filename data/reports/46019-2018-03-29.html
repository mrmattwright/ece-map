</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rumpus Room in Point Chevalier is one of two services under the same ownership. This centre is licensed for 49 children including 15 aged up to two years of age. Children play in two age-related groups.</p><p>The experienced centre manager is well supported by a team leader in the Fledglings and Explorers room. Together they share responsibility for the eight qualified teachers and the smooth operation of the centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy places children at the heart of all decisions and is enacted on a daily basis by centre leaders, teachers and children. Leaders have developed a strategic plan that acknowledges the importance of te Tiriti o Waitangi. They aim to provide safe, nurturing, supportive learning environments. The centre's aims reflect the Treaty principles relating to partnership with whānau Māori, the participation of tamariki and whānau in the centre, and the protection of the uniqueness of every tamaiti who attends the service.</p><p>ERO's 2014 review of the centre identified many positive aspects of practice. These included positive relationships, good records of children's learning and the development of effective governance and management. The report highlighted that the centre's areas for development were to develop consistency in teaching practices and improve the alignment between strategic and annual plans and centre practices. The centre has continued embedding positive practices and strengthening the areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children have a primary caregiver with whom they form a strong bond. This practice makes families feel more comfortable and assured that their children will settle and enjoy their time at the centre.</p><p>Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play and are able to make choices and explore from a variety of activities and experiences. The learning environment is attractive and welcoming. Children participate in experiences that support early literacy and numeracy learning.</p><p>Children under the age of two benefit from responsive and flexible care routines. Small group numbers help create a quiet and settled environment. Adults are now developing more challenging learning experiences for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have strengthened their commitment to raising children’s awareness of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Children respond well to basic te reo Māori phrases and sing waiata. Teachers value the diverse contributions that whānau bring into the centre, sharing cultural celebrations throughout the year. Children’s languages and culture are valued and promoted.</p><p>Families value the quality of learning their children experience. Parents express a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They feel included in their children's learning through their daily conversations with teachers, children's portfolios and their involvement in programme events. Parents value the opportunities their children have to explore their wider community.</p><p>The centre manager is growing the strengths of the teaching team. She sources professional development opportunities for teachers to grow and achieve their self-identified goals. She is confident that teachers' reflective practices and commitment to self review will sustain the quality of the programmes they provide.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The systems in place for centre operations, ongoing evaluation and support contribute to efficient management of the service. Teachers are guided by the centre's philosophy and the strategic goal to promote sustained development. Teachers use the appraisal process to identify personal goals and are encouraged by their leaders to be innovative and reflective in their practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders have identified useful next steps for centre improvement. These include continuing to develop:</p><ul>
<li>an inquiry based curriculum that builds on growing children's learning competencies</li>
<li>teachers' bicultural practices to support the success of Māori children</li>
<li>internal evaluation to guide centre improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rumpus Room completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Rumpus Room will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>29 March 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
