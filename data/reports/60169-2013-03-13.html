<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p><strong>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</strong></p>
<p>This service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Barnardos Education Learning Centres 218 and 216 Waterloo Road, Hutt City, provide all-day care and education for children aged between two and five years.</p>
<p>Since the February 2011 ERO report, restructuring of Barnardos has created positions for a new business manager and practice leader. These personnel support centre management. The head teacher of 218 Waterloo Road is also responsible for the adjacent centre at 216 Waterloo Road.</p>
<p>The Barnardos management and teaching team has systematically addressed the significant areas for improvement identified in the 2011 ERO report. Staff have reviewed their philosophy. They are working to ensure it is a living document. Teachers engage with self-review practices. Recent professional development has included children&rsquo;s social competence, early literacy learning and relationships with wh&#257;nau. Families have a range of opportunities to be well informed about centre operations and the education and care of their child.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children play in a settled and supportive environment. A positive tone and purposeful play are evident. The practice leader and head teacher support staff to develop children as independent learners. Children are encouraged to make play choices from a wide range of well considered resources.</p>
<p>As a result of self review, routines have been adapted to be responsive to children&rsquo;s individual and group needs. Children now sustain their play for extended periods of time. As teachers talk with children, they model and extend negotiation skills, problem-solving and critical thinking. The centre&rsquo;s curriculum is evolving to more effectively meet children's emerging interests and identified needs. Teachers keep priority learners in their focus and use staff meetings to consider strategies to support progress. Children who speak English as an additional language are well supported through the centre's literacy practices and teachers' conversations.</p>
<p>Well informed self review is contributing to building effective teaching practice. Teachers challenge themselves to focus on improvement and to ensure that the philosophy is enacted in daily operations.</p>
<p>A collaborative culture is developing with teachers regularly engaging in professional conversations about children&rsquo;s learning. This improvement focus impacts considerably on children and their learning through the positive changes made to assessment and planning.</p>
<p>The centre is well supported by the Barnardos management structure. The practice leader regularly observes centre staff and provides useful feedback. She gives clear direction for improvement. Changes within the centre have been well managed and focus on children and their families.</p>
<ul><li>Teachers are working to improve the quality of narratives in profile books and make links between these observations to provide continuity and complexity in children's learning. This and programme planning are identified by centre staff as areas for ongoing improvement.</li>
<li>M&#257;ori children are known to teachers. It is timely that staff review how well they cater for children&rsquo;s culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers acknowledge the need to strengthen bicultural practices so that all children better understand their place in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre Lower Hutt completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>

<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
