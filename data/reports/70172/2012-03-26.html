<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Edukids Kilmarnock is a privately owned centre situated in Riccarton, Christchurch. The centre is under the Kidicorp management umbrella. It provides all day care and education for children from birth to five years of age and is licensed for 69 children. The centre operates Monday to Friday. This is the first ERO report for this service.</p><p align="left">The centre manager, professional service manager and business manager provide a very good level of support and professional guidance to staff. They have high expectations for teaching practices and positive learning outcomes for children. The centre managers make good use of well-established processes that help them to reflect on their practice and focus on ongoing improvement.</p><p align="left">A feature of this centre is its diverse community. Teachers successfully provide many opportunities for staff and families to regularly celebrate and share their cultures with the centre.</p><p align="left">Other strengths of this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>children who are confident in making their own choices in the programme</li>
<li>positive relationships that teachers have developed with children, parents and wh&#257;nau that enhance their sense of belonging</li>
<li>teachers and children who enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and have fun together</li>
<li>teachers who work well together and communicate effectively</li>
<li>a strong focus on literacy, numeracy and creative experiences in the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children have many opportunities to experience te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the programme that helps them to become aware of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p align="left">This review was conducted during the time of the Canterbury earthquakes. The service has provided a good level of support to children and families to manage the impact of the earthquakes.</p><p align="left">The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for managers and teachers to support ongoing improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine and consolidate assessment and programme planning practices and strengthen aspects of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Edukids Kilmarnock was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atEdukids Kilmarnock.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO, this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s philosophy states that teachers will work in partnership with families to build on children&rsquo;s interests and learning. The centre aims to provide an enjoyable place for children to learn and an environment that values and respects children, families/wh&#257;nau and staff. Cultural diversity is to be embraced and celebrated.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">The centre managers and teachers foster inclusive and supportive relationships with children, parents and wh&#257;nau. Teachers regularly share information with families in useful ways. Many parents and wh&#257;nau are comfortable to spend time at the centre. Their contributions and involvement in the programme are encouraged and highly valued. Teachers provide consistent expectations and positive guidance that help children to develop successful relationships with others.</p><h4>Confident learners</h4><p align="left">Children respond positively to the teachers&rsquo; view of them as capable and confident learners. Teachers know the children well and are actively involved in their play. They work with children in caring and affirming ways.</p><p align="left">Children settle well at activities of interest with and alongside others. They generally share ideas, develop friendships and play together for periods of time. Children are encouraged to care for others and take responsibility for themselves and the environment. Many children make the most of opportunities to lead their own learning.</p><h4>Teaching strategies</h4><p align="left">Teachers are highly responsive to supporting children&rsquo;s interests. They provide good opportunities for children to investigate and extend their ideas. Teachers model respectful ways to communicate with children. They effectively support children&rsquo;s listening and speaking skills. Teachers make good use of questioning to help children build on their thinking and problem solving. Children&rsquo;s home languages are valued and used whenever possible.</p><h4>Programme in action</h4><p align="left">The programme strongly reflects the centre&rsquo;s shared philosophy for teachers, children and families. Children are familiar with and responsive to well-managed routines.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from the spacious, well-planned and resourced indoor learning areas. Purposeful and attractive wall displays inform parents about and involve them in children&rsquo;s learning. Children&rsquo;s individual profile books are attractively presented and include a good record of their learning.</p><p align="left">There are well-established approaches that are flexible and responsive to help children begin at the centre, move between the different areas and on to school successfully.</p><h4>Management and leadership</h4><p>The centre management, professional services manager, and business manager provide a good level of support and professional guidance. Managers provide useful internal and external professional development opportunities to extend teacher expertise.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders make good use of well-developed systems to support the effective operation of the centre. The individual skills and knowledge of teachers are highly valued.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to refine and consolidate assessment and programme planning and strengthen self review, including:</p><p align="left">In assessment:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly showing the next steps teachers will use to build on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>more clearly showing children&rsquo;s progress over time</li>
<li>continuing to develop links with schools to share useful information about children&rsquo;s current knowledge and strengths.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In planning:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly showing the impact of the planned programme on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In self review:</p><ul>
<li>further developing in-depth review and strengthening understanding of the impact of these on teaching practices and learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Edukids Kilmarnock completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>26 March 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-edukids-kilmarnock" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Edukids Kilmarnock</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Edukids Kilmarnock.</p><p align="left">Edukids Kilmarnock is a privately owned centre situated in Riccarton, Christchurch. The centre is under the Kidicorp management umbrella. It provides all day care and education for children from birth to five years of age and is licensed for 69 children. The centre operates Monday to Friday. This is the first ERO report for this service.</p><p align="left">The centre manager, professional service manager and business manager provide a very good level of support and professional guidance to staff. They have high expectations for teaching practices and positive learning outcomes for children. The centre managers make good use of well-established processes that help them to reflect on their practice and focus on ongoing improvement.</p><p align="left">A feature of this centre is its diverse community. Teachers successfully provide many opportunities for staff and families to regularly celebrate and share their cultures with the centre.</p><p align="left">Other strengths of this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>children who are confident in making their own choices in the programme</li>
<li>positive relationships that teachers have developed with children, parents and wh&#257;nau that enhance their sense of belonging</li>
<li>teachers and children who enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and have fun together</li>
<li>teachers who work well together and communicate effectively</li>
<li>a strong focus on literacy, numeracy and creative experiences in the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children have many opportunities to experience te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the programme that helps them to become aware of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p align="left">This review was conducted during the time of the Canterbury earthquakes. The service has provided a good level of support to children and families to manage the impact of the earthquakes.</p><p align="left">The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for managers and teachers to support ongoing improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine and consolidate assessment and programme planning practices and strengthen aspects of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region&nbsp;</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
