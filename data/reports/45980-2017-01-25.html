</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gem's Educational Childcare provides education and care for children aged three months to school age. There are two learning areas. One is designed for children aged three months to two years (The Nest) and the other for children aged two years to five years (The Hive). The service also offers a one-day-a-fortnight `farm school' experience for older children through a partnership with a local farm.</p><p>The service is licensed for up to 70 children (including up to 25 under two year olds). Children attending the service come from diverse cultural backgrounds reflecting the multicultural nature of the local community.</p><p>The service's philosophy states that it aims to support children to develop independence, initiative, imagination, curiosity and a sense of belonging.</p><p>The service, which opened in 2012, is privately owned. It has been recently rebranded and was formerly known as Little Rockets. There has been stable leadership in the service since the last ERO review in 2013. The owners (directors) lead the strategic direction and oversee the financial and business side of the service. Professional practice and day-to-day operations are led by a curriculum and operations coordinator and centre coordinator. Due to significant growth in the population of the region, the centre has a very large waiting list. In response, the owners are currently in the process of setting up a second centre nearby. Most staff are fully qualified early learning teachers.</p><p>The service works closely with the nearby primary school in order to facilitate smooth transitions for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a rich curriculum which is purposefully designed to respond to and extend their interests, strengths and developing abilities. Excellent use is made of the centre's well-designed indoor and outdoor environments to provide children with choice and challenge and to encourage their initiative, independence and creativity.</p><p>Teachers' interactions with children are highly respectful and responsive. They effectively model and promote positive social skills and self-management.</p><p>Children are well supported to feel confident and secure in the centre. Transitions into, through and on from the centre are carefully planned and managed. Children each have a teacher who takes primary responsibility for their care and learning. Close relationships are formed between these teachers, children and parents. This supports effective ongoing communication about the child's needs and learning and about families' values, expectations and priorities.</p><p>The primary caregiving approach is particularly evident in 'The Nest' where children aged under two years benefit from stable, nurturing relationships with their teachers. ERO saw teachers in `The Nest' respond calmly and sensitively to the needs and cues of children in their care.</p><p>Teachers carefully plan meaningful and rich learning experiences which support children's holistic development and early learning in literacy, numeracy, science and philosophy. New Zealand's bicultural heritage is thoughtfully integrated into the centre's environment and learning programmes. The service's focus on `learning-to learn' dispositions are well aligned with practices at the nearby school.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are continually reflecting on their learning programmes and teaching and learning practices. They are developing useful shared understandings about what is most important for promoting positive outcomes for children. They regularly share their learning and understandings with families.</p><p>Leaders have well-defined roles and work constructively together to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the leadership capability of staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make good use of teachers' strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentor and develop the capability of all teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lead and participate in professional development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>model and develop evaluative practices focused on ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>They have recently strengthened guidelines for the appraisal of teachers to support improvement and comply with requirements for registration. These will place more emphasis on teachers' own investigations into the effectiveness of their practice.</p><p>The directors have done significant work on identifying the vision and values of the service and building a service-wide culture based on respectful relationships. They have in place:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appropriate governance structures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a well-developed policy and procedure framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective systems for supporting the smooth operation of the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>They are committed to supporting the professional development of all staff.</p><p>The service has made good progress since ERO's 2013 review on developing internal evaluation practices. Multiple forms of internal evaluation inform planning and improvement at all levels of the service. These regularly draw on the perspectives of families, teachers and children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to improve outcomes for children, the service and ERO agree the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure planning for individual children identifies what is important learning and the strategies teachers will use to support this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure shared understandings about effective teaching and learning in this service are well documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the use of te reo MƒÅori across the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build the understandings of and capability for internal evaluation across the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure internal evaluation is manageable, purposeful and linked to valued outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further refine the service's strategic plan to better reflect strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gem's Educational Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO discussed with this service strengthening its emergency contingency planning for local and special excursions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gem's Educational Childcare will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu Southern</p><p>25 January 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
