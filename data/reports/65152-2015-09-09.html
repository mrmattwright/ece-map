</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre is known in the community as Rakiura Rugrats. It is the only early childhood centre on Stewart Island and provides a vital service for the community. The centre offers education and care for up to 20 children aged two-to-five years. In the past, when there has been demand and suitably qualified staff, the centre has also catered for children under two-years old.</p><p>The centre is run by a community-based trust with a parent committee. It receives very strong community support. The centre employs one qualified teacher. She is assisted by teacher aides and parent helpers.</p><p>The committee and teacher have made significant progress in proactively addressing the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs vision is to embrace the unique and special opportunities of Rakiura as the ‚Äòanchor stone‚Äô for the children‚Äôs learning. This vision can be seen in practice through the sense of belonging both to the centre and to the island shown by the children and their families.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is supported by a purposeful programme that reflects the island community and environment. A growing strength of the programme is the learning around New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage and in particular the heritage of Rakiura. The teacher includes MƒÅori concepts, such as whanaungatanga (sense of family connection) in planning for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Children also benefit from a programme that:</p><ul>
<li>responds to their interests</li>
<li>supports their developing oral language, literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>fosters their social competence and independence</li>
<li>encourages them to take responsibility for the environment and their actions.</li>
</ul><p>The teacher effectively leads the programme and guides teacher aides and parent helpers in their work. Parents are actively involved in supporting children‚Äôs learning in the centre.</p><p>The teacher, teacher aides and parents:</p><ul>
<li>know the children well and have caring and trusting relationships with them</li>
<li>listen carefully to the children</li>
<li>have genuine conversations with children to provoke and extend their thinking.</li>
</ul><p>The teacher ensures that the programme is responsive to the changing ages of the children at the centre. The centre has very close links with the school enabling smooth transitions. Older children in the centre take part in the newly-introduced bush programme along with children from the school.</p><p>The teacher regularly plans for groups and for individual children in consultation with their parents. The stories in children‚Äôs profile books are an attractive record of the range of experiences, developing dispositions, and episodes of learning. The teacher along with her external advisor has identified that planning could be simpler and profile books should better show how children‚Äôs learning develops over time. ERO agrees.</p><h4>Governance and leadership</h4><p>The hard-working committee members have taken useful action to ensure the ongoing sustainability and viability of the centre. It sought external support to build its own and the teacher‚Äôs capabilities. For example, they ensured there was an advice and guidance programme in place for the teacher and undertook training for effective self review and strategic planning. The strategic plan clearly indentifies the priorities and actions for future development.</p><p>In 2015 the committee contracted the Southland Kindergarten Association to provide governance, management and professional support for the centre. This has proved very useful, and ERO sees the value in continuing such an arrangement.</p><p>The committee and teacher work very well together to ensure the smooth operations of the centre. They have made good use of self review to bring about improvements. The committee has identified and ERO agrees, that the appraisal system should be further developed to better meet current requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>simplify systems for planning</li>
<li>better show continuity of children‚Äôs learning in the records of learning</li>
<li>strengthen the appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stewart Island EC Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stewart Island EC Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
