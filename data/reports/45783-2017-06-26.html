</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whakamaru Playcentre is located in a rural community south of Tokoroa and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre operates under the umbrella of the East Waikato Playcentre Association (EWPA) and is licensed for 27 children, including up to 12 under two years. There are 36 children enrolled, including four Māori. The centre is open for two sessions per week. There has been significant roll growth since the 2013 ERO review.</p><p>The centre philosophy values parents as first educators, children's individuality and the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa. Parents aim to provide safe and stimulating learning environments, and be true to their name: 'Whakamaru - to nurture and protect'.</p><p>The centre has responded to the need to strengthen planning, identified in the 2013 ERO review. The need for the EWPA to improve support and communication has also been addressed and parents feel the association is supportive and responsive.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently undergoing restructuring, and this has implications for EWPA governance actions in the future.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the East Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy warm, caring relationships with all parents. They play and learn in a mixed-age setting, and regularly engage in collaborative play with others. Social competency skills are encouraged, enabling children to interact constructively and develop strong friendships with one another.</p><p>Children are highly engaged and have fun learning and exploring in spacious, attractive indoor and outdoor environments. They are encouraged to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and wellbeing, and have many opportunities for safe physical challenges. Children have the opportunity to participate in a wide range of experiences, either following their interests or participating in parent-led activities. They are provided with feedback from parents that acknowledges their effort and success. Children demonstrate high levels of belonging and wellbeing, are settled and confident learners.</p><p>A broad, rich curriculum is in place with many opportunities for exploration and learning through play. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into the programme in meaningful ways. Children enjoy participating in cooking, gardening and science activities. Trips into the local and wider community are a feature of the programme. Children are developing an interest in, and love of learning.</p><p>The centre is well resourced with quality, age-appropriate equipment and activities. Parents use authentic contexts and collaboratively plan interesting activities each term, based on the principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Session evaluations identify children's developing interests and learning, and some possible extensions for future activities.</p><p>Infants and younger children are well supported by their parents to participate in the programme. They have access to resources that are appropriate for their age and stage of development. Parents have adapted the environment to ensure the safety of children who are crawling or learning to walk, and cater well for babies' and toddlers' individual needs.</p><p>Māori children and whānau benefit from the respectful, inclusive and welcoming culture. Parents have increased their knowledge of bicultural practices as a result of self review. There is some visibility of te reo Māori in wall displays and resources, and members are working to increase everyday use of the language. Each term's theme includes a bicultural focus, and parents and children visited the local marae last year. Parents agree there is a need to continue developing the way te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Easily accessible individual profile books record individual and group activities, and identify some dispositions for learning. Useful playcentre templates encourage parents to include learning outcomes for children and possible next steps to extend interests. A more consistent approach to including the learning that is happening in the profiles would support parents in building children's identity as successful learners.</p><p>Recent self review has resulted in improved practices to assist children's transition to school. Members benefit from the input of several parents with a background in education in understanding links between <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and <em>The</em> <em>New Zealand Curriculum</em>. This focus supports children's positive transition to school.</p><p>Parent education has continued as many members participate actively in playcentre courses. The centre facilitates and funds training at the centre for parents undertaking Course 2. Parents are proactive in seeking and using further training to enhance their role as educators for their children.</p><p>The EWPA provides useful policies and procedures for centre management. The centre is well managed, with a large number of elected positions and additional voluntary roles. Knowledgeable leaders encourage collaboration and use parents’ strengths effectively. High levels of commitment are providing the playcentre with a strong sense of purpose and direction.</p><p>Members regularly review each session and centre organisation. They evaluate the curriculum and the service's effectiveness in promoting best learning outcomes for children. Well-developed, self-review processes are resulting in continual improvement in centre practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members agree that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include goals in the strategic plan that identify and focus on improving learning outcomes for children. This should enable parents to more closely focus on expectations and aspirations for learning in the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the consistency in profile books of the identification of learning, to show children's development over time and success as lifelong learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen parents' confidence and capability to integrate te reo and tikanga Māori in the daily programme. This should develop the identity of Māori children in the centre more fully and provide other children with a better understanding of New Zealand's dual heritage.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whakamaru Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whakamaru Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato / Bay of Plenty</p><p>26 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children. </li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are: </p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education </li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
