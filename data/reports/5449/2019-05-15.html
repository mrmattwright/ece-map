</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Redwood is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Redwood is one of 69 early learning services governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The kindergarten provides for the education and care of young children from two years old to school age. All teachers/kaiako are qualified and certified. The association education manager (EM) provides consistent professional advice and guidance to support the effective operation of the service.</p><p>The kindergarten's vision states that children learn in an environment that values and supports uninterrupted and sustainable play. Children are seen as risk takers and strategic thinkers, confident and capable. A strong sense of manaakitanga (caring and respect) and whƒÅnaugnatanga (family, relationships, history, and traditions) are central to the culture.</p><p>ERO's February 2013 report noted that teachers needed to further develop and refine some aspects of children‚Äôs assessment and programme planning, and that bicultural practices needed strengthening. Internal evaluation processes focus on ongoing improvements to all areas of the curriculum.</p><p>This review was one of seven kindergartens in the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten vision of promoting manaakitanga and whƒÅnaugnatanga is very evident in the curriculum. Teachers foster respectful, reciprocal relationships with families and children. They actively promote a secure sense of belonging for those involved in the kindergarten community.</p><p>The language, culture and identity of each child is acknowledged, valued and celebrated. Teachers ensure that they know each child as a learner in the context of their family and home culture. They provide a bicultural curriculum that is meaningful for children and respectful of the MƒÅori culture. MƒÅori tamariki have authentic opportunities to succeed as MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers encourage genuine partnerships in children's learning with parents and whƒÅnau. They work collaboratively to respond to the individual interests, strengths and capabilities of each child. Specific resourcing, particularly for those with additional needs, provides valued support for children to build on their sense of wellbeing and success in their learning. Teachers are skilled at promoting child agency and independent thinking within the positive and inclusive learning environment.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association has a well-developed and clearly understood vision. It is underpinned by targeted strategic and annual planning systems. There are close links between the kindergarten plans, internal evaluation, appraisal and professional development. The teachers are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the priorities of the kindergarten and to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Since the last review, a restructure has enabled a key focus on education excellence within the kindergartens, and innovation and collaboration within the association and in the wider early childhood community. Key staff make a significant contribution to supporting other early learning services in Te Waipounamu / South Island.</p><p>The association has a very strong commitment to providing high quality professional development to build on leadership capacity and teacher capability. It has high expectations for teaching and learning and equitable outcomes for all children. This includes a strong focus on promoting understandings of and respect for te ao MƒÅori at all levels of the organisation. The association's internal evaluation practices are being well used to inform decision making and support the strong focus on continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the education manager and teachers agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the new team and embed a culture that builds on consistency of best practice and the valued skills of each teacher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed new appraisal processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Redwood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>15 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
