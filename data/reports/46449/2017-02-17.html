</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playdays Montessori Limited is a home-based service that is privately owned and operated. It is licensed for 80 children including up to 80 children from infants to school age. At present the service caters for 31 children who receive education and care from six educators in their own homes. All children are of Pacific heritage. The majority of children speak their home language and have been matched with educators who support this.</p><p>The service is led by the directors and an administrator. The financial and operations manager and the administration controller support quality services for children and their families. One of the directors is a registered early childhood teacher. Her role as the curriculum coordinator involves regular visits to educators' home to observe, monitor and support the quality of education for children. At present one educator has a teaching qualification and one has some relevant training. The remaining four educators are enrolled to start training in 2017. This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><p>The management's vision for the service is based on purposeful social justice. The philosophy embraces both <em>Te Whāriki, </em>the early childhood curriculum and aspects of Montessori education. This includes a focus on building children's independence and thinking skills. The service is committed to providing quality education through managed growth, and building educator capability.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy the provisions made for them in educators' homes. Their learning records show evidence of a rich curriculum that includes opportunities to explore, learn alongside others and have access to experiences and resources to extend their learning. Parents' aspirations for their children guide some of the content of educators' programmes. The coordinator provides good support to build educators' assessment practices, through individual coaching. She encourages educators to be reflective about their work and fosters a sense that evaluative thinking is important.</p><p>Sound management processes ensure that appropriate documentation, systems, policies and procedures are shared with parents. This well managed introduction to home-based education and care adds to the effectiveness of matching families and settling children with educators. According to parents' feedback, children form trusting and loving relationships with educators. Parents express their satisfaction about children's learning and the positive differences they see in children's knowledge.</p><p>The coordinator visits each child in the service once a month. Her visits include advice and support for educators. She helps them to identify children's interests and dispositions as learners and to plan individual programmes that promote appropriate learning. The coordinator models good practice and ensures that resources are appropriate and sufficiently challenging to engage children's interest. She promotes and supports excursions outside the home, making suggestions that strengthen the programme and children's learning.</p><p>The coordinator encourages educators to include the natural world and natural resources as part of children's play. The service's intention to incorporate Montessori ideals, such as self-management, as well as <em>Te Whāriki, </em>appears to operate well. Children participate in child-directed programmes as suggested by the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The service provides care for a small group of children up to two years of age. Appropriate ratios are maintained to ensure that educators are able to provide individualised nurture and support for these young children.</p><p>Management has high expectations that educators will provide quality education and care. To facilitate educators' ability to recognise good practice, regular opportunities are provided to attend professional learning and development (PLD) and attendance is encouraged by management. The coordinator stays up-to-date with current theory and practice by accessing external PLD with educators. She also provides access to articles and research to further encourage educators' professional practice. Ministry of Education PLD informs the programmes and includes New Zealand perspectives.</p><p>Educators promote children's culture, language and identity well. Continuation of support for children's home language is a priority for families and this aspect of programmes is strong. Educators successfully include children's home languages in learning journals and in online communications with parents.</p><p>Organisational management is thorough. The complementary team have created a culture of support and professionalism. The management team prioritises the development of good knowledge of regulated expectations, legislation and health and safety requirements, and the desire to manage growth and to focus on high quality provision. A comprehensive policy and procedural framework is in place.</p><p>Good self review ensures regular revisits, updating and modification of policies and procedures.    Self review is also used with educators to help make judgements about ways to improve their provision for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to support educators to:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly record children's progress over time in assessment records</li>
<li>use the service philosophy as a tool to review the effectiveness of programmes to promote positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>use curriculum documents as a way to prompt educators' evaluation of their practice</li>
<li>continue to strengthen educator understanding and use of English language in programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playdays Montessori completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Playdays Montessori will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
