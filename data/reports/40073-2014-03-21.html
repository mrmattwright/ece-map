</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ark Early Childhood Centre is owned and operated by the Waiapu Anglican Social Services Trust (WASS). It is situated alongside the Anglican Church in central Tauranga and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. Children learn and play in two age-related rooms - the whƒÅnau room for babies and toddlers, and the preschool for children over three. Supervisors are responsible for each age-related area.</p><p>The service now provides a programme for new mothers and their babies once a week. This programme, <em>Supporting Parents alongside Children‚Äôs Education</em> <em>(SPACE)</em>, is held in a separate, designated area.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the centre has been re-licensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. The license roll number was later increased and now caters for 62 children, including 25 up to two years of age. This increase was designed to accommodate children in the SPACE programme. At the time of this review, the roll for the centre was 49.</p><p>Following the resignation of the centre manager, an acting manager oversaw centre operations. A new manager was appointed in June 2011. She continues to be well supported by the previous acting manager. The WASS management committee is responsible for property, personnel and financial decisions as well as aspects of the centre‚Äôs special Christian character. An annual business plan is guiding centre improvement and the centre philosophy has been reviewed and re-written.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the experienced, long-serving staff who create a welcoming and positive culture for children and their parents/whƒÅnau. They continue to be engaged in a range of relevant professional development and have responded well to the areas for review and development in the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs vision, values and philosophy are clearly stated and bring an agreed sense of purpose and worth to all operations and processes. The revised philosophy with its emphasis on practical love and support for children and their parents/whƒÅnau, is now well reflected in centre relationships and interactions, documents, policies, planning, self review and staff appraisals.</p><p>Teachers establish caring and loving relationships with babies, toddlers and preschool children. They model appropriate language and engage in conversations that respond to children‚Äôs early attempts at communication. Literacy skills are encouraged and fostered throughout the centre. Teachers are increasingly using te reo MƒÅori and are involved in professional development to extend their knowledge of te Ao MƒÅori. Their practice is inclusive of children for whom English is a second language (ESOL), Pacific children, and those with special learning and behaviour requirements. Centre staff, supported by the Anglican Trust, are sensitive to the needs of children and their families within the centre and wider community.</p><p>The curriculum builds on the interests of children. Routines are more flexible and responsive to children‚Äôs needs. Teachers contribute their knowledge, skills and ideas to further promote children‚Äôs learning. They increasingly recognise children‚Äôs cultural identity and background and have worked hard to enhance the natural environment. Children help to arrange their play resources and initiate their own learning and play. There are effective and respectful transitions within and from the centre.</p><p>A planning process encourages teachers to reflect on prior learning, evaluate outcomes for children, and plan for future learning experiences. Learning stories capture these learning experiences for groups of children and individuals and are linked to the centre philosophy and children‚Äôs dispositions. Assessment of children‚Äôs learning could now include children‚Äôs voices and those of their parents/whƒÅnau. These will¬†further¬†enhance individual children's learning and development over¬†time.</p><p>Management and staff are committed to bicultural practices. The centre manager has also extended self review to include reviews of transitions-to-school, emergency procedures, and presentation of the resources and environment. The manager has supported and further developed professional practice, staff development and feedback for teachers. She has also strengthened partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau and is promoting a positive centre culture.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that the next steps for centre development are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>promote and embed te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme</li>
<li>foster shared understandings about high-quality teaching practice and include observations of one another‚Äôs practice</li>
<li>review areas of play to consider ways to further extend learning for children</li>
<li>develop the centre strategic and annual plan to include goals, timelines and evaluations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ark Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ark Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
