</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Homai Early Childhood Centre (HECC) is part of the Blind and Low Vision Education Network NZ (BLENNZ) campus in Manurewa. The centre caters for culturally diverse families from throughout Auckland. Some children and parents are transported to and from the centre by taxi.</p><p>The service provides three sessions during the week; a four-hour session on Monday, and whƒÅnau sessions on Tuesdays and Fridays. These sessions are for children who are blind, deafblind or have low vision, and their whƒÅnau, from birth to school age in small groups of up to 14. The Monday and Friday sessions provide an adapted and expanded core curriculum to support children to become independent and interdependent. Currently children attending the Tuesday whƒÅnau session have educational needs in addition to being blind, deafblind or low vision.</p><p>HECC has two full-time registered teachers and a part-time, fixed-term qualified teacher working as a Resource Teacher Vision (RTV). They are supported by education support workers, a taxi escort, the BLENNZ Coordinator Visual Resource Centre (VRC), and a team of therapists and professionals. The programme of learning for each child is also supported by their BLENNZ community RTV. The RTV assists with children's transition into community early childhood centres and schools.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Homai Early Childhood Centre Education Trust (HECCET). HECCET is made up of seven representatives of the BLENNZ Board of Trustees. Operational decisions are made by the HECC committee, which consists of the centre manager and teaching staff, along with support from the principal, senior managers, coordinator VRC and others when necessary.</p><p>The centre has a history of very positive ERO reports. In 2013, ERO identified high quality teaching practices, meaningful partnerships with whƒÅnau and caregivers, and improvement focused self review. These practices have been sustained. Next steps in 2013 included developing ways to make children's cultures more visible in documentation, and aligning policies with the early childhood licensing criteria. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's responsive and enabling environment is based around children's individual strengths, needs and abilities, and promotes their confidence and competence. Teachers view children's behaviours as communication. They use a gesture dictionary to help them interact with children in appropriate ways. Teachers communicate with children through gestures, touch, oral language, and sign language. These deliberate and effective practices promote trust and rapport between children, their teachers, and parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children access innovative and relevant resources, often made in the centre, to match children's developmental needs. They benefit from highly effective teaching strategies aimed at their holistic development including physical, language, literacy, numeracy, and life and independence skills. The programme at the centre reflects both <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and the <em>'Expanded Core Curriculum</em>'. This programme has been developed by HECC to benefit children in this unique context.</p><p>Children engage in a programme that responds to their strengths and needs each day. They attain maximum benefit from this sensitive approach. Children experience transitions that affirm their individuality, as a result of teachers' skilful management of change. Some teachers are confident with using words and phrases in te reo MƒÅori. The team confidently incorporates waiata and karakia during group times.</p><p>Most teachers make efforts to learn and use aspects of the home languages of children whose parents speak languages other than English. The team has given thought to being more deliberate with integrating home languages, resources and songs within the programme.</p><p>The centre's philosophy values strong relationships with children, and a whƒÅnau centred transdisciplinary and active learning approach. Individual planning is a key feature of the programme. The transdisciplinary team informs and consults with parents in making decisions about children's learning needs. Parents are informed about children's progress and ways to support children's learning on an ongoing basis. Transitions into other centres and schools are well supported, and parents are aware of the support that they can access for their children in these settings.</p><p>Teachers promote and implement the vision of BLENNZ and HECC and regularly evaluate its impact on outcomes for children and families. They are highly motivated to build their own professional knowledge and share this with others to improve outcomes for children and families.</p><p>A sound internal evaluation framework is used to document regular internal evaluations. These are focused on improvements in outcomes for children. Teachers consider improvements to teaching practice, curriculum, resources and environments, based on evidence. Parents are consulted as part of the review process.</p><p>Policies guide practice and reflect current legal and licensing requirements. Teachers could consider involving a core group of parents to contribute to and participate in policy reviews. The centre has made significant progress in aligning policies with the early childhood licensing criteria.</p><p>A distributed leadership model is used well to incorporate parent aspirations and the expert opinions of transdisciplinary professionals. This model provides cohesion between the various stakeholders and guides the learning programme for each child.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders agree that their key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen te ao MƒÅori perspectives and working with children from diverse cultural backgrounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporating parent perspectives more in their evaluation and in policy review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Homai Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Homai Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>22 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
