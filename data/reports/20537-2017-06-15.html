</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Manly Central, is licensed for 40 children, including up to 15 children up to two years of age. Younger children experience all-day education and care in a modified house known as Tiny Toes. The older children’s area, the Adventureland room, is purpose built. The majority of children currently attending are Pākehā, and the roll includes children who identify as Māori, Samoan, and South African as well as other ethnicities.</p><p>The centre is part of the national BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres. A centre manager and head teachers provide leadership and are supported by a professional services manager (PSM) and business manager and other BestStart management services.</p><p>Currently more than 80 percent of teachers employed at the centre are qualified. A manager of another BestStart centre is temporarily managing ABC Manly Central until a permanent appointment is made.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It acknowledges the centre’s responsibilities to the Treaty of Waitangi and promotes learning through play. A primary caregiver approach is used for all children, enabling them and their families to have an identified teacher as a main contact.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review commented positively on the relationships and interactions between teachers and children and their families. It acknowledged that the educational programme was responsive to, and built on, children's interests.</p><p>The report identified some key next steps including having a greater focus on supporting more complex play, strengthening planning and assessment, and ensuring that the cultures of Māori and other ethnicities were supported. Progress has been made in these areas. Further improvement is required to support older children to engage in more complex play.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the BestStart Educare Limited organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning and care is being well supported by the teachers. Children seem settled and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging at the centre. Teachers know the children well through regular communication with families/whanau. The primary caregiver approach works well. Parents are able to share information with the teacher who takes overall responsibility for their child.</p><p>The environment in Tiny Toes is calm and home-like. Teachers discuss children's home routines and follow these when appropriate. They work closely with children while giving them space and time to explore and learn at their own pace.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children encouraging them to follow their interests. The programme enables children to play for sustained periods. Teachers work alongside children, supporting their play through discussion and helping them to access resources.</p><p>Oral language development is well supported and early literacy and numeracy skills are promoted through play experiences. Children enjoy many opportunities to share books with teachers and each other. Teachers support children's inquiry into science related interests.</p><p>Teachers are working to strengthen and improve processes for assessment and planning. Parents are encouraged to discuss their aspirations for their child's learning with teachers. Teachers are looking for effective ways to include these in programme planning. An online communication tool is successfully being used to share assessment information between teachers and whanau.</p><p>The centre environment is well resourced and organised. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas. There is room outside for children to engage in physical activity that has sufficient challenge. Areas of play inside are well designed, including a quiet space for the older children.</p><p>Teachers include aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme and are building their confidence and competence in. They are also looking at ways to acknowledge other cultures of other children and families at the centre.</p><p>The centre is well led. The centre manager and the PSM work well together to support the head teachers in each room. They are developing leadership opportunities in areas of teachers strengths and interests.</p><p>Performance management is effective. Professional learning and development is relevant and engages staff. New learning is incorporated into teacher practice. Ongoing mentoring and coaching is used to build teacher capacity. BestStart's new appraisal process encourages teachers to inquire more into the impact of their teaching practice on children's learning.</p><p>Governance systems and policy guiding centre operations work effectively. A sound policy base is implemented through procedures determined by centre staff. Good systems are in place to ensure staff follow routines and complete health and safety checks. The PSM shares regular reports that identify strengths and any improvements needed. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and managers agree that staff should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning to ensure that the educational programme is responsive to children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of internal evaluation to guide on-going improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural and multicultural practices to ensure that the programme reflects children's cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities to develop leadership skills for all staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Manly Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Manly Central will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>15 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
