<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten is well supported by the association and the education service manager. The kindergarten is licensed for 45 children over two years of age and is located in the Parklands suburb of Christchurch.</p><p align="left">The teachers have made good progress in meeting the recommendations from the 2006 report. They provide good supervision and support for children&rsquo;s ideas and learning. Children are fully involved in activities of interest. Teachers&rsquo; use of effective assessment practices helps them to identify and respond to children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and capabilities.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from a well organised environment. Teachers offer many opportunities for children to learn about the benefits of physical play and to explore the natural world. Parents and teachers work together to involve children in creating a sustainable environment.</p><p align="left">Teachers foster respectful and inclusive relationships with children and their families. During the review, ERO observed independent and confident children. Children also played collaboratively with and alongside their peers. They were encouraged to take responsibility for others and the environment.</p><p align="left">Other key features of the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the significant involvement of parents and wh&#257;nau in the programme;</li>
<li>the establishment of strong links with the local and wider community;</li>
<li>informative displays of children&rsquo;s learning;</li>
<li>an ongoing commitment to professional development and to the continuous improvement of bicultural and multicultural practices; and</li>
<li>well-developed, and collaborative self-review processes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO and teachers agree that the next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children are for teachers to extend:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on teaching and learning in programme evaluations; and</li>
<li>strategies to develop children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning skills.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the on-site stage of the review, ERO identified no areas of non-compliance. Teachers follow effective association systems to ensure the provision of a healthy and safe environment for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands .</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten vision statement states that they will provide a safe and warm, welcoming environment where children will be viewed as unique individuals. Children will be treated with respect and valued by the teaching team. It also states that teachers will provide an environment where biculturalism and multiculturalism are an integral part of the curriculum.</p><h3 align="left">Areas of strength</h3><h4>Environment</h4><p align="left">Teachers provide a well organised environment that captures the interests of children and encourages their involvement in the programme. Children have easy access to a good range of resources to support their learning. They are actively involved in the natural outside area that offers many opportunities for physical play and exploration.</p><p align="left">Parents/wh&#257;nau and teachers work together to help children understand and make meaningful links to the natural world and to create a sustainable environment. Natural areas, including a worm farm, are a prominent feature of the inside area.</p><h4>Relationships and interactions</h4><p align="left">Teachers foster positive and inclusive relationships with children and families. They know the children and families well. Teachers have a calm manner that fosters children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and sense of belonging. Children&rsquo;s interests and needs are responded to in caring and respectful ways. They benefit from positive and consistent guidance that supports them in confidently making choices and managing their own behaviours.</p><p align="left">Children play cooperatively with and alongside their peers. Teachers encourage children to be independent and to take responsibility for others and for the environment. Children benefit from relaxed kai (meal) routines. Teachers sit with children and encourage self-help skills, conversations and healthy eating.</p><p align="left">Teachers foster professional links with local schools, especially the adjacent school, to help children and their families make a smooth transition to school.</p><h4>Parent contribution</h4><p align="left">Teachers value the significant contribution that parents and wh&#257;nau make to children&rsquo;s learning. Many parents are actively involved in adding value to the programme through sharing their knowledge and skills. Some parents provide valuable bicultural and multicultural perspectives that support children&rsquo;s understandings of diversity.</p><p align="left">Teachers have developed strong links with the community. Parents assist with excursions that enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><h4>Programme</h4><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s current interests and significant happenings at the kindergarten are highly visible in the environment. Teachers create attractive and informative wall displays that are purposefully placed to maximise opportunities for families to revisit and contribute to events. Children have easy access to well-presented profiles containing regular assessments that encourage and affirm children&rsquo;s interests, skills, and capabilites.</p><p align="left">Teachers plan learning experiences in response to noticing children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They value diversity and have an ongoing commitment to integrating bicultural and multicultural perspectives into the programme.</p><h4>Self review</h4><p align="left">Teachers make effective use of self review to improve the programme and practices. They follow clear and systematic processes. Teachers seek the view of parents and use this information to make changes that will benefit children. They demonstrate an ongoing commitment to developing reflective practice and building their knowledge and capabilities.</p><h3>Areas for development</h3><h4>Extending teaching and learning</h4><p align="left">ERO, the education service manager and teachers agree that the next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children are for teachers to extend:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on teaching and learning in programme evaluations;</li>
<li>opportunities for sustained teaching interactions;</li>
<li>strategies for developing children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning skills;</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s voices in assessments, the programme and self review; and</li>
<li>the support for children to use technologies for research and the presentation of ideas and experiences.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topics" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topics</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Literacy Teaching and Learning</h4><p align="left">When children understand, enjoy, engage with, and use language and symbols they are better able to express their individual identity and become active participants in a literate society. As part of this review ERO looked at literacy practices, particularly the opportunities provided for children to develop strong literacy learning foundations.</p><p align="left">In this service children&rsquo;s literacy learning opportunities included:</p><ul>
<li>encouraging children to be confident communicators;</li>
<li>integrating literacy in all areas of the curriculum;</li>
<li>a literacy curriculum that fosters bicultural and multicultural values;</li>
<li>working with families in ways that value their first language;</li>
<li>supporting each child as they choose to engage in writing or reading text and letters/symbols;</li>
<li>learning stories that are written in a narrative format to encourage children to revisit and share their experiences;</li>
<li>tools for literacy such as pens, pencils and books, music, stories;</li>
<li>teachers role modelling reading and writing;</li>
<li>provisions for children&rsquo;s dramatic and imaginative play;</li>
<li>children telling their personal oral stories;</li>
<li>a new entrant teacher from the adjacent school reading to children and introducing them to a phonetic programme used at school; and</li>
<li>literacy as a whole team self-review focus.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-parklands" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands .</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Parklands is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten is well supported by the association and the education service manager. The kindergarten is licensed for 45 children over two years of age and is located in the Parklands suburb of Christchurch.</p><p align="left">The teachers have made good progress in meeting the recommendations from the 2006 report. They provide good supervision and support for children&rsquo;s ideas and learning. Children are fully involved in activities of interest. Teachers&rsquo; use of effective assessment practices helps them to identify and respond to children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and capabilities.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from a well organised environment. Teachers offer many opportunities for children to learn about the benefits of physical play and to explore the natural world. Parents and teachers work together to involve children in creating a sustainable environment.</p><p align="left">Teachers foster respectful and inclusive relationships with children and their families. During the review, ERO observed independent and confident children. Children also played collaboratively with and alongside their peers. They were encouraged to take responsibility for others and the environment.</p><p align="left">Other key features of the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the significant involvement of parents and wh&#257;nau in the programme;</li>
<li>the establishment of strong links with the local and wider community;</li>
<li>informative displays of children&rsquo;s learning;</li>
<li>an ongoing commitment to professional development and to the continuous improvement of bicultural and multicultural practices; and</li>
<li>well-developed, and collaborative self-review processes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO and teachers agree that the next steps to further improve learning outcomes for children are for teachers to extend:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on teaching and learning in programme evaluations; and</li>
<li>strategies to develop children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning skills.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the on-site stage of the review, ERO identified no areas of non-compliance. Teachers follow effective association systems to ensure the provision of a healthy and safe environment for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p></html>
