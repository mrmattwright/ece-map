</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Takanini Early Learning Centre, previously known as Kids Count, Takanini is licensed for 50 children over two years of age. Most children are of Māori heritage, and there are smaller numbers of children from Pacific nations. The centre offers sessional and full-time care, education and programmes.</p><p>The centre's philosophy values the bicultural heritage of New Zealand, focuses on the right of every child to reach their potential and has a commitment to working in partnership with parents. Most of the children enrolled use the centre's free transport service and attend sessions for 20 hours a week.</p><p>Staffing continues to be stable. A long serving staff member became the centre manager in 2015. The centre employs nine staff. They include five qualified teachers, three of whom are fully certificated. The centre operates two age related rooms, one for the two to three year olds and one for the four year olds. Each room is led by a head teacher.</p><p>Takanini Early Learning Centre operates under the umbrella of the Evolve Education Group. Evolve organisation provides a policy and management framework and a range of support systems, to meet the needs of each service. Daily centre operations are delegated to the centre manager. Occasional cluster meetings with other Evolve centres provide a support network for centre leaders.</p><p>The centre manager and staff have made some progress in the development areas identified in the 2014 ERO report. These include implementing more robust self review, improving annual planning and continuing to build learning partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews of services in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy opportunities to learn alongside their peers and with adults. They share warm relationships with teachers, settle quickly, and develop social skills through friendships. Children are encouraged to learn self-management through routines and positive guidance.</p><p>Teachers provide a variety of activities for children to learn early literacy and mathematics skills. The environment reflects a bicultural curriculum and the languages and cultures of the children. Teachers should continue to review how teaching practices could extend children's learning and language development.</p><p>Teachers are developing a shared understanding of a child-centred curriculum. They work collaboratively as a team to support children's wellbeing. Teachers know children well and access external assistance to ensure that children with special needs and their families are appropriately supported. Programme planning is based on observations of children's interests and strengths. Records of children's learning are variable in quality. Teachers should continue to develop their reflective practice to improve the overall quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>Teachers have recently developed internal evaluation processes that are influencing the strategic direction of the centre. Staff are continuing to strengthen parent and whānau participation in children's learning. Teachers should continue to deepen internal evaluation to improve outcomes for children and build individual children's capacity to lead their own learning. They should review the transition to school programme to build on children's dispositions for learning and provide more opportunities to challenge children's thinking.</p><p>The centre manager has established a teacher appraisal process that meets Education Council requirements and is aligned to the strategic plan. There is good mentoring support in place to assist provisionally certificated teachers to progress to full certification. External mentoring for staff would be beneficial for continuing to develop their leadership capability.</p><p>The Evolve Education Group is in a phase of continuing growth and development. A strategic vision and plan have been developed and provide a starting point for each centre's strategic planning. The organisation has a strong commitment to consultation with the community of each centre, to the professional development of staff and to the integration of bicultural practices throughout the service.</p><p>This ERO review finds that improved networking and support from within the Evolve Education Group should support staff to progress and sustain these early developments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that next steps for centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>professional development for teachers to support the implementation of an effective internal evaluation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum leadership that enables teachers to deepen and embed quality teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve leaders recognise that they need to place a stronger focus on the quality of teaching in order to improve outcomes for children. They plan to clarify leadership roles and review systems for teachers' performance management.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Takanini Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Takanini Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>31 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
