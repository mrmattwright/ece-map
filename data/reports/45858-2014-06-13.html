</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ecokids Early Childhood Education is a privately owned centre based in Raureka, Hastings. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 49 children, including ten up to two years old. The centre has a focus on environmental sustainability.</p><p>Ecokids Early Childhood Education opened in 2012. This is its first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show confidence and high levels of independence. They play harmoniously alongside their peers. Adults support their developing skills and extend their thinking and language. They use routines effectively as learning opportunities.</p><p>Positive and caring relationships are a feature of the centre. Parents are warmly welcomed and their views are valued. Children approach adults confidently and staff respond to their comments and requests with warmth and interest.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They use this knowledge effectively to make connections to promote children‚Äôs thinking. They have a proactive approach to supporting children with special needs.</p><p>Children frequently revisit previous activities and learning captured in their portfolios. These are easily accessible for parents and children and are a useful record of their interests and development. Managers agree that consistency in assessing individual children‚Äôs learning over time needs strengthening. This will assist teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs commitment to eco-friendly practices is evident. The environment is well resourced to engage children‚Äôs interest in the natural world. Teachers support children‚Äôs learning, including their mathematical understanding, as they harvest produce together. Children enjoy experimenting with natural materials in their creative play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured and encouraged to explore their surroundings. Responsive caregiving supports their need for secure attachments and encourages their language development. Good information sharing between families and staff enables continuity in care routines.</p><p>Resources that affirm MƒÅori children‚Äôs cultural identity are visible and accessible to children. Teachers have accessed external support to further developing their understanding of ways of teaching that reflect and respond to MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Self review as a tool to drive ongoing improvement is developing. Teachers‚Äô professional learning and development is carefully selected and its impact is evident in teacher practice.</p><p>Leadership is supportive and collaborative. Well-developed systems and processes provide clear expectations for centre operations. ERO‚Äôs evaluation identifies and managers agree that the introduction of success indicators and clearly identified outcomes is likely to strengthen strategic planning and support ongoing improvements in the quality of education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps, to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen consistency in teacher assessment of children‚Äôs learning, and evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching</li>
<li>strengthen strategic planning, including the use of success indicators and clearly identified outcomes, to support ongoing improvements that improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ecokids Early Childhood Education completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ecokids Early Childhood Education will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>13 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
