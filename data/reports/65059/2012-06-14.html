<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1.&nbsp;The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Ready Steady Play Early Learning Centre provides good-quality care and education for children from two to five years of age. The centre occupies one wing of a modern, purpose-built preschool. Within the same complex is Ready Steady Babies, which operates on a different licence. ERO reviewed both of these centres at the same time. The four separate rooms effectively cater to the specific learning and development needs of children. Educators work well together to provide smooth transitions between areas. They share information that supports the well-being and sense of belonging of children, parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">This review was conducted during the time of the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. The service has provided a high level of support to educators, children and families to manage the impact of the earthquakes.</p><p align="left">A feature of this centre is its primary focus on building positive relationships as a basis for learning. Educators model care and respect for one another and for children, parents and wh&#257;nau. Other strengths of this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>the child-centred programme where children&rsquo;s interests and learning are well supported</li>
<li>the focus on independence, literacy, numeracy and music in the programme</li>
<li>children playing well with others, sharing ideas and developing friendships</li>
<li>the attractive, well-organised and resourced learning areas that encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration</li>
<li>the opportunities for children to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Educators integrate te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the programme in ways that help children to become aware of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p align="left">The licensee/supervisor and educators have developed a reflective culture and have high expectations for teaching practices and children&rsquo;s learning. The licensee/supervisor has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step to support ongoing improvement is to strengthen self-review practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Ready Steady Play Early Learning Centre Early Learning Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atReady Steady Play Early Learning Centre Early Learning Centre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO, this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s philosophy and shared vision have a primary focus on relationships as the basis for learning and resourcing that inspires a sense of wonder. Educators model care and respect for one another and for children. They give priority to fostering a relationship-based practice that supports a strong sense of well-being and belonging for children and families.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">During the review, ERO observed educators responding to children&rsquo;s individual interests and needs through unhurried, calm and positive interactions. Educators worked with children in ways that were inclusive, respectful and caring. They were consistently involved in children&rsquo;s play and encouraged children&rsquo;s independence. Educators listened well to children and promoted children&rsquo;s oral language. Children played well with and alongside others. They shared ideas, enjoyed each other&rsquo;s company and friendship.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from educators&rsquo; consistent expectations and guidance. Children are encouraged to take responsibility for the environment and to care for others.</p><p align="left">Educators integrate tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori into the programme in ways that are meaningful to children and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p align="left">Educators and parents share information to make purposeful links between home and the centre. Attractive and purposeful wall displays and profile books keep parents well informed about children&rsquo;s learning, their interests and participation in the programme. Parents have many opportunities to contribute and suggest areas for their child&rsquo;s future learning.</p><p align="left">Educators make effective use of the four separate areas, across the two centre licences, to group children in ways that meet their specific learning and development needs. Well-organised, attractive learning areas provide a wide range of good quality resources and learning experiences that encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and investigation.</p><p align="left">The centre philosophy influences a strong focus on the use of natural materials and the integration of bicultural perspectives. Outside spaces are flexible to allow for older children to play with younger children and for siblings to spend time together. Children benefit from many opportunities to be involved in physical challenges and to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</p><p align="left">The programme is effective in supporting children to make their own choices, explore their ideas and remain involved for long periods of time. Children have easy access to a wide range of good quality learning experiences that promote learning. Educators place an appropriate emphasis on the provision of literacy and numeracy experiences in the programme. They also place a strong focus on the provision of enjoyable musical experiences for children. Educators make effective use of the local community to enhance the learning programme.</p><p align="left">Consistency of programme planning across the two centres supports children&rsquo;s transition into the centre, between rooms and on to other centres. Educators make purposeful links to local schools to support positive transitions and the sharing of useful information about children&rsquo;s strengths and learning interests.</p><p align="left">The licensee/supervisor demonstrates effective leadership and management skills. She has developed management practices that are inclusive and effective in using the strengths of the staff to benefit children and families. Appraisal and professional development are well linked, helping to support educators to grow their professional practice. The licensee/supervisor and educators are building a reflective culture that is strongly focused on improvement and positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The licensee/supervisor has identified the need to further develop the centre&rsquo;s self-review practices. She has developed a self-review process that should bring together the reflective practices of educators and effectively guide formal self review in the centre. The next steps are to:</p><p align="left">fully analyse the outcomes of each review, identify the next steps that should be taken to improve practice, and monitor the impact on teaching practices and learning outcomes for children</p><p align="left">develop a review plan that gives priority to future areas for review.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Ready Steady Play Early Learning Centre Early Learning Centre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>14 June 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-ready-steady-play-early-learning-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Ready Steady Play Early Learning Centre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Ready Steady Play Early Learning Centre.</p><p align="left">Ready Steady Play Early Learning Centre provides good-quality care and education for children from two to five years of age. The centre occupies one wing of a modern, purpose-built preschool. Within the same complex is Ready Steady Babies, which operates on a different licence. ERO reviewed both of these centres at the same time. The four separate rooms effectively cater to the specific learning and development needs of children. Educators work well together to provide smooth transitions between areas. They share information that supports the well-being and sense of belonging of children, parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">This review was conducted during the time of the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. The service has provided a high level of support to educators, children and families to manage the impact of the earthquakes.</p><p align="left">A feature of this centre is its primary focus on building positive relationships as a basis for learning. Educators model care and respect for one another and for children, parents and wh&#257;nau. Other strengths of this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>the child-centred programme where children&rsquo;s interests and learning are well supported</li>
<li>the focus on independence, literacy, numeracy and music in the programme</li>
<li>children playing well with others, sharing ideas and developing friendships</li>
<li>the attractive, well-organised and resourced learning areas that encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration</li>
<li>the opportunities for children to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Educators integrate te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the programme in ways that help children to become aware of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p align="left">The licensee/supervisor and educators have developed a reflective culture and have high expectations for teaching practices and children&rsquo;s learning. The licensee/supervisor has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step to support ongoing improvement is to strengthen self-review practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b>&nbsp;&ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b>&nbsp;&ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b>&nbsp;&ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
