</table><p>While well placed, with additional support to build the capability and capacity the centre will become better placed to further improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Elim Kiwikids Childcare Preschool is located behind the Elim Christian Centre in Stoke. This church-owned service provides education and care for up to 40 children, including 13 aged up to two years. The centre is arranged with separate spaces for children under two and older children, each with its own outdoor play area. Plans are in place for the ongoing development of the facilities.</p><p>As part of the church community, the centre's mission includes supporting the local community and families. Since the 2013 ERO review, there are more families from a wider range of cultures using the service.</p><p>The centre has a governance team with representatives from parents, the centre and the church. The centre operates under the leadership of a manager, supported by an assistant manager and a team of teachers. Most of the staff who were present at the time of the 2013 ERO review remain at the centre. Many work part time. This centre aims to be known as one which trains and develops early childhood teachers. As a result, there is a range of qualification levels among staff from untrained teachers to teachers in training, to fully qualified staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy, including Christian values, are visible in the environment and well reflected in practices. Staff members provide children and their families with a welcoming environment.</p><p>Staff members focus on promoting positive, nurturing, comforting relationships with children. Conversations between teachers and children are respectful and adults encourage children to participate in the programme.</p><p>Staff members provide children with a wide range of engaging play activities and learning experiences. They make good use of excursions in the local community, and visitors to the centre, to extend children's understandings of their local and wider community and the people within it.</p><p>Children are actively engaged in a calm, settled environment. Staff members regularly notice children's interests and extend on these effectively through the programme. Staff make appropriate efforts to recognise and celebrate children's languages and cultures, including Māori and Pacific.</p><p>The centre is effectively increasing its links with local schools to better support children as they make the transition from early childhood to primary schooling.</p><p>An important part of the centre philosophy is promoting positive relationships with families and providing additional support and links to other agencies when needed. The environment is inclusive for staff and children and provides good opportunities for children to see people's unique talents and qualities recognised and appreciated.</p><p>The centre has a strong commitment to supporting student teachers in training. This is assisted by a supportive andencouraging environment among teachers.</p><p>Teachers have used self review to regularly reflect on and make positive changes to aspects of their practice and centre policies. They have made good use of research to inquire into practice and ongoing professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>There is a well-defined governance and management structure supporting centre operations and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Staff members at this centre have a wide range of experience and qualifications in early childhood education. They are at varying levels in their understanding on how to best support children's learning. ERO recommends:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment and planning practices, including developing clearer guidelines for staff on expectations for learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting staff to use a wider range of teaching strategies to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing appraisal procedures that better align with Education Council guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing clearer procedures to guide practice for self review so that staff capacity to undertake robust self review is supported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the governance board's strategic planning practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has requested an action plan of how the service provider plans to address the next steps identified in this report.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the centre works with the Ministry of Education to seek external professional learning and development to support the improvement of planning, assessment and self-review practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elim Kiwikids Childcare Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the onsite stage of the review ERO identified some centre practices and documentation that needed to be strengthened. These included extending risk-analysis management planning for excursions, clarifying medication authorisation and acknowledgement practices and extending procedures for how complaints will be responded to. Since the onsite stage of the review the centre has made improvements to these practices.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Elim Kiwikids Childcare Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>15 December 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
