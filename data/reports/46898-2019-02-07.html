</table><p>Minimee Playschool requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>New management has resulted in some positive changes. At this time a considerable amount of work is required to continue to raise the quality of practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Minimee Playschool is located in Newtown, Wellington. It was fully licensed in November 2017, with provision for 14 children, including five aged up to two years.</p><p>The centre is owned and governed by a private company and is situated within their office complex. All-day education and care is offered to the children of their employees. The board of directors provides assistance with risk management and health and safety matters, as well as financial support and oversight.</p><p>A part-time centre manager was appointed in 2017. She is a fully qualified teacher and divides her time between working with children, professional leadership and operational duties. She is supported by a head teacher. The teaching team includes fully qualified teachers, a provisionally certificated and an unqualified teacher.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for Minimee Playschool.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers' interactions with children are warm and responsive. A good range of cultural and community events and excursions, as well as cultural celebrations and experiences, extend the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They are supportive of parents and their role and regularly ask them about their aspirations for their children. Teachers share useful information, including centre experiences and appreciative observations of children with parents. They offer explanations of the valuable learning that is possible within play. Online portfolios support this communication. This process could be improved if teachers more consistently followed through on parent aspirations and children's identified interests in the assessment documentation. This should result in teachers adding more complex information and providing more challenging experiences to extend children's learning. A next step is for teachers to grow their understanding of the purpose and use of assessment for learning.</p><p>The daily programme incorporates aspects of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Making better and more consistent use of this, ensuring that children benefit from regularly hearing te reo MƒÅori in everyday conversations is a next step. Teachers are continually increasing their knowledge of the language to better support this.</p><p>Leadership is improvement focused. Some good strategies have been put in place to build teacher practice, including some professional learning opportunities to improve curriculum delivery. Key next steps for leaders and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>undertake professional learning focused on the revised early childhood curriculum <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and its implications for their practice</li>
<li>consult with families to develop a clear, shared understanding of what learning matters at Minimee Playschool to assist in identifying learning outcomes that will underpin the curriculum</li>
<li>ensure the learning that matters is supported through centre practices and evident in assessment and planning documentation</li>
<li>regularly review and evaluate practice to determine how well the learning that matters is achieved and where improvements are required.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to grow their understanding of current, intentional teaching practices. This should involve:</p><ul>
<li>improving curriculum delivery for infants, toddlers and young children by building teachers' knowledge and capability in planning, assessing and evaluating children's learning using the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> as a platform for improvement</li>
<li>building review and internal evaluation capability to support continuous improvement.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have identified that deepening their understanding of culturally responsive practices is a next step. ERO agrees that this should have benefits for children.</p><p>Teachers are developing their capacity to reflect on their practice. A next step is to build more consistent understandings and clear expectations for leaders and teachers to continually improve practice. Developing a more comprehensive appraisal policy, closely aligned to the Teaching Council expectations and revisiting the appraisal process is a priority. Leaders should ensure that professional learning and observations of practice clearly link to measurable goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key areas for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum development and delivery</li>
<li>staff appraisal</li>
<li>review and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Minimee Playschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. Leaders must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>equipment that could fall and cause injury or damage is secured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accident/incident records are analysed to identify hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service no longer offers a holiday programme for children enrolled at school in the licensed early learning service premises during licensed hours. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Services 2008, HS6, HS12; Section 310 Education Act 1989]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review management have taken steps to address these areas.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Minimee Playschool will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>7 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
