</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre, Botany is licensed for 135 children with a maximum of 25 up to two years of age. The centre is divided into age-related rooms. Each room has its own teaching team, routine, outdoor play area and age-appropriate resources. The site provides for a school holiday and before/after school programme.</p><p>The centre serves a culturally diverse community. Many children speak languages other than English. Most children are of Indian heritage with smaller numbers of children who are Asian, Pākehā, Māori or Pacific. The centre philosophy fosters an inclusive teaching approach within a nurturing environment. It promotes high quality education and a strong foundation for children's learning and development.</p><p>This is one of three Kiwi Supertots centres owned by the director and consultant. The regional manager is supported by an area manager and a centre supervisor. The centre employs 12 teachers, seven are fully registered and five are provisionally registered.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted that leaders provided good support for teachers to develop assessment, curriculum planning and evaluation. Self-review, parent partnership and the appraisal process were identified as improvement priorities. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is a welcoming place and supports children's sense of belonging. Children engage in a range of play experiences, and a programme that includes literacy, numeracy, science and projects where children's individual interests are extended. The environment is well resourced, attractive and encourages children's independent choice, curiosity and exploration.</p><p>Provision for children under two years of age, is guided by caring, nurturing teacher interactions with each child. Teachers document children's individual milestones, care routines and rituals. They are increasingly aware of implementing a curriculum that is based on their observations of children's development and play.</p><p>Parents have contributed to consultation processes and aspirations for their children. They appreciate the good quality care and learning their children receive. Leaders and teachers engage respectfully with parents and their community, and seek their contribution to children's learning. This contributes to a more responsive programme and meaningful setting for children, parents and the wider community.</p><p>A commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand, and the inclusiveness of multicultural values, guide the centre's direction and culture. Leaders promote equity and social justice for children and families. Children and parents have opportunities to share their cultural knowledge and home languages. Aspects of Māori and Pacific cultures are evident through the learning programmes and environment. Teachers are continuing to strengthen their knowledge of te ao Māori.</p><p>Managers work collaboratively with leaders and teachers to improve teaching practice through professional development. They have a strong commitment to continual improvement, and to their leadership responsibilities to contribute to positive outcomes for children and staff.</p><p>Teachers are open to learning. Very good processes are followed to guide and support teachers. There are clear links to <em>Te Whāriki</em> in the centre's curriculum planning. Teachers should continue to encourage child-led learning through an emergent curriculum. Planning and assessments could more clearly focus on enhancing children's dispositions and age appropriate emergent play.</p><p>There are good processes for children to transition into and across the different learning rooms of the centre. Leaders are keen to participate in a kāhui ako (community of learning) to further support their transition to the school programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation through deeper evaluative critique</li>
<li>engaging in professional development to improve learning outcomes for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>strengthening the emergent curriculum processes so that teachers can support children's interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre, Botany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre, Botany will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>1 March 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
