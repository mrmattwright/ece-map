<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Royal Oak is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Royal is a privately owned centre that offers education and care for children from two to five years of age. Professional development is provided for teachers through the Lollipops Franchise as well as through identifying teacher&rsquo;s needs and interest at regular team meetings.</p><p>Staff continue to build positive relationships with parents and families and to involve them in decisions about their children&rsquo;s learning and the centre direction. The centre has a history of good ERO reports.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders show a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is reflected in the environment, the programme and how children and adults interact. Adults want children to have fun as they learn and they review the programme regularly to see that this is happening.</p><p>Respectful relationships are evident amongst teachers, and between teachers, children and their families. Teachers are attentive to the children. They take time to listen and often make links with children&rsquo;s home backgrounds. They are involved in children&rsquo;s play and cater for children&rsquo;s interests by responding appropriately to extend children&rsquo;s choices.</p><p>The programme aligns to the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Leaders have appropriately identified the need to support teachers to provide a more bicultural curriculum. They are developing their understanding of Te Ao M&#257;ori perspectives and how these can be incorporated across all aspects of the curriculum. Teachers could consider how to promote more bicultural practices in the programme. They could further develop their teaching strategies to respond to the cultures, languages and identities of all children.</p><p>Children play cooperatively and support each other&rsquo;s suggestions and choices. There are good levels of conversations between children and some talk enthusiastically with teachers. Children initiate their own play freely in the calm and homely environment. They enjoy growing their garden. Teachers could now consider how best to encourage children to be more creative and to take lead roles in planning and designing their play.</p><p>The owner&rsquo;s commitment to positive outcomes for children is demonstrated in her approach to leading and managing the centre. The centre manager provides good guidance and support for the supervisor and teachers.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to evaluate the programme and plan how to respond to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Leaders have developed a process to share children&rsquo;s strengths and analyse that information to understand children&rsquo;s learning. Emergent leadership among teachers is encouraged and staff initiatives are valued and promoted. Teacher reflections and evaluations contribute to ongoing and planned self review and inform improvements.</p><p>Teachers relate very well to parents and families that attend. Parents are welcomed warmly and are encouraged to participate in activities. Meaningful and relevant support is provided for children transitioning into and out of the centre. Particular care is provided for families of children with special needs. ERO supports the centre&rsquo;s intention to strengthen its relationship with local primary schools.</p><p>The environment is well resourced with a good range of well-maintained resources and equipment. Recent developments have enhanced the learning environment. Parents&rsquo; suggestions about improvements to the outdoor area have been valued. Parents also have an opportunity to be involved in self review. Reviews are now being documented and outcomes are shared.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Royal Oak completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
