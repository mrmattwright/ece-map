The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p align="left">Kids 1<sup>st</sup> Childcare and Learning Centre in Waipu, offers full day care and education for children from two to four years of age. The centre operates in an airy, bright facility within a spacious playground. The centre&rsquo;s first ERO review in 2009 noted good quality practices which have been sustained and built upon.</p><p align="left">Children receive high quality programmes and are settled and happy. The programme is challenging and based on children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Teachers add extension ideas and topics they think will be of interest to children. The resulting programme provides opportunities for exploration and innovation. Children are respected as confident and capable learners.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively to provide consistency and clear expectations for children. They keep up to date with current research and early childhood education best practice. Teachers are respectful and positive in their relationships with children and families.</p><p align="left">Teachers are successfully promoting biculturalism as a teaching focus. They integrate te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme in meaningful ways to encourage children&rsquo;s understanding. Children respond and are able to use M&#257;ori phrases on occasions.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders have established good management systems for operating the centre. They use self review effectively to constantly improve the quality of management and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders identify, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for the centre are to continue to strengthen their self-review practices. This on-going process would promote continual improvement of programmes for children and of management practices and systems.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kids 1st Childcare was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKids 1st Childcare .</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
<li>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</li>
<li>the quality of management systems and practices</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the centre&rsquo;s first 2009 ERO review the teaching team has remained stable allowing teachers to improve their teaching practice over time. The earlier ERO report has been used well to focus both professional support and improvements to the environment and programme. Children attend for varying sessions during the week and some teachers work part-time. Children generally get to know teachers well and are confident and trusting. They play in a carefully planned environment that provides good opportunities for learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Teaching and learning. Children play well together, settle quickly and persevere with chosen tasks. They are friendly and caring with each other, play collaboratively, share their opinions and negotiate games. Children are keen to participate in the programme, confidently sharing ideas and news with teachers and their peers.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide good role modelling for children. They treat children with respect and warmth. Their conversations with children are empowering and positive. Teachers provide positive guidance that allows children to be successful. They know children and their families well. Teachers value children as competent learners, providing a programme includes a focus on current world and local events. Teachers adeptly challenge children&rsquo;s thinking.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. The centre is spacious and well resourced with good quality equipment and furnishings. Areas of play are well designed to encourage children&rsquo;s engagement and enjoyment. The outdoor area is interesting and provides children with physical challenge as well as opportunities for adventurous play.</p><p align="left">Assessment and planning. Teachers have established effective assessment and planning systems. Portfolios include learning and teaching stories, capturing snapshots of children&rsquo;s time in the centre. Teachers plan in response to what they know about children&rsquo;s interests. They also plan for broader topics of general interest. This blend of teacher and child initiatives ensures the programme has a broad scope.</p><p align="left">Bicultural partnership. Teachers have, over the last year, used new strategies and self review to strengthen the effectiveness of the centre&rsquo;s established bicultural focus. Parents are consulted, and new practices are developed. Regular whakatau meetings for families new to the centre, and opportunities to discuss children&rsquo;s progress and development have been successful. Teachers are implementing parents&rsquo; ideas for strengthening the bicultural aspects of the centre.</p><p align="left">Management practices. The management team have established sound management systems and practices. The team have used self-review practices as an effective tool to improve all aspects of the service. These practices include consultation and collaboration between families and teachers. The centre&rsquo;s policy framework guides operations and practice, including the appraisal system which is used to determine teachers&rsquo; professional development needs.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Centre managers appropriately identify that continued strengthening of their selfreview practices is a key next step for the centre. This continued development will support managers to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop appraisal systems</li>
<li>further promote recognition of children&rsquo;s cultures in the programme and centre environment</li>
<li>include children more regularly in planning their own learning</li>
<li>further strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>continue to encourage parent-input in decision-making processes.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kids 1st Childcare completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The centre operates in an airy, bright facility within a spacious playground. The centre&rsquo;s first ERO review in 2009 noted good quality practices which have been sustained and built upon.</p><p align="left">Children receive high quality programmes and are settled and happy. The programme is challenging and based on children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Teachers add extension ideas and topics they think will be of interest to children. The resulting programme provides opportunities for exploration and innovation. Children are respected as confident and capable learners.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively to provide consistency and clear expectations for children. They keep up to date with current research and early childhood education best practice. Teachers are respectful and positive in their relationships with children and families.</p><p align="left">Teachers are successfully promoting biculturalism as a teaching focus. They integrate te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme in meaningful ways to encourage children&rsquo;s understanding. Children respond and are able to use M&#257;ori phrases on occasions.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders have established good management systems for operating the centre. They use self review effectively to constantly improve the quality of management and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders identify, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for the centre are to continue to strengthen their self-review practices. This on-going process would promote continual improvement of programmes for children and of management practices and systems.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
