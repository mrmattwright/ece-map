</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Raumati Beach Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te¬†Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The September 2012 ERO report for Raumati Beach Kindergarten identified that self review needed further development. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report.</p><p>All teachers at Raumati Beach Kindergarten are qualified. The kindergarten is situated on the boundary of Raumati Beach School and this proximity supports the relationship between school and kindergarten.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Te Manawa is successfully implemented to promote positive outcomes for children. Children lead their involvement in learning, supported by teachers who respond well to their interests. The notion of ‚Äòplaying as a good friend‚Äô effectively underpins interactions and relationships. Children learn to share, negotiate and compromise. They collaborate, make choices and show independence.</p><p>The contributions of parents and whƒÅnau are valued. Teachers and families enjoy relaxed, supportive relationships. Families have a variety of opportunities to share their aspirations for their children and to find out about, and comment on learning.</p><p>Processes to assess and evaluate learning have improved since the previous ERO report and are responsive to the diverse needs of children. Teachers follow a clear process to recognise and record, in children‚Äôs profile books, significant learning. Progress with developing skills and dispositions is evident in some books. Continuing to strengthen these processes to capture and extend learning for children is a next step.</p><p>The good practice in supporting children to transition to school has been strengthened. Useful information about the child‚Äôs strengths and comments from both parents and children are provided to schools.</p><p>Self-review practices to support ongoing improvement and evaluate progress are continuing to develop. Using the established review process to more systematically review what is important in this kindergarten‚Äôs curriculum is a next step.</p><p>The head teacher and team work collaboratively to focus on improvements that impact positively for children. The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal process. This continues to require strengthening. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Children at Raumati Beach Kindergarten have regular opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New¬†Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. Association leaders acknowledge that they need to build teachers‚Äô capability to be responsive to MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Raumati Beach Kindergarten are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the assessment and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>self review and evaluation for continuing improvement</li>
<li>opportunities to promote bicultural practices throughout the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. These should include:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system</li>
<li>building teachers‚Äô capability to be responsive to MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Raumati Beach Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Raumati Beach Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.
