</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park is a located in the Rotorua suburb of Fairview at the base of Mount Ngongotaha. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years. At the time of the ERO review there were 37 children on the roll. Many of these children identify as M&#257;ori. They whakapapa to a variety of different tribes including Ng&#257;ti Whakaue, the local iwi. The service operates Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 2.30pm.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust provides robust policies and guidelines to support the operation of the kindergarten. It sets an overall strategic plan to guide kindergarten development. A professional leader, employed by the trust, supports practice in the kindergarten through regular visits. They work collaboratively with the Head Teacher to build leadership capacity, provide targeted support, coach and mentor teaching staff, ensure the trust policies and guidelines are followed and that the philosophy is enacted. The trust is currently reviewing teacher appraisal so that it encourages teachers to undertake inquiries which strengthen teaching.</p><p>Teachers understand children within the context of their whakapapa, wh&#257;nau and wider community. They are aware of the many intergenerational and extended family links amongst children and use this knowledge to inform their learning interactions with children. They implement a 'wrap around' approach to fostering children&rsquo;s emotional, intellectual, spiritual and physical wellbeing. This is particularly evident through the provision of access to a doctor and nurse who visit the kindergarten on a regular basis. Access to transport to and from the kindergarten helps remove barriers to regular attendance. Acceptance of diversity and a non-judgemental approach are highly evident.</p><p>The kindergarten is led by an experienced head teacher. After a period of staffing changes two new teachers have been recently employed. All staff are focussed on ensuring they are developing strong relationships with children and wh&#257;nau. The new teachers are being supported to align their practice with the values and philosophy of the kindergarten. All teachers are fully qualified early childhood educators.</p><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park has a positive reporting history with ERO. Managers have responded to the areas for review and development identified in the previous ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust cluster.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a rich range of opportunities to learn and extend their thinking through play. Literacy, mathematics, science and higher order thinking skills are well integrated into this play through teachers&rsquo; interactions and discussions with children. There are also many opportunities for them to develop their communication and social skills. Children display many attributes for life-long learning such as:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-management skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tuakana/teina relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are knowledgeable and have a good understanding of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The principles of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> and the concepts of manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are strongly evident. Teachers support children to develop dispositions for learning such as curiosity and resilience. They trust children to be capable and to take informed risks. There is a well-resourced and well-prepared environment for learning. A number of natural, bush-like spaces in the outdoor area, as well as small group excursions into the community visiting significant local areas such as Te Puia Geysers, promote children&rsquo;s understanding of themselves as kaitiaki.</p><p>Strong, positive relationships between teachers and children underpin all interactions.</p><p>Effective teaching strategies observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>supporting children to become independent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asking open-ended questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revisiting prior learning to add complexity and extend the learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving children time and space for sustained play and exploration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Parents that spoke to ERO expressed a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten and appreciated its homely, family-like environment. There are many opportunities for them to be involved and take a lead in daily kindergarten life. Teachers place priority on building trusting relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau. This promotes open communication and the sharing of ideas and aspirations for children&rsquo;s learning. Strong relationships with outside agencies provide support for children and wh&#257;nau and help to remove barriers to learning. The head teacher is a strong advocate for children and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is well documented in learning profile books. Children take great pride in these profiles. They are well used as a tool for developing early literacy skills and for reporting to parents on children&rsquo;s progress and development.</p><p>The head teacher shows a commitment to the kindergarten philosophy, which is well enacted. She promotes a culture of reflection and review. Leadership is collaborative and shared.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the kindergarten agree that useful next steps that would improve outcomes for children are continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the way the kindergarten evaluates and documents the impacts of self-review on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the ways that children&rsquo;s progress over time is demonstrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen a local, place-based curriculum that supports and enhances children&rsquo;s identity as M&#257;ori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have&nbsp;taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices/PART-4-ERO-s-Framework-for-review-Nga-Pou-Here"> Ng&#257; Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.&nbsp;</p></html>
