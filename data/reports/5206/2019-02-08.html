</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park is situated in the Western Heights suburb of Rotorua. It is licensed for 40 children. The current roll of 33 children includes 25 of whom identify as Māori. Since the 2015 ERO review there has been a change in the operational model for this kindergarten. It now remains open during the school term breaks throughout the year, offering hours between 8am to 3.30pm, for children aged from two years to school age.  </p><p>The kindergarten operates under the governance and management of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, a community not-for-profit organisation. The overarching philosophy of the organisation is to provide kindergartens where children learn through play and are supported to reach their potential.</p><p>Through their kindergarten philosophy teachers' aim to provide an environment and resources to support learning through play. They encourage problem solving, goal setting and establishing strong relationships with children and whānau. Teachers aim to provide a safe, warm and nurturing learning environment that provide equitable opportunities for children to play and explore.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. It has responded well to strengthening self-review and developing a local place-based curriculum enhancing Māori children's identity. Assessment showing progress of learning over time remains an area to focus on.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust organisation.  </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A broad and rich curriculum is promoting positive outcomes for children. Children learn through play in a well-resourced environment. Educational visitors enrich the programme. Maths, literacy and science are naturally integrated. There is a strong focus on Enviroschools, with a silver award recently achieved. Māori children are supported to achieve success. Whole community projects such as whānau-led artworks depicting te ao Māori, and te reo Māori community classes, support Māori children and their whānau to learn together. Children and their whānau develop skills for lifelong learning.</p><p>Children benefit from strong and affirming relationships. Teachers are highly responsive to children with additional learning needs. They work alongside external agencies for children who require this support. Children's oral language and social competence are well supported with teachers accessing relevant professional development and inquiring into their professional practice. Routines are unhurried and children can readily access the spacious and attractive outdoor area. Children develop a sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Children's learning is presented in informative wall displays and individual portfolio books which are made available online for parents and whānau. Indoor wall displays show parents and children what learning is happening, celebrates children's work and captures whānau engagement. Some group interests are planned for. Teachers should consider ways to intentionally plan learning pathways for all individual children, considering whānau voice and aspirations. </p><p>The experienced head teacher maintains a culture of learning and is a strong advocate for children and their whānau. There is an ongoing focus on equity for all learners and support for whole families. Strong connections with the wider local community and a wide range of initiatives to effectively remove barriers to education have been established. Each child is celebrated for who they are and what they bring to the kindergarten through inclusive teaching practices.</p><p>Children’s learning is at the forefront of decision making. A strengthened process for internal evaluation is leading to positive changes in practice. The head teacher and team are supported by a Kaiarataki from the trust. Leaders are growing the capacity of teachers through appraisal, inquiries and internal evaluation. This is leading to improved outcomes for children's learning.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement for its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and Trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children’s learning, wellbeing and that of their whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park are to:</p><ul>
<li>explore ways to seek whānau aspirations</li>
<li>effectively document how intentional teaching and planning is supporting individual children to develop complexity of learning over time</li>
<li>consider how to strengthen the use of te reo Māori to support all learners.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice Central North Island Kindergarten Trust management needs to ensure observations of teacher practice are undertaken as part of the appraisal process.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Fairview Park will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie<br> Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Central Region</p><p>8 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
