</table><p>Sydenham Community Preschool is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sydenham Community Preschool is a not-for-profit, parent-governed, early childhood education and care service. Most staff are registered teachers and have been employed by the preschool for a number of years. They provide education and care for children from birth to school age.</p><p>The purpose-built preschool is situated within the grounds of Waltham Primary School. Leaders and teachers are part of a learning cluster of early childhood centres and schools that are focused on supporting the education and wellbeing of all children within their increasingly diverse community.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made good progress with the recommendations from the 2013 ERO report, such as developing management processes and strengthening authentic learning partnerships with parents. This includes a strong focus on developing understandings of the Samoan language and culture. Leaders and teachers have established purposeful professional links with the wider early childhood education sector, including some Pacific centres.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are responsive to the needs of the community and have purposeful links to specialist agencies and services to help support families in a range of ways.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The preschool philosophy is strongly reflected in centre practices. Leaders and teachers actively foster positive relationships with children, parents and whƒÅnau. They have created a very respectful, well considered, and inclusive learning environment for families and for staff.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are open to 'listening to culture', allowing space and time for children and families to tell their stories and to develop a strong sense of belonging as they transition into the centre and between areas.</p><p>Teachers have effectively implemented a child-led curriculum that values parent and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children's learning and wellbeing. They are sensitive to the diverse needs and cultures of families. Children and families are at the heart of all decision making and responsive teaching practices.</p><p>Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted time so they can follow their interests, explore and investigate their discoveries. They enjoy many opportunities to be involved in a wide range of creative experiences, and physical challenges. Teachers model care and respect for one another and for children. They encourage children to take responsibility for each other and the natural world.</p><p>Teachers effectively use MƒÅori and Pacific symbols and natural resources to contribute to the vibrant learning areas and to weave a meaningful curriculum. They are skilled storytellers, capturing children's imagination and involving them in rich oral language experiences, particularly about te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for in a warm, homely environment. Secure relationships with familiar teachers promote the development of children's positive sense of self. Teachers are responsive to the individual needs and preferences of children. They involve children in predictable, personalised routines that link closely to home routines. Teachers place a strong focus on respect within all aspects of the curriculum that they provide for young children.</p><p>The parent committee, leaders and teachers have a strong team culture and shared vision and philosophy. They are very reflective and improvement focused. They value and make good use of individual strengths, experiences and skills to support the effective operation of the service and to promote positive outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Leaders are increasingly aligning management processes such as strategic planning, self review, and appraisal. A key feature of the success of this service is the commitment to extensive, shared and to promote targeted professional development that builds the capability of teachers and leaders. This is helping to promote culturally responsive practices that respond to community needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to refine and embed more useful planning and evaluation to better reflect and maximise the good practices that are occurring.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sydenham Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sydenham Community Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>21 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
