</table><p>The service needs support to improve the quality of teaching, the provision for children and governance and management systems.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Our Place home-based education and care service is privately owned and operates from Dannevirke in the Tararua district.</p><p>Day-to-day organisation and oversight are shared by the manager and one coordinator. The coordinator oversees the teaching and learning programmes and environments provided for children in educators' homes.</p><p>The service is licensed for 80 children up to five years of age, for six days a week. At the time of this review 29 children are enrolled. Of these, 6 children identify as MƒÅori and two are of Pacific heritage. The in-home educators include MƒÅori and Pacific people.</p><p>The service's philosophy expects that children will learn, develop, experience and aspire in a nurturing, supportive environment that recognises their culture, individuality and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO's August 2015 report identified that ongoing evaluation to strengthen systems and processes to clearly articulate the extent to which the service provides high quality education and care for children through appraisal: strengthened relationships; educators' capability of assessment, planning and evaluation and their understanding of expectations for maintaining high quality standards of education and care required further development. These continue to be work in progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a range of learning experiences in educators‚Äô homes and in the local community. They join in playgroup sessions, organised trips and local community events. These excursions provide ongoing learning, new challenges and opportunities to socialise. Children also engage in programmes that can include literacy, mathematics, the arts, te ao MƒÅori and physical play. There is inconsistency in the quality of the teaching and learning experiences.</p><p><em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, guides educators in their understanding about assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. The quality of the assessment is highly variable. Learning narratives should be informed by individual children's strengths, interests and preferences, include learning outcomes, children's progress over time, and next learning steps. Management identifies that building their capability and the educator monitoring systems to ensure consistency is a next step. ERO's external evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>There is a focus on age appropriate environments and resources in home settings. Child placement practices are well considered.</p><p>A service focus has been to strengthen relationships between educators, families and whƒÅnau. Communication with parents about children's wellbeing and progress is shared regularly facetoface, in photographs and profiles. An introduced online platform in the initial stages of development is providing further opportunities for parent and whƒÅnau contribution.</p><p>Professional development is supporting the service to improve learning outcomes for children. Professional learning is designed to focus more on the coordinator and educators building curriculum knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Home visits by the coordinator are mandatory to ensure that health and safety requirements are met and children's learning experiences are suitable. The coordinator role supports educators to facilitate infants' and toddlers' learning and development through ongoing discussions. A next step is for the coordinator to document feedback that informs and guides educators' development as facilitators of learning.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori knowledge and understanding is valued. MƒÅori input within the service and community has supported managers and educators to build their Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based practice. MƒÅori children are involved in experiences connected to culture, language and identity.</p><p>The service has a considered transition approach which includes educator assistance for children, parents and families.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are welcomed. The service is aware of community support and resources to assist participation of these children in learning programmes.</p><p>The newly implemented appraisal process for the manager and coordinator is in progress. A next step is to provide a formalised mentoring programme for educators that is responsive to their individual needs to raise the quality of teaching and improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Management needs to further develop evaluation for accountability and improvement. Management has implemented some planned reviews which have resulted in positive changes for children. Professional development in internal evaluation should continue to develop leaders' knowledge of what works and what needs to change for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management should:</p><ul>
<li>improve educator understanding and implementation of high quality practices for assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>build shared knowledge and understanding of review and evaluation</li>
<li>develop a formalised mentoring programme for educators responsive to their individual needs to better support learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>implement robust appraisal</li>
<li>implement effective review practice to ensure legislative systems and processes are met</li>
<li>refine, implement and monitor clearly defined expectations for service operations, with a particular emphasis on improving leaders' and educators' practice over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Our Place completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety and governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>implement regular review and evaluation to improve practice</li>
<li>formalise a mentoring programme for educators responsive to their individual needs to better support learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>ensure all educators have a current First Aid certificate. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, GMA 5, GMA6, HS22]</em></li>
</ul><p><em><span>Following the onsite phase the First Aid certificate requirement has now been met.</span></em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Our Place will be within two years</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>26 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
