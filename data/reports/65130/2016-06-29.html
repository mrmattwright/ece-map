</table><p>Busy Bees is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Busy Bees is a small, privately-owned centre located in a renovated villa. The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children up to school age in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>A number of staff have worked at the centre for long periods of time, including the new co-owner who has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre. All full-time staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy places importance on establishing strong links between home and the centre, maintaining positive, nurturing relationships and providing a home-like environment. Many aspects of the philosophy are evident in the learning programme and centre practices.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, bicultural practices have been strengthened. The centre has a number of developments taking place in this area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have respectful, caring relationships with each other and their teachers. They are confident and settled in the learning programme and work positively together. Children have many opportunities to follow their interests from the range of resources and activities set out.</p><p>Teachers work closely with children at their level and pace. They are well aware of each child's needs, interests and development. Teachers arrange the environment to encourage children to explore the various spaces. They plan events and outings into the community to enrich children's learning.</p><p>Under two-year-old children are nurtured and well supported in the learning programme by adults who are familiar to them. They have many opportunities to learn and play with their siblings and other children. Teachers value the skills and knowledge of these young children and provide appropriate challenges to extend their interests and learning.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming, inclusive environment for children and families. They create a family-like environment and foster a strong sense of belonging for children and families. Parents contribute to the centre by being involved in parent evenings and centre events. Teachers ask parents about what they want for their children and consult them about centre policies and practices.</p><p>Teachers have had a strong focus on strengthening assessment and planning practices.</p><p>Teachers could further support children by making the intended learning clearer and teaching strategies more specific in group planning. They also need to more clearly evaluate children's learning and the impacts of teaching.</p><p>Transition into the centre is well planned and responsive to the needs of each child and family. Recently, teachers have focused on strengthening the transition to school processes. They have provided helpful information for parents explaining how the learning programme develops children's skills and confidence to successfully transition to school.</p><p>The centre owners provide effective support for teachers. They value and make good use of professional development opportunities. They effectively use teacher strengths to enrich the learning programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work well together and give each other helpful feedback. Leaders effectively use the appraisal process to encourage teachers to think about and improve their teaching.</p><p>The owners are strongly focused on ongoing improvement. Centre leaders and teachers regularly use a process of self review to look at their practice and make positive changes. This process would be strengthened by deciding on clear indicators and taking a more evaluative approach.</p><p>The owners have created a set of worthwhile goals to guide centre development. In the future, it would be appropriate to streamline the centre's strategic vision and plan to more clearly link this to other key centre documents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and centre leaders agree that the next key steps for improving outcomes for children are for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>review the centre philosophy to state more clearly the important learning for children</li>
<li>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation processes to clearly show children's next steps for learning and progress over time</li>
<li>better show how they respond to parents' wishes for children's learning</li>
<li>consolidate and embed a more evaluative approach to self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Busy Bees will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>29 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
