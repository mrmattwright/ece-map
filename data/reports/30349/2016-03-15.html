</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Einsteins Educare Pukeko is a privately owned centre situated on the northern outskirts of Cambridge and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. Ruma Pukeko is one of the three licences on the same extensive site and caters for children from approximately 3¬Ω years to school age. It is licenced for a maximum of 40 children over two. At the time of this ERO review, there were 45 children enrolled, of whom 3 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The service provider is responsible for governance and centre management. She has recently completed her registration as a qualified early childhood educator. Each of the three licences, including Ruma Pukeko, has a team leader responsible for teaching and learning in their area. In addition, the team leaders form a management team with the service provider to ensure continuity and consistency of planning and practices across the centre. Since the previous ERO review in 2013, there have been several changes of teaching staff in Ruma Pukeko.</p><p>The centre as a whole, and each individual room, are working very successfully to fulfil the key elements of Little Einsteins Educare philosophy. This is to maintain high quality relationships, provide a stimulating learning environment, reflect the principle of partnership in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and deliver appropriate learning programmes for children. The programme incorporates <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and is informed by appropriate theorists.</p><p>Little Einsteins Educare Pukeko has a positive reporting history with ERO and effectively responded to the agreed area for development related to increased use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children develop a strong sense of belonging promoted by caring and respectful relationships with adults and peers. Centre and team leaders have established a culture in which children are, first and foremost, valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. High quality teaching practice and routines support the development of children‚Äôs social competence and self management. Teachers are highly responsive to children‚Äôs physical and emotional needs.</p><p>Children are empowered to initiate their own learning and they benefit from extended periods of uninterrupted time for exploration and play. They have access to generous amounts of space and a wide range of high quality equipment, including opportunities for physical challenge and construction. Children‚Äôs experiences of the natural world include ongoing interactions with animals and assisting with edible gardens. Literacy and mathematics are effectively integrated across the programme.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the additional learning experiences for children, provided by visits, excursions and involvement in community activities. These have included contributing to community charities, an excursion to Whakarewarewa and reciprocal visits with a retirement home. Children in Ruma Pukeko also enjoy weekly French lessons.</p><p>Bicultural and inclusive practices are highly evident in the centre. The owner has funded the provision of a te reo and tikanga MƒÅori tutor who has worked with teachers and children to build their confidence and competence. Teachers also research other languages and cultures to help their understanding and support of children and families whose first language is not English.</p><p>Teachers know children well and plan collaboratively to respond to identified individual and group interests, strengths and needs. There are highly effective assessment processes to share children‚Äôs learning and development with their families through regular informal conversations, individual portfolios and the increasing use of digital technologies. These processes are promoting parent and child contributions to learning stories and aspects of the programme. The team continues to research and implement the extended use of digital technologies to enhance teaching and learning.</p><p>Transitions into and from Ruma Pukeko are well considered and highly supportive of children and their families. The centre maintains strong links with local schools, ensures parents are well informed, and children are prepared and confident about starting school. Each child receives a personalised school book to record their familiarisation with their chosen school.</p><p>High levels of relational trust are evident amongst all staff at the centre. This is apparent in the collegial approach to professional development and appraisal. Teachers have opportunities to take responsibility for aspects of learning and areas of practice. Self-review processes are well established, inform decision making and are focused on improving outcomes for children. These processes could now be extended to include the planned review of broader curriculum areas. Centre leaders recognise that other areas for review are:</p><ul>
<li>targeted professional development for the management team</li>
<li>the increased use of the natural environment to support children‚Äôs learning and development.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders work successfully to build and maintain constructive networks with parents and the wider local community. A range of effective communication strategies are used to ensure families are well informed and able to contribute to decisions that affect their child. Parents and families are acknowledged and welcomed when they enter the centre and enjoy attending a number of centre events.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Einsteins Educare Pukeko completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Einsteins Educare Pukeko will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>15 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
