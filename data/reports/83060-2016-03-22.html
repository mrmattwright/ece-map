</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The service provider is not adequately exercising its responsibilities. The service needs support to develop aspects of governance and management. This includes monitoring the effective operation of the centre, keeping up with current requirements, developing an effective appraisal system and implementing self review.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Les Mills (Dn) Early Childhood Centre, known as Kids World, is part of the Les Mills gym in central Dunedin. It provides education and care for up to 25 children from infants to school age.</span></p><p>The centre is open to the children of gym members. It provides two or three sessions a day. Each session runs for one and a half hours. Most children come to the centre while their parents attend the gym.</p><p>The centre operates from a spacious upstairs room. Teachers set up and pack away the centre resources daily. There is no outdoor area.</p><p>Children at the centre benefit from a high teacher-to-child ratio. One of the four teachers is the centre manager. The teachers are long serving and all are qualified. Les Mills Dunedin is the service provider and is represented by the Les Mills Dunedin Manager.</p><p>A number of the recommendations in the 2012 ERO report have not yet been adequately addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm and trusting relationships with their teachers. The teachers show genuine pleasure in greeting and working with the children. The caring culture of the centre helps the children to settle quickly.</p><p>The teachers have a calm approach with children, particularly with infants and toddlers. Their needs are continuously attended to through the teaching team‚Äôs vigilance and communication. Teachers respect children‚Äôs individual preferences about who to relate to.</p><p>Children show a sense of security and belonging at the centre. They are empowered to make decisions and develop skills for interacting with others. Teachers are mindful of the need to give children time to respond to new opportunities for learning and to their individual needs and care. Children are familiar with the centre routines. Teachers talk with parents about their children at the start and end of the sessions.</p><p>The teachers give children the time and space to explore and solve problems for themselves. They provide appropriate resources and equipment to allow infants and toddlers opportunity to explore and to make choices in their activities. This includes a range of activities such as riding bikes, messy play and climbing.</p><p>Teachers use te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the course of the day. They are developing ways to strengthen these aspects of the centre programme.</p><p>Group plans based around interesting activities provide direction for the programme. The teachers develop useful individual plans where there is a particular need to support children‚Äôs wellbeing. It would be beneficial for teachers to focus group plans more closely on learning for children. This will help them to build up a more meaningful body of evidence around the learning that is being planned for.</p><p>Learning stories are an attractive record of children‚Äôs experiences at the centre. They are communicated to parents by email and wall displays. The stories often include an analysis of the learning going on, but do not usually show children‚Äôs ongoing progress.</p><p>The centre manager has fostered an environment in which teachers, children and parents communicate well together. The teaching team has shared understandings about how to work with children. Teachers are thoughtful and reflective. They try different ways of doing things to make learning enjoyable. Their documented reviews have led to useful changes at the centre.</p><p>The centre manager has some contact with other early childhood centres and has identified it would be useful to strengthen these links. The Les Mills Dunedin manager has noted he could initiate renewed collaboration between Les Mills early childhood education services. ERO agrees that this would be valuable for the centre.</p><p>The centre does not have reporting systems in place to give the service provider useful information about the effective operation of the centre. The Les Mills Dunedin Manager and Centre Manager are not well enough informed about the current requirements for running an early childhood service. They need to:</p><ul>
<li>consult with the centre's community to identify priorities for the centre's future development</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of effective self review that allows them and the teachers to improve the quality of care and education in a systematic way.</li>
</ul><p>Some personnel practices are inadequate. An appraisal system was implemented after the 2012 ERO review but it was not maintained. More formalised support should be provided for provisionally registered teachers. The managers need to develop a professional development plan. This would better support teachers‚Äô and the centre manager's professional development goals as well as centre-wide priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers should:</p><ul>
<li>develop a strategic plan that identifies priorities for the future development of the centre</li>
<li>monitor the plan closely to ensure that the planned developments are sustained</li>
<li>establish ways to keep themselves informed about current requirements, including the provisions of the Vulnerable Children Act</li>
<li>develop a professional development plan to support teachers‚Äô individual goals and centre-wide priorities, and to support the centre manager in her role</li>
<li>strengthen connections with other early childhood services.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen aspects of te ao MƒÅori in the programme</li>
<li>focus their group plans on learning for children</li>
<li>more clearly show continuity of learning in the children‚Äôs learning records.</li>
</ul><p>The service provider should access external professional support to address the steps above.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Les Mills (Dn) Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the service provider should ensure the centre and gym emergency evacuation plans are consistent, and review the centre plan annually. They should also:</p><ul>
<li>keep a detailed record of food provided at the centre</li>
<li>carry out and document safety checks daily.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found areas of non-compliance relating to personnel practices and self review. To meet requirements, the service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>there is an effective appraisal system for teachers and the centre manager, including appraisal against the 12 Practising Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>appropriate support is in place for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>managers and teachers implement effective self review, including a schedule of planned review to cover over time all important matters that impact on children.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consults with the Ministry of Education and plans to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Les Mills (Dn) Early Childhood Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>22 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
