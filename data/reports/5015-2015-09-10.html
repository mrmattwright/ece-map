</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hikurangi Kindergarten is situated in a semi-rural township north of Whangarei. The kindergarten provides education and care for 30 children over two years of age in a mixed age group. The kindergarten caters for a high percentage of children who have MƒÅori heritage. Children are able to attend sessions from 8:45am to 2:45pm five days a week.</p><p>The kindergarten has recently been through a significant change in staffing. An existing teacher was promoted to the head teacher position early in 2015, and a new teacher was appointed during the second term. This very new team is in the process of establishing cohesive and consistent approaches to their teaching practice, including a shared vision and philosophy for the kindergarten.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified some good teaching practices. It also outlined a number of areas of teaching practice that needed review and improvement. These areas included sharing expectations for professional work, improving self review as a reflective tool, and procedural practices that had been neglected. The new team are aware of the expectations about maintaining good practice.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides governance, leadership and policy frameworks to meet operational management expectations. Association personnel assist teachers to maintain good standards of health and safety and to improve the quality of educational programmes. The Association‚Äôs <em>P≈´manawatanga</em> Plan reflects a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and support for the development of bicultural practices across the organisation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new teaching team in the kindergarten is working diligently to establish sound, collegial working relationships. Many systems and practices are being established or revived as the team works together to improve learning outcomes for children. Teachers‚Äô enthusiasm for, and commitment to these tasks is evident. The newly revised philosophy and vision statements have been good starting points for identifying key priorities for future developments.</p><p>Teachers place a strong focus on settling children and their whƒÅnau. They have friendly and open relationships with whƒÅnau that recognise the importance of collaboration about children‚Äôs early education. These partnerships contribute positively to children‚Äôs participation and enjoyment of the programme.</p><p>There is a warm and inviting wairua and settled atmosphere in the kindergarten. Children participate in a wide range of activities and experiences. Teachers‚Äô recent focus on improving the range of available resources and arrangement of the kindergarten environment is having a positive effect. Children are engaged and take pleasure in their self chosen play. In particular, work on enlivening the outdoor provisions for play and learning about sustainability is providing children with good opportunities to extend their play.</p><p>Children hear te reo MƒÅori modelled often by teachers and are also beginning to use te reo MƒÅori as they play. These beginning steps are strengthening children‚Äôs knowledge and familiarity with te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and are being well supported by the Pou Whakarewa Tikanga MƒÅori from the Association.</p><p>Children and teachers are respectful and friendly. Teachers share conversations and children have opportunities to listen to stories and to sing together. Teachers now need to place a stronger focus on developing strategies to increase support for children‚Äôs oral language development.</p><p>Teachers have made a good start to establishing effective assessment and planning systems. They have identified goals for increasing the quality of the information they collect about children‚Äôs learning. They use this information as starting points for planning. Teachers intend to make responses to whƒÅnau aspirations more apparent in portfolio entries and to seek whƒÅnau input on a more regular basis.</p><p>WhƒÅnau expressed their pleasure with the new innovations in the programmes provided for their children. They value the kindergarten and teachers‚Äô welcoming approaches. They believe that communication and face to face conversations with teachers are becoming strengths of the kindergarten.</p><p>The Northland Kindergarten Association provides effective governance for kindergartens. Its long term direction focuses on making decisions to improve learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>good support and guidance from Association personnel to improve the quality of kindergarten programmes and teaching practice, particularly the development of bicultural practices and integration of <em>Te Ao MƒÅori</em> (the MƒÅori world) into programmes in meaningful ways for children</li>
<li>effective teacher appraisal and professional learning and development that contributes to improved teacher skills, knowledge and practice, especially in supporting children‚Äôs social competence and strengthening the quality of assessment documentation</li>
<li>significant investment in property and environment upgrades to promote children‚Äôs exploration and investigation</li>
<li>a focus on distributed leadership practices amongst kindergarten teaching teams to utilise teachers‚Äô individual and collective strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Association leaders are considering ways to enhance teacher appraisal processes and systems for self review. ERO recommends that the Association strengthens systems to ensure that all health and safety requirements are being implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are managing the pace of change effectively so that they are able to maintain a clear focus on next steps to improve positive outcomes for children. Teachers should use established self review processes to:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in meeting philosophy aspirations</li>
<li>further strengthen strategies for positive guidance to support children‚Äôs growing independence and competence</li>
<li>strengthen confidence in using information and communication technologies (ICT) in meaningful ways as part of the programme</li>
<li>increasing the focus on extending children‚Äôs oral language in planning</li>
<li>revisiting directional and annual plans, the philosophy and vision statement in 2016 to determine whether these documents are aligned with the team‚Äôs intentions for the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hikurangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hikurangi Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
