<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Elstree Kindergarten is developing its capacity to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Elstree Kindergarten, Rotorua, provides education and care for 46 children, including 18 children identified as Māori. It operates under the umbrella organisation of the Central North Island Kindergarten Association (CNIKA) which provides support for governance, administration and personnel management. The kindergarten’s philosophy aims to provide a programme based on <em>Te Wh</em>ā<em>riki, New Zealand’s Early Childhood Curriculum</em>, that reflects the aspirations of parents and whānau.</p>
<p>Since the ERO report in November 2009 the head teacher has made some progress in responding to the recommendation about further developing her leadership. Teachers have benefited from recent, relevant and ongoing professional development. A professional leader was appointed by the association in 2010, and works in a positive partnership with teachers.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in twelve early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Governance and management is supportive, the curriculum responds to children’s strengths and interests and teachers have established positive relationships with children and their families. Governance and management systems that contribute to the overall operation of this kindergarten include:</p>
<ul><li>strategic direction and policy guidelines that provide a consistent framework for expectations and development for the kindergarten</li>
<li>the provision of ongoing, relevant and high quality professional development</li>
<li>provision of administrative personnel</li>
<li>the knowledgeable professional leader who provides guidance to strengthen the quality of education and leadership in the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p>The long-serving head teacher provides stable and shared leadership for the kindergarten. She demonstrates a strong commitment to the kindergarten philosophy and maintains positive partnerships with families. The head teacher supports teachers to reflect on their practice, share professional learning and participate in professional development.</p>
<p>Elstree Kindergarten’s curriculum design and programme recognise and respond to children’s identified strengths, interests and learning dispositions. Teachers make good use of the local and wider community for trips and to extend children’s learning. Children are developing their social skills and competencies. They experience success in their learning through making decisions, exploring and investigating alongside their friends and teachers. Teachers know children and their families well and respond to children’s interests over time. Children are developing their early concepts of literacy and mathematics. There is an emphasis on learning about recycling and the natural world.</p>
<p>Families demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten. They contribute to the programme by sharing their knowledge with children and providing additional learning opportunities.</p>
<p>ERO observed examples of teaching practices that foster children’s confidence as capable learners.</p>
<p>Teachers have meaningful conversations that encourage children’s thinking skills, and support and extend their learning and development. They demonstrate respect for children’s questions and developing curiosity. Recent professional development has led to improvements in the individual profile books that record children’s learning experiences and development. Children make good use of these books to revisit and share learning with their parents and family, and with teachers when transitioning to school.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>ERO, the professional leader from the association, and teachers agree that important next steps for ongoing improvement and development include:</p>
<ul><li>the head teacher implementing a planned and systematic approach to effective self-review practices</li>
<li>teachers taking a more a planned approach to responding to and extending children’s interests through a prepared environment and intentional teaching strategies</li>
<li>ensuring children’s home languages and cultural practices are heard and seen in the environment</li>
<li>ensuring teachers are confident and competent in the meaningful integration of te reo and tikanga Māori practices into the programme, environment and annual plans.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and kindergarten leadership agree there is a need for teachers to undertake ongoing professional development in self review and teaching practices that promote positive outcomes for all children.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elstree Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>ERO identified the following area of non-compliance. Some equipment and furnishings were not well maintained or hygienic. To address this kindergarten leadership must:</p>
<ol><li>Ensure that premises, furniture, furnishings, fittings, equipment and materials are kept hygienic and maintained in good condition. <em>[Education (Early Childhood) Regulations 2008 R46,8,(HS1)]</em></li>
</ol><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
