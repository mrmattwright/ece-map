</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Elstree operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The kindergarten is located in central Rotorua, and is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review, 38 children were attending, including a high number of two year olds and 15 who are identified as Māori. To meet the needs of its community, the kindergarten is licensed to open from 8.00 am to 3.30 pm for five days a week, and remains open during term holidays.</p>
<p>There has been a recent change in leadership after a long-serving head teacher left, and an experienced teacher moved to another kindergarten. The playground has been improved, and the teaching team have developed an agreed set of values and beliefs about early childhood education. There has been a substantial increase in the roll during the year.</p>
<p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. The 2012 ERO review identified a need to strengthen self-review practices and take a planned approach to extending children’s interests. Reviews of curriculum areas are enabling teachers to identify gaps in their teaching practice and introduce improvements. Bicultural aspects of the programme are now more evident, and a variety of other cultures are now represented in the environment. The teachers, children and parents, supported by the trust's professional leaders, welcomed the ERO review team to the kindergarten with a whakatau that modelled tikanga Māori protocols.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust’s strategic direction sets out the service’s vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whārik</em>i, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust works positively to provide equitable opportunities to families by extending its hours of opening.</p>
<p>Professional leaders monitor the kindergarten’s compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. They work alongside head teachers to support and provide guidance, and to mentor teachers as part of the appraisal process. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p>
<p>The trust has undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal in consultation with teachers. This is enabling them to respond to the expectations of the Education Council and increase the depth of teachers’ reflections about their practice. The trust has also responded effectively to the Vulnerable Children’s Act, and is well-placed to complete required changes to policies and practices for the protection of children.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are highly involved in play and learning. They independently explore their areas of interest choosing from a wide range of learning activities and experiences. Children are developing positive social and emotional skills. They are confident with adults, and approach them to share ideas and successes, or to ask for help when needed. Older children develop tuakana-teina relationships and relate thoughtfully with younger children, supporting their confidence and participation in play.</p>
<p>Children have free access to equipment and resources, so can develop their play to sustain and extend their interest, and challenge their skills and understandings. They play actively in the outdoor area, developing their physical strengths and sense of balance. Children enjoy planting, growing and harvesting fruit and vegetables. These experiences, together with their sensory exploration of mud, sand and water support their understanding and care of the physical and natural world.</p>
<p>Early aspects of literacy are naturally included in the daily programme. Children are interested in sharing books and also use them alongside teachers to research information. They make extensive use of creative materials and are developing their ability to express their ideas in drawings and paintings. Numeracy experiences are evident through puzzles, counting and measuring.</p>
<p>Teachers have positive, responsive and authentic relationships with children. They know children well and work at their level to support interests and extend learning. Teachers use consistent, well-designed interventions to give positive guidance that builds social skills and enables children to solve problems.</p>
<p>The attractive indoor and outdoor environments are set up to stimulate and inspire children’s curiosity. Centre routines are flexible so they do not interrupt children’s discoveries, and teachers do not intervene when they are assured that children can manage their play safely.</p>
<p>The curriculum reflects <em>Te Whāriki</em> and includes aspects of Māori culture in meaningful ways. Teachers are developing their knowledge of te reo, tikanga and Māori ways of learning to strengthen the identity of Māori learners, and have developed a strong partnership with parents. They acknowledge parents’ aspirations for their children and keep parents informed about their children’s progress through everyday conversations and individual portfolios. Parents can choose to receive learning stories through an on-line programme that allows them to give prompt feedback about their child's learning and progress.</p>
<p>Teachers use these records to identify children’s interests and plan future learning opportunities. They are beginning to keep track of individual children’s learning pathways and record their learning according to <em>Te Whāriki</em> strands.</p>
<p>Transitions into and out of the kindergarten are well managed. Parents are welcome to spend time in the kindergarten and contribute to the programme. Teachers are undertaking an in-depth self review about enhancing children’s confidence as they transition to school. This is identifying ways that the kindergarten can provide relevant support and information to ease the transition process.</p>
<p>The head teacher’s strong, positive leadership has developed a collaborative team culture and consistent practice. Teachers have a strong commitment to ongoing professional development. They share ideas and information freely, take on delegated responsibilities, and are committed to continuing growth and improvement. The head teacher is supported by a well-informed professional leader who offers experienced and positive guidance and support.</p>
<p>The head teacher has positive and respectful relationships with whānau. She is committed to enhancing contacts with local iwi and kaumātua, and to developing a fund of knowledge about the local environment, its history and local legends. She contributes her skills to trust initiatives for developing successful approaches to Māori children’s progress and development.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and leaders agree that teachers should continue with current initiatives to maintain the kindergarten’s commitment and progress in enhancing the quality of education for children.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Elstree completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Elstree will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
