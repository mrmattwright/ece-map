</table><p>Superstart Childcare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Superstart Childcare in East Tamaki is licensed to provide education and care for up to 93 children, including a maximum of 15 under two years of age. Chinese children make up 70 percent of the roll, with smaller numbers of other ethnicities, including a few with Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre occupies extensive, purpose-built premises, with separate outdoor areas for younger and older children, and good facilities for staff. The area for infants and toddlers has been remodelled. Children's learning is supported in two areas, the Tui room for infants and toddlers up to three years of age, and the TƒÅkahe room for older children. There are additional two-hour programmes each day for four-year-old children.</p><p>Since ERO's 2016 review, the centre has changed ownership. Many of the staff, including the centre manager and two head teachers, have been employed in recent years. All teachers, including the service provider and manager, are registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The stated aim of the learning programme is to develop children's sense of belonging, and to foster their independence. Centre leaders are introducing Montessori learning approaches to parts of the learning programme, in response to parent aspirations and their own research about learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning is well supported by positive and respectful relationships with teachers. Children are confident to ask for assistance and enjoy interactions with each other. They understand the centre's routines and expectations, and benefit from the calm and orderly pace of the programme. Teaching approaches help children to respect equipment and complete learning tasks.</p><p>Learning resources have been selected to match the philosophy of learning through play. Children have opportunities for creativity, skill development and physical activity. Books, games and puzzles support their literacy and numeracy development in the context of their play. Children are choosing to engage independently in activities for longer periods of time.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's individual needs and interests, and work collegially to plan programmes that reflect emerging themes. They evaluate both the programmes and children's learning. Attractive displays show how children engage in the planning. Centre-wide professional development is strengthening teachers' evaluation practices.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and value the diverse multicultural community that they serve. They foster children's sense of identity and pride in their cultural heritage, customs and languages. All staff are committed to fostering te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. This commitment is evident in their teaching practice, the selection of resources and displays throughout the centre.</p><p>Teachers welcome parent involvement and encourage their contributions to learning plans. They provide good quality information about children's progress through daily conversations and in individual learning portfolios. Children with additional learning needs are well supported, in consultation with parents and appropriate external agencies.</p><p>Centre managers have undertaken comprehensive reviews across many areas of operations. There has been meaningful consultation with teachers and parents about the centre's new philosophy. Teachers are developing a shared understanding about promoting valued learning outcomes. Strategic and annual planning, internal evaluation, and planned teacher development support improvement priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that areas for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to build teaching teams' shared understanding about the goals and learning outcomes of the revised early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh</em>ƒÅ<em>riki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying appraisal procedures, so that teachers' reflective practice aligns more consistently with the Teaching Council's requirements for evidence based inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending the use of goal setting and action planning to enhance internal evaluation practice and ongoing centre-wide improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Superstart Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
