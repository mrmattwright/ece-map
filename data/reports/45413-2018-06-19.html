</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Te Totara is a not-for-profit community early learning centre. It is located in a growing suburban area in North Hamilton. Barnardos, the umbrella organisation, provides governance and management support. The multicultural centre is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 55 children, including 16 up to two years. At the time of this ERO review 73 children were enrolled. Currently the centre operates two mixed-aged rooms. All teachers in the centre hold early childhood qualifications.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2015, the long-standing centre manager has continued to be supported by a regional manager and a practice advisor to provide professional leadership in the centre. There have been some changes to the teaching staff, including a recently appointed teaching and learning leader from within the current team.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has been recently reviewed and aims to support and empower children to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learn through play and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build trust and respectful relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledge and respect diverse cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in meaningful play and learning experiences. There are opportunities for creative and sustained play with literacy and mathematics naturally integrated. Children have access to a wide range of appropriate resources where they can follow their strengths and interests. Transitions in and out of the centre are well managed in response to individual children‚Äôs needs. There is a strong sense of belonging for children and their families within this culturally diverse community. Children and their families benefit from this inclusive approach.</p><p>Teachers effectively promote positive learning outcomes for all children. Respectful and reciprocal interactions between teachers and children contribute to positive relationships for learning. Teachers support children to increasingly self manage their learning and care routines. The teaching team reflects the diversity of the centre‚Äôs community and actively seeks ways to maintain children‚Äôs connections to their cultural identity. Teachers are continuing to strengthen the MƒÅori dimension to allow children to develop an appreciation of New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Programme planning has recently been reviewed and this is supporting teachers to place further emphasis on addressing and documenting individual children‚Äôs learning and progress over time.</p><p>Centre personnel effectively communicate with parents. Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Parents value the open communication and responsive approach by staff. The introduction of an electronic planning and reporting tool has increased opportunities for parent participation and made children's learning and progress more visible. Children benefit from these positive partnerships focused on their care and learning.</p><p>The centre leadership is experienced and knowledgeable. They are well supported by a regional manager and practice advisor who are responsive to the centre's needs. Leaders have developed a culture where children come first and are affirmed and valued for who they are. Centre improvement is underpinned by effective internal evaluation which is currently focused on the implementation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum The centre manager works collaboratively with teachers to utilise their strengths and provide leadership opportunities. Leaders and teachers are reflective practitioners continually improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The Barnardos organisation provides effective governance for the centre. A clear philosophy and strategic plan guides the service operations. A well-developed policy framework underpins the centre‚Äôs operations and there are effective systems to support teacher induction into the centre. Sound governance processes support the service to provide positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre needs to fully implement the recently reviewed appraisal system to meet Education Council guidelines and expectations, including placing priority on giving documented feedback to teachers about their practice.</p><p>ERO and the centre agree there is a need to further strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation through the use of the online tool, to show the progression of children's learning and progress over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre Te Totara completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Early Learning Centre Te Totara will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>19 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
