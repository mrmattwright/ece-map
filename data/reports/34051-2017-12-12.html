</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Beachkids Waihi Beach is full day education and care centre located in the village of Waihi Beach. The centre is licensed for 32 children, including eight up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review the centre’s roll of 48 children included six of whom identify as Māori. The service operates two separate age groups, one for children under the age of two and one for children aged two to four years.  Each age group has its own outdoor environment which has recently been upgraded to provide for a more natural learning space.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims to provide children with an environment that enables both challenge and routine-based learning. Opportunities for independent exploration and movement are fostered. There is a strong focus on affirming children for who they are, their culture and family background.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2014, a new centre manager and two new teachers have been appointed. The owner/operator leads the management team which provides marketing and administration support and includes a professional learning co-ordinator. Teachers have undertaken professional learning and development to enhance their understanding of planning and assessment processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers promote a caring and affirming culture. They value and engage in reciprocal relationships where children's well being and belonging is supported. Respectful practice allows all children to fully participate in the learning programme. Children benefit from a collaborative team culture, and experience positive interactions that contribute to meaningful learning opportunities.</p><p>Teachers provide a well-considered environment of learning. Children are supported to develop curiosity and social competence in learning spaces that are regularly critiqued and reflected upon. Interestingly presented learning spaces support children to be creative and active explorers.</p><p>The centre provides a responsive and inclusive curriculum. Transition into, through and out of the centre follows the children’s natural rhythms and abilities. Children's literacy and numeracy are extended in a language rich learning environment, where they are encouraged to follow their interests and are empowered to make choices about their learning. Strong links are maintained with the community through regular trips and excursions. Children benefit from a curriculum where they are encouraged to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>There is a strong centre-wide focus on individual assessment and planning. An online portfolio system records children's experiences and learning opportunities. To further enhance this process leaders and teachers should develop a shared understanding and clear expectations for effective assessment practice.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are effectively catered for. Care routines are respectful and encourage self-help skills and emerging independence. Children up to the age of two years enjoy a calm and unhurried environment where teachers are responsive to their needs</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a commitment to promoting success for Māori children. They seek whānau aspirations to build their understanding of bi-cultural practices. Children are increasingly supported to build their knowledge of te reo Māori and tikanga practices through the use of waiata and karakia. Natural resources are becoming a feature of the centre as teachers explore the uniqueness that reflects the bicultural nature of the community. Children are valued as individuals and affirmed for what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Experienced leadership is building teacher capability. Planned and spontaneous self-review processes have led to some change and improvement to the environment and teaching practices. The teacher appraisal process has recently been reviewed and refined. However, there is now a need to align teachers’ appraisal goals with self-review and centre goals</p><p>The centre benefits from a clear sense of purpose and direction provided by the management team. The centres vision, mission and values have been established and are leading to systems and processes that guide daily operations. Management is currently reviewing the centre philosophy to better reflect the company’s goals for bi-culturalism. The strategic plan now needs to be further developed with clear and explicit indicators to guide and measure progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that:</p><ul>
<li>strategic planning needs to be further developed, with clear and explicit indicators of success to guide and measure progress over time</li>
<li>teachers' appraisal needs to be further embedded to ensure it aligns with strategic and annual goals, centre philosophy and self-review</li>
<li>teachers' inquiry should be research-based and strategically linked to ongoing review, reflection and improvement of practice</li>
<li>continuing to further refine the centre's bi-cultural curriculum will support teachers' improvement of the environment so that it authentically reflects te ao Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Beachkids Waihi Beach completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Beachkids Waihi Beach will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>12 December 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
