Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of The Treehouse on Ranolf was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at The Treehouse on Ranolf.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The Treehouse on Ranolf childcare centre is a privately owned all-day education and care centre located in Rotorua. It caters for infants, toddlers and young children. The centre is licensed under the 2008 regulations for 38 children. At the time of the review there were 46 children on the roll.</p><p align="left">The centre philosophy focuses on fostering development by &lsquo;empowering children to be happy and inquisitive learners who initiate and direct their own learning, supported by meaningful interactions with people, objects and the environment&rsquo;.</p><p align="left">Since the previous ERO review, staffing has remained stable with a new centre manager being mentored by the previous centre manager. Good progress has been made in response to the 2009 review recommendation about the use of ICT to enhance children&rsquo;s learning. Management and teachers have also worked hard to integrate a stronger bicultural dimension in centre practices. There has been extensive professional learning and development for staff in a variety of areas to further improve teaching practice.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Relationships and interactions:</b> Relationships and interactions at all levels are positive and respectful. Staff know children well, are good role models and work cooperatively in the best interests of children. Teachers are skilled at scaffolding children&rsquo;s interests to extend learning. Effective relationships exist with parents and wh&#257;nau, who are acknowledged as the children&rsquo;s first teachers. Centre staff place particular emphasis on ensuring parents and children feel welcome and valued within the centre.</p><p align="left"><b>Programmes:</b> Child-initiated and directed learning, based on children&rsquo;s interests, is central to centre programmes and is underpinned by Te Wh&#257;riki (the early childhood curriculum). There is quality individual planning for each child. A key teacher skilfully monitors a small group and plans for their learning. Group learning and development plans extend group interests, as well as individual interests that develop. Appropriate numeracy and literacy concepts are integrated within the programme. There are special provisions for infants and toddlers through access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration. Transition practices, based on individual needs, support children and parents as they move into and within the centre. Recent review and development of bicultural practices is resulting in the effective integration of many aspects of Te Ao M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left"><b>Planning and assessment:</b> Assessment provides ongoing information about children&rsquo;s learning and development, which is well used to cater for their strengths and interests. Learning stories, focused on individual development plans, identify the learning that is happening, progress being made, and relevant and personalised next steps. Parents are encouraged to have input into the planning and children&rsquo;s voice is increasingly being used in planning and assessment. Staff have good knowledge of all children and support the key teacher to ensure the best outcomes for children. Parents are very well informed about their children through twice-yearly parent interviews and regular emailing of learning stories.</p><p align="left"><b>Learning environment:</b> A calm, settled and safe environment supports children&rsquo;s individual and group exploration and risk taking. A range of interesting activities allows them to make choices about creative and complex play. Well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas are complemented by a large, all-weather outdoor facility. The centre is increasingly using more natural resources and children are involved in decision making on environmental matters.</p><p align="left"><b>Self review:</b> Self review is a feature of the centre and is used to inform decision making and continually improve centre operations. Strategic, regular and emergent self reviews are well analysed and encompass the views of all stakeholders. There is a clear purpose to all review with a strong focus on teaching and learning outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Leadership and management:</b> The centre is effectively led and managed in the best interests of children, staff and parents. There are well-defined roles and expectations for management and staff. The strategic plan provides a strong sense of purpose and direction for the centre. The manager provides sound leadership and guidance for staff, with the support of the previous centre manager. Regular, analysed professional development and effective appraisal processes support staff to enhance teaching practices. The collaborative team approach of the staff provides good-quality care and education for all centre children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that the centre should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a more natural learning environment;</li>
<li>foster further wh&#257;nau/family engagement in children&rsquo;s learning; and</li>
<li>enhance children&rsquo;s learning experiences through ICT.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of The Treehouse on Ranolf completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-the-treehouse-on-ranolf" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of The Treehouse on Ranolf</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on The Treehouse on Ranolf<b>.</b></p><p align="left">The Treehouse on Ranolf childcare centre is a privately owned all-day education and care centre located in Rotorua. It caters for infants, toddlers and young children. The centre is licensed for 38 children. At the time of the review there were 46 children on the roll.</p><p align="left">The centre philosophy focuses on fostering development by &lsquo;empowering children to be happy and inquisitive learners who initiate and direct their own learning&rsquo;. They are to be supported by meaningful interactions with people, objects and the environment.</p><p align="left">Child-initiated and directed learning based on children&rsquo;s interests is central to centre programmes. Each child has a key teacher who skilfully monitors the child and plans for their learning. Appropriate numeracy and literacy concepts, and bicultural practices are integrated within the programme. Infants and toddlers have access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration.</p><p align="left">Relationships and interactions at all levels are positive and respectful. Staff know children well, are good role models, and work cooperatively in the best interests of children. Effective relationships exist with parents and wh&#257;nau, who are acknowledged as the children&rsquo;s first teachers.</p><p align="left">A calm, settled and safe environment supports children&rsquo;s individual and group exploration and risk taking. A range of interesting activities allows children to make choices about creative and complex play. Well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas are complemented by a large, all-weather outdoor facility. The centre is increasingly using more natural resources and children help to make decisions about environmental matters.</p><p align="left">Learning stories provide ongoing information about children&rsquo;s learning, strengths and interests. Parents are encouraged to have input into the planning of individual development programmes and children&rsquo;s voice is increasingly being used in planning and assessment. Parents are very well informed about their children through twice yearly parent interviews and regular emailing of learning stories.</p><p align="left">The centre is effectively led and managed in the best interests of children, staff and parents. Regular professional development and effective appraisal processes support staff to enhance teaching practices. The collaborative team approach of the staff provides good quality care and education for all children in the centre.</p><p align="left">The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that a next step is to continue to develop a more natural learning environment, foster further wh&#257;nau/family engagement in children&rsquo;s learning, and enhance children&rsquo;s learning experiences through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
