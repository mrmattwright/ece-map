</table><p>The service will provide ERO with an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiapu Kids - St. Matthews Early Childhood Centre is located near the central business district of Hastings. It is one of a number of centres governed by Anglican Care Waiapu, whose purpose is to deliver and support high quality Christian social services.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs focus is to provide education and care in a Christian environment that supports children as independent learners. A weekly transition programme with the adjoining St Matthew's School is established to assist children's movement into school.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 35 children from birth to school within a mixed-aged group setting. Children from diverse cultural backgrounds attend the service.</p><p>Significant changes in staffing at governance and leadership level have occurred since the June 2014 ERO report. There is a newly-appointed chief executive, a regional director and centre manager. The day-to-day operation of the centre is delegated to the centre manager, who reports to the regional director. She is supported by a supervisor who shares responsibility for curriculum implementation and guiding teaching practice.</p><p>Use of internal evaluation supports access to resources and broadens teachers' awareness of culturally responsive practices for children and families new to New Zealand. This remains an area for ongoing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A sustained focus on improving the outdoor area has increased opportunities for children to participate in physical activities. Children demonstrate positive interactions with their peers, within a mixed-age group setting. It is now timely to revisit the centre philosophy and the learning outcomes of the updated curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> to establish a shared team understanding of the centre curriculum and effective teaching practices.</p><p>Children's diverse cultures are celebrated and acknowledged within the programme. Teachers continue to build their understanding of the uniqueness of each child's family to support their needs and actively seek their aspirations. Some useful resources that are familiar to children's culture, language and identity have been developed to promote their sense of belonging.</p><p>Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are evident in the environment and some teachers use te reo MƒÅori confidently. Children have regular opportunities to go on excursions into the community. These link to a group focus. In partnership with MƒÅori and Pacific families, a key next step is for teachers to consider how they can draw on cultural information to develop targeted strategies that promote the educational success of MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>Learning assessment stories successfully capture children's participation and enjoyment in a range of activities. Group planning is informed by children's emerging interests. Literacy and mathematical concepts are woven through some stories. A next step is to develop the planning process to support children's emerging interests and progression of individual learning overtime. Teachers should strengthen their understanding of culturally responsive practices to inform this process.</p><p>Teachers liaise appropriately with families and outside agencies to support children with diverse needs. A more focused and coordinated approach to supporting the specific requirements of children is required to improve teaching practices. Leaders must continue to support teachers' understanding and use of agreed positive behaviour strategies. Developing individual learning plans for children should promote more consistent implementation of appropriate strategies. This is a priority.</p><p>Processes to support growth of professional practice and leadership require further development. Collation and reflection on evidence related to meeting the professional standards of the teaching profession are evident in the appraisal process. To improve this process, a key next step is to clarify the use of goals, observations, feedback and feed forward to support growth in professional practices and leadership of learning.</p><p>Self review is used well to support ongoing developments and revisiting of some key areas of teaching practices, including provisions for infants and toddlers. There is a clear focus on enhancing the centre environment and resources for children. Shifting the focus of the internal evaluation process to support improved teaching and learning practices is a key next step.</p><p>Governance and management are working on strengthening processes to improve outcomes for children. A cohesive policy framework and increased access by staff to professional learning and development are established. Leaders agree with ERO's findings that monitoring and support to grow leadership capability and teaching requires improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Increased support for leaders and teachers in this service is required to strengthen and improve practice in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisiting the centre philosophy and the learning outcomes of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to establish a shared team understanding about the centre curriculum and effective teaching practices, including culturally responsive strategies for MƒÅori and other priority groups of learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning, including individual learning plans and strategies to support positive behaviour guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the appraisal process to clarify the use of goals, observations, feedback and feed forward to support growth in professional practice and leadership of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation to support improved teaching and learning practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite stage of the review, leaders have provided evidence of immediate actions that have been taken in response to these priorities.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The service will provide ERO with an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement will continue to be addressed. ERO will request progress updates.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiapu Kids - St. Matthews Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiapu Kids - St. Matthews Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>12 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
