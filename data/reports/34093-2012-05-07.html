<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. operates successfully as a community-based centre, providing education and care for children over the age of two. It is located in the Kimihia area of Huntly and offers sessional and all-day programmes. Committee members who operate the service make decisions that are informed by current educational thinking, focus on building teacher capability and promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The supervisor provides insightful and reflective professional leadership for the centre. She works with her team in a manner that empowers all members to make a contribution, share leadership roles, and extend their own professional learning and development as teachers.</p><p>Teachers have a sound understanding of their role as co-learners alongside children. They are perceptive and skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths, interest and abilities. ERO observed many instances where teachers capitalised on children&rsquo;s self-chosen play to extend their learning and interest. In addition, children were engaged in sustained and complex play with and alongside their peers.</p><p>Features of the centre&rsquo;s programme include the close, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children, their families and wh&#257;nau. There is natural inclusion of the M&#257;ori language and culture in a manner that is responsive to the aspirations of M&#257;ori children, their parents and wh&#257;nau. Parents and teachers have a focus on sustainable practices, particularly in relation to gardening, harvesting, processing and caring for the environment. Teachers promote meaningful, &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; experiences that foster children&rsquo;s interest in literacy, mathematics, science, creative expression, and physical challenge and exploration.</p><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to develop a new strategic plan that includes a more formal approach to self review. This should provide an exciting opportunity for management, teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau to contribute to the ongoing development and success of the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Mana Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the services&rsquo; vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou&#257;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc.</p><h3>How well placed is Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. provides all-day and sessional education and care for children over the age of two. The centre provides an extension group for older children. Since the previous ERO review the centre has redeveloped the outdoor area. In addition, a number of teachers have gained their qualifications, resulting in high levels of trained and experienced teachers being employed. The centre aims to provide affordable high-quality education and care for children in an environment where they will develop as confident and competent learners.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Community of Learners</h4><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. is governed by knowledgeable and dedicated parent and wh&#257;nau representatives. Consultation and open communication with the wider parent body contribute to responsive and positive centre development. Committee members make decisions that are informed by current educational thinking, and focus on building teacher capability and promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The supervisor provides insightful and reflective professional leadership for the centre. She works with her team in a manner that empowers all members to make a contribution, share leadership roles, and extend their own professional learning and development as teachers. Current emphases for the centre include integration of aspects of the Reggio Emila approach and inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Inclusive and informed leadership is contributing to the provision of rich and stimulating learning opportunities and experiences for young children.</p><p>Management and teachers have a shared vision. This vision aims to ensure that each child is acknowledged as being special and unique, and nurtured to grow as competent and confident learners and communicators. The centre&rsquo;s curriculum is clearly linked to the principles and strands of Te Wh&#257;riki. Particular emphases and priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>developing close, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children their families and wh&#257;nau</li>
<li>valuing child and family contributions to the programme</li>
<li>connectedness with the wider community</li>
<li>sustainable practices, particularly in relation to gardening, harvesting and processing and caring for the environment</li>
<li>meaningful, &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; experiences that foster children&rsquo;s interest in literacy, mathematics, science, creative expression, physical challenge and exploration</li>
<li>respectful and natural inclusion of the M&#257;ori language and culture in a manner that is responsive to the aspirations of M&#257;ori children, their parents and wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have a sound understanding of their role as co-learners alongside children. They are perceptive and skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and abilities. Teachers have developed useful processes for documenting assessment, planning, evaluation, and self review. These include comprehensive individual profiles, meaningful displays and resources that make learning visible. ERO observed many instances where teachers capitalised on children&rsquo;s self-chosen play to extend their learning and interest. In addition, children were engaged in sustained and complex play with and alongside their peers.</p><h3>Agreed priorities for development and review</h3><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to develop a new strategic plan that includes a more formal approach to self review. These developments provide an exciting opportunity for management, teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau to contribute to the ongoing development and success of the centre. Points to consider in this planning include:</p><ul>
<li>a philosophy review that provides a shared understanding of how aspects of the Reggio Emila approach fits within this community of learners in Aotearoa/New Zealand</li>
<li>professional learning and development that is linked to appraisal, centre goals and supports teachers to extend their practice and develop shared expectations that are appropriate to this educational context</li>
<li>rationalisation and refinement of assessment practice to enhance manageability and maximise the use of this information</li>
<li>ways to further empower children as decision-makers and directors of their own learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>7 May 2012</p><p>To the Parents and Community of Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc.</p><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc.</p><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. operates successfully as a community-based centre, providing education and care for children over the age of two. It is located in the Kimihia area of Huntly and offers sessional and all-day programmes. Committee members who operate the service make decisions that are informed by current educational thinking, focus on building teacher capability and promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The supervisor provides insightful and reflective professional leadership for the centre. She works with her team in a manner that empowers all members to make a contribution, share leadership roles, and extend their own professional learning and development as teachers.</p><p>Teachers have a sound understanding of their role as co-learners alongside children. They are perceptive and skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths, interest and abilities. ERO observed many instances where teachers capitalised on children&rsquo;s self-chosen play to extend their learning and interest. In addition, children were engaged in sustained and complex play with and alongside their peers.</p><p>Features of the centre&rsquo;s programme include the close, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children, their families and wh&#257;nau. There is natural inclusion of the M&#257;ori language and culture in a manner that is responsive to the aspirations of M&#257;ori children, their parents and wh&#257;nau. Parents and teachers have a focus on sustainable practices, particularly in relation to gardening, harvesting, processing and caring for the environment. Teachers promote meaningful, &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; experiences that foster children&rsquo;s interest in literacy, mathematics, science, creative expression, and physical challenge and exploration.</p><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to develop a new strategic plan that includes a more formal approach to self review. This should provide an exciting opportunity for management, teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau to contribute to the ongoing development and success of the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
