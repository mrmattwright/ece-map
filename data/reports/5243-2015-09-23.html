</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Marie McFarland Kindergarten is situated in Whanganui. It is one of 14 kindergartens administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten operates under an all-day licence for up to 40 children, over two years of age. Teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The governing board is responsible for setting overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the general manager, who is responsible to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of staff. Two cultural advisors were recently appointed to support teachers to realise the potential of and success for MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>Sustained progress has been made since the September 2012 ERO report. This has been well supported by focused professional learning and development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enthusiastically participate in a curriculum that responds to their interests, strengths and ideas. Learning experiences enhance understandings of literacy, mathematics, science and nature concepts. The priorities for children‚Äôs learning are strongly evident in all aspects of the curriculum, including assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy focuses on priorities for children‚Äôs learning: ‚Äòenvironment, community involvement, social competence, school readiness and let‚Äôs get physical.‚Äô These priorities are evident in the inclusive and respectful practices that nurture relationships with children and their families.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to explore and enjoy the stimulating environment. They demonstrate confidence and high levels of independence. Relationships between children and teachers are warm and open. Adults intentionally interact with each child in ways that extend and enrich learning. They speak to children in calm and gentle ways. The atmosphere is peaceful and purposeful.</p><p>The 'Priorities for Children‚Äôs Learning' initiative was guided by the senior teacher‚Äôs response to a recent ERO national evaluation report. This provides a useful framework which has strengthened assessment, planning and evaluation processes in each kindergarten.</p><p>Portfolios and kindergarten displays celebrate each child‚Äôs learning and development. Children demonstrate high levels of ownership of these records. WhƒÅnau contribute with their stories and photographs from home.</p><p>Assessment focuses on dispositions, priorities for children‚Äôs learning and parent aspirations, as well as skills and ways of knowing. Leaders and teachers agree that they should investigate how best to record what has been noticed about children‚Äôs interests. This should better guide planning and alignment with the agreed priorities.</p><p>Children at Marie McFarland kindergarten experience a culturally responsive curriculum. A Pacific teacher is a staff member. Children are surrounded with the symbols, language and songs of their cultures.</p><p>Successful transitions are well supported by effective partnerships between whƒÅnau, the kindergarten and schools. This supports children to reach their potential through visits between the kindergarten and school. Mutual conversations occur about the knowledge children bring to school and connections are made between <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and<em>The¬†New¬†Zealand Curriculum.</em></p><p>Collaborative teamwork is a feature of the kindergarten. Leadership is distributed and includes teachers, parents and children. Everyone involved at the kindergarten is empowered to make a contribution. Leaders establish a culture in which children are valued and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Highly inclusive practices help all children and whƒÅnau to celebrate their difference by reinforcing the rights of individuals to be different.</p><p>Appraisal is improvement focused. Leaders and teachers are reflective practitioners. The inclusion of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> contributes positively to the enactment of culturally responsive practices and the kindergarten‚Äôs strong bicultural perspective. The head teacher has identified that teachers should align their professional goals to the kindergarten‚Äôs priorities for children‚Äôs learning. ERO supports this direction.</p><p>Self review is strongly focused on improving learning outcomes for all children. It embraces parent aspirations and the priorities for children's learning. Strong links are made to the association‚Äôs strategic plan and the kindergarten action plan. The development of further links between self review and appraisal is an agreed next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, general manager, head teacher, teachers and ERO agree that the following are key next steps:</p><ul>
<li>refining aspects of assessment practice</li>
<li>continuing to align teacher appraisal and self review with the priorities for children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>The senior managers of the Whanganui Kindergarten Association acknowledge that they should continue to further build teachers, capability to be responsive to MƒÅori and Pacific children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities. ERO affirms this.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Marie McFarland Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Marie McFarland Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
