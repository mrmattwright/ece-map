</table><p>Nga Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited¬†is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>NgƒÅ Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited operates in a renovated building and is licensed for 30 tamariki, including up to five under two years of age. The centre provides education and care in a te reo MƒÅori bilingual setting. Most of the children attending are MƒÅori and half whakapapa to Te Rarawa.</p><p>The owner/director delegates daily operations to a centre manager. The manager and two kaiako are registered teachers. There are also two unqualified kaiawhina and a kaikihini.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships between tamariki, whƒÅnau, kaiako and the community. It includes an "it takes an iwi to raise a child" approach. Kaiako are involved in the Far North Community of Learning | KƒÅhui Ako.</p><p>ERO's 2017 report identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management, the quality of the curriculum, and health and safety. The Ministry of Education has provided significant support to help staff improve their practices. However, insufficient progress has been made and some non-compliances relating to health and safety have not been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki quickly settle into the welcoming environment and show enjoyment in their play. They have opportunities for creative and imaginative play, and access to a range of resources. Routines for the care of infants are individualised. These pƒìpi have opportunities for quiet exploration and for forming relationships with older tamariki.</p><p>Kaiako relationships with tamariki and their whƒÅnau are caring and respectful. Some kaiako work skilfully alongside tamariki during their play. They are highly inclusive and supportive of children with additional needs. Some kaiako have high levels of te reo MƒÅori that support the bilingual intent of the centre's curriculum. It is timely to review how well kai and group time routines support children's independence and engagement in learning.</p><p>Kaiako have participated in professional development that has helped them understand how to assess children's learning. However, over the past 12 months they have not used their new knowledge well. They have not consistently recorded what they know, or considered how they can extend children's play or add complexity to children's learning. There is no evidence that curriculum responsiveness to the interests of tamariki has been planned or evaluated.</p><p>The centre manager has worked with an external provider to develop operational systems, including reviewing required policies, developing job descriptions, and writing a strategic plan. These developments are new and now need to be implemented. Support is needed for staff to learn about teacher appraisal processes that meet the requirements of the Teaching Council. The centre manager must also be appraised annually.</p><p>As a result of professional development, all staff have improved their understanding of internal evaluation processes for the purpose of improvement. However, the teaching team is not sufficiently carrying out or documenting this aspect of their work. The monitoring of health and safety requirements should be improved.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nga Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, health and safety, and governance and management. To meet requirements, the service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adults carry out earthquake drills and evaluate all drills to inform the annual review of the service's emergency plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's bedding is hygienically stored when not in use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>records of excursions include parental approval of identified adult-to-child ratios and the mode of transport</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a process of self-evaluation helps the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system of regular appraisal is implemented for all staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1,2, HS8,11,17, GMA6,7.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Nga Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
