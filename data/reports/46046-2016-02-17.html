</table><p>Wee Nippers Early Childhood Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wee Nippers Early Childhood Centre opened in 2012. It is privately owned and purpose built to provide education and care for children from 3 months to 6 years of age. The children are cared for and learn in four different rooms, according to their age and development. The roll reflects the diversity of the community.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is based around respect, excellent communication and relationships with children, staff, parents, whƒÅnau and community. Nearly all the teachers are qualified early childhood teachers or training to become early childhood teachers. The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. The co-owners are also the directors and have a hands-on approach that supports their oversight of the centre‚Äôs operations.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy, secure and well settled. They have many opportunities to extend their learning and language either in a group or independently. Teachers encourage children to be confident and competent communicators. Children actively learn together and from each other. Older children greatly benefit from the rich learning experiences in and beyond the centre. They confidently lead their own learning and share experiences with their teachers and friends.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are nurtured in a calm and unhurried way. Teachers readily seek advice and guidance from appropriate agencies in order to meet the special needs of some children. Priority learners are very well supported in the centre.</p><p>MƒÅori children are able to hear and use te reo MƒÅori often. Group activities where older children support and guide their younger peers, reflect MƒÅori ways of learning. Teachers have begun using the home languages of other children. Parents are regularly invited to share aspects of their cultural background with staff.</p><p>Teachers plan a range of experiences to enhance children‚Äôs learning and development. Children have access to a variety of resources that extend their problem-solving skills. Transitions into and within the centre are flexible, child paced and well managed. Teachers of the older children have developed good relationships with the local school to help the children transition smoothly.</p><p>Parents are well informed of the activities and experiences planned to meet children‚Äôs needs and interests. They have good opportunities to contribute to their children‚Äôs learning stories. Managers arrange parent evenings where relevant and useful information about aspects of education and care is shared.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. The centre manager uses the skills and experience of the staff to contribute to the centre‚Äôs shared leadership. The staff have developed an evaluative self-review process that is effectively targeted and focused on ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The directors, centre manager and ERO agree some aspects of centre operations could be further improved. These include:</p><ul>
<li>consistently identifying children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>recording and evaluating the intentional teaching and learning that occurs in the programme as a result</li>
<li>strengthening the consistency of the appraisal process for all staff</li>
<li>increasing the bicultural aspects in teaching practice and key documentation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wee Nippers Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>17 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">
