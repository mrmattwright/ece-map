Management set high expectations for service delivery and provide a comprehensive range of policies and procedures to guide professional practice at all levels.

Local leaders and managers foster good quality education and care and help support ongoing improvements to the service.</p><p>The visiting teachers, who are qualified early childhood teachers, regularly visit children in the educator&rsquo;s homes.

For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The Awa Kai Rangi network operates under the umbrella of Barnardos New Zealand. It is one of 11 managed through the KidStart Lower Hutt office. Significant restructuring of Barnardos early childhood services took place in 2011. A business manager oversees all 11 networks and has led the team positively through the changes. A team leader supports and monitors the work of the two visiting teachers. Educators in this network, which covers a wide catchment area from Petone to Upper Hutt, are all experienced caregivers. All educators have initial and ongoing professional learning opportunities and receive a practice certificate from Barnardos that is renewed every two years. Enthusiastic educators run workshops for their peers and facilitate the sharing of ideas.</p><p>A practice leader works with visiting teachers and educators to improve the effectiveness of the education programme. The visiting teachers mentor the in-home educators and are responsible for maintaining health and safety standards. A recently released handbook contains relevant policies and procedures to guide educators in their work.</p><p>This ERO review evaluates the quality of education and care provided by a sample of educators and the quality of support provided by Barnardos KidStart management.</p><h4>Review Findings</h4><p>Children receive high quality care. Close bonds between children and educators and a sense of belonging are highly evident. Emotional well-being is nurtured through warm, responsive interactions. New children are quickly settled. Educators know the children and their families well and respond promptly to children&rsquo;s verbal and non-verbal communication. Children relate well to each other in the family-like atmosphere.</p><p>Trusting relationships are well established between children, educators and parents. As well as the daily two-way exchange of information, there is regular contact between the visiting teacher and the parents. There are good lines of communication across the service.</p><p>Visiting teachers play a pivotal role in developing strong relationships between children, educators and families. They endeavour to offer flexible choices of educator to match the aspirations and needs of families and are responsive to educator and parent requests. Visiting teachers mentor educators to build capability and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from a varied and stimulating programme. They are highly engaged in activities of choice and other meaningful learning experiences. Children&rsquo;s oral language is effectively fostered through sustained interactions with adults. Good provision is made for extending physical abilities and thinking skills. Some children experience rich cultural perspectives in educators&rsquo; homes. These either reflect their own language and family background or familiarise them with another culture.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning and interests are enhanced through frequent visits in the wider community including trips to parks, the library, gymnasiums and other local events. The weekly KidStart playgroup provides additional social contact for both children and educators. Visiting teachers plan activities around children&rsquo;s interests. They also appropriately use the playgroup to model good practice and build educators&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>Educators provide an appropriate range of equipment to respond to children&rsquo;s interests and development. KidStart supplements these as necessary. Visiting teachers have produced several resources to support educators to include te ao M&#257;ori in the programme. Leaders have identified the following areas as requiring continued development:</p><ul>
<li>increasing visiting teacher&rsquo;s and educator&rsquo;s confidence and use of te reo M&#257;ori and exploring ways to promote success for M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>including more regular and meaningful early literacy experiences in programmes and providing more sensory and natural materials for infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><p>Self review practice is developing. It is undertaken collaboratively and decisions are based on evidence. The focus is on improved outcomes for children. The appraisal process supports professional growth for the visiting teachers and educators.</p><ul>
<li>To build self review as a tool for improvement leaders and visiting teachers need to develop a stronger understanding of each stage of a planned in-depth process. A regional plan aligned to Barnardos national and M&#257;ori strategic plans should guide long-term direction.</li>
</ul><p>Assessment practice has been strengthened through self review and professional development. Educators now have a stronger focus on children&rsquo;s learning and are beginning to respond to what they notice. Best examples of entries in children&rsquo;s records of learning (t&#333;ku pukapuka) show links to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, next learning steps, and links to previous stories and interests, with contributions from parents and visiting teachers. Educators have responded well to the raised expectations and state that having responsibility for assessment has given new insight into children&rsquo;s play and learning and how they can support and extend this.</p><ul>
<li>Managers agree there is a need to continue to build educators&rsquo; understanding and practice of narrative assessment.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Barnardos KidStart Awa Kai Rangi completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
