</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avenues Educare in the Woodhill area of Whangarei has a long history as an early childhood service. It is the oldest community-based centre in Whangarei and operates as an incorporated society, formerly known as Northland Residential Nursery and Creche. The service provides education and care for up to 40 children, including a maximum of 16 less than two years of age.</p><p>A committee of elected parents is responsible for the governance of the centre. The committee appoints a centre manager who is the professional leader as well as the person responsible for the running of daily operations and systems.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report recommended a plan be put in place, with consultation from the Ministry of Education, to address key steps and actions for improvement, outlined in that report.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs findings in this report confirm that over the past year, rapid and substantial progress has been made with this action plan. Leaders and teachers‚Äô professional practice has been strengthened from the external expertise used during 2014 in the areas of self review, strategic planning and appraisal processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The development of the centre‚Äôs vision and philosophy is purposeful. The vision and philosophy are now more visible in the centre‚Äôs strategic planning. The philosophy will continue to be evaluated annually. Leaders, teachers, staff, the parent committee and parents are involved in this review process. This is contributing to the good quality of connections established between teachers and families.</p><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and are benefitting from the friendly, trusting relationships they have with staff. Children are highly engaged in their learning activities. They are learning social competencies and work cooperatively together for sustained periods of time. Routines do not interrupt the flow of their play.</p><p>Good quality interactions between children and teachers are evident. Care routines foster positive attachments between children and adults. The ratio of children to teachers is very generous. The environment in the babies‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô room has been modified to create a quiet and settled atmosphere. Children who need additional help with their learning are sensitively supported.</p><p>The centre is very well resourced. Children are able to access their own choice of play materials and equipment from an abundance of sources. Creative and dramatic play scenarios are encouraged. The outside area is spacious and offers good physical challenge. Natural shade is provided by mature trees.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum follows the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Programmes are based on children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities. Bicultural approaches to the curriculum continue to be developed. The Kowhai Room curriculum supports children‚Äôs readiness for school.</p><p>Connections between assessment and planning are supporting individual children‚Äôs learning and interests. Teachers use their observations of children‚Äôs play to guide programme planning and evaluation. Parents contribute their aspirations and ideas to programme planning. These learning partnerships with parents are valued by the centre.</p><p>Assessment records for individual children are presented in portfolios. There are concise, insightful stories about children‚Äôs individual learning journeys, supported by visual records. Children‚Äôs next learning steps are well documented and their learning progress over time is shown.</p><p>Compliance actions relating to children‚Äôs safety, together with governance, management and administration issues from 2014, have been appropriately addressed. For example, teaching staff are now appraised against statements from <em>The Registered Teachers Criteria</em>.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are working with self review processes to improve outcomes for children. ERO and centre leaders agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to position the individual learner within programme planning</li>
<li>regularly reviewing strategic goals to guide the centre‚Äôs future direction</li>
<li>aligning teachers‚Äô appraisal goals to related goals in strategic planning</li>
<li>working towards te reo MƒÅori being heard as well as seen in the centre environment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avenues EduCare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve centre practice, a hazards register should be used to record relevant issues in the centre‚Äôs environment and actions taken to avoid potential harm.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avenues EduCare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
