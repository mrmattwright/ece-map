</table><p>Just Kids Community Preschool is now well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Just Kids Community Preschool is managed by the Families for Life Trust. It operates out of the trust‚Äôs community complex in Wainoni and provides learning and care for children from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. The centre offers support for children and their families, many of whom are still dealing with issues arising from the 2011 Canterbury Earthquakes.</p><p>Just Kids Community Preschool provides all day care for children from birth to five years of age. In 2015 an additional room was established to create a second area for under two year old children. There are now four classrooms across two separate buildings.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs recently reviewed philosophy strongly focuses on family and whƒÅnau involvement, and emphasises play as the basis for children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review identified a number of significant areas for development. These included a need for better processes for:</p><ul>
<li>children‚Äôs assessment for learning</li>
<li>self review across all aspects of the centre</li>
<li>performance management for all staff.</li>
</ul><p>During 2013 and 2014 the centre received extensive professional development from a number of external agencies, including the Ministry of Education. The centre managers and teachers have made effective use of these opportunities to make good progress towards meeting the ERO recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Trustees, managers and teachers have a shared understanding of the centre‚Äôs vision for its future direction. They have responded well to change, and are focused on supporting improved outcomes for children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is clearly evident in daily practices. Children have choices within the programme. They play well independently, and with others for sustained periods of time. Children can access both the spacious indoor and outdoor areas throughout the day and are provided with a varied range of equipment and activities.</p><p>Teachers are purposefully involved in children‚Äôs play and learning. They engage children in conversations and encourage children‚Äôs oral language develop and self managing skills.</p><p>Children up to two years learn well in small groups. This allows them to form sensitive and nurturing relationships with their teachers. A flexible approach supports children and their families as they move through to the preschool areas.</p><p>Children‚Äôs home cultures are acknowledged within the centre. Use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, and the Samoan language and culture is strongly visible in the programme.</p><p>Centre managers and teachers have been extensively involved with external professional development providers. This has helped to improve teachers‚Äô understanding and use of assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices. There is now a stronger focus on the ways teachers are noticing and documenting individual children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and regularly share information about children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. Managers and team leaders have encouraged a culture of reflection and greater sharing of practice within and across the teaching teams. They make good use of individual teacher strengths and provide opportunities to grow their leadership skills.</p><p>The centre is well supported by the board of trustees. Centre managers regularly communicate with and report to the board about progress towards the centre‚Äôs shared goals. They have established specific job descriptions and a formalised appraisal process for all staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers have used self review well to ensure ongoing improvements. They have recognised, and ERO confirms, that they need to build on and embed the initiatives that have been introduced since the 2013 ERO review. Priority should continue to be given to:</p><ul>
<li>completing the current curriculum review to ensure that learning programmes meet the needs of all children</li>
<li>extending all teachers‚Äô understanding and use of high quality assessment and programme evaluation processes</li>
<li>strengthening teachers‚Äô confidence, knowledge and use of bicultural practices within all aspects of the centre‚Äôs operation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Kids Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO found that some policies and procedures need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect current best practice. Centre managers also need to ensure that teachers are applying policies and procedures at all times.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Just Kids Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>23 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>
