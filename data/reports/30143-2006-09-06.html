<p class="ReportText1stPara">PORSE (Play, Observe, Record, Support, Extend, Evaluate) Horoeka is an early childhood home-based care service located in Christchurch.&nbsp; Children are cared for in their own homes by a nanny/educator, or in the homes of educators who are registered with PORSE.&nbsp; The service is guided by a strong philosophy, which upholds the concept of children developing at their own pace within a home environment.&nbsp; The early childhood curriculum, Te Wh&auml;riki, informs the practice of qualified <br> programme/manager tutors and the educators they support and advise.&nbsp; A feature of the service is the high level of involvement by parents in the care and education of their children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">This education review evaluates the quality of education and care received while with PORSE Horoeka, with particular emphasis on the programme, interactions, and learning environments.&nbsp; It also evaluates how the service is progressing with self review and meeting qualification requirements.&nbsp; This evaluation should be read in conjunction with PORSE management review report.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The programme manager/tutor effectively supports educator practice and regularly visits homes.&nbsp; She communicates with families about educator training and encourages their participation and contribution to their child&rsquo;s programme.&nbsp; Parents are kept informed about their child&rsquo;s learning through a variety of approaches, including access to well presented individual journals.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s learning is valued and shared.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children demonstrate a sense of wellbeing and belonging, with caring, nurturing educators.&nbsp; Learning and development is fostered through a variety of activities equipment and community outings.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Parents indicate satisfaction with the service.&nbsp; Families value the small group learning, the monitoring of standards, consistent adult interactions with children and the familiarity of the environment experienced in PORSE childcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Playschool programmes give children a range of alternative activities for exploration and for developing thinking and reasoning skills.&nbsp; In this venue adults work alongside children as they play and learn.&nbsp; Consequently their learning is enhanced.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The programme manager/tutor assists nanny/educators to identify the importance of professional development.&nbsp; ERO agrees with this commitment to participate in ongoing training to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Managers take all reasonable steps to ensure homes are safe physical and emotional environments.</p>
<p class="MSHeading2">Future Action</p>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<a id="3-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of PORSE In-home Childcare Horoeka was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE In-home Childcare Horoeka to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE In-home Childcare Horoeka.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; <br> For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="HiddenReportText">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">PORSE Horoeka provides a service to children and their families in Christchurch.&nbsp; There is an expectation that educators will support the learning and development of each child through the provision of quality education and care.&nbsp; The programme manager/tutor regularly visits children in care, consults with families and monitors educators.&nbsp; PORSE management and ERO agreed that this review would focus on the quality of education and care received by children.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Programme<br> Child directed play is effectively catered for and encouraged in accordance with PORSE philosophy.&nbsp; Educators respond skilfully to children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and needs.&nbsp; Planning generally incorporates relevant links to Te Wh&#257;riki.&nbsp; Literacy, numeracy and science are features within home programmes.&nbsp; This learning occurs appropriately in the context of play.&nbsp; Topics of interest sometimes develop into projects that continue over time.&nbsp; These are recorded in specific books allowing children to revisit past experience and enhance literacy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Children frequently establish links with the community and wider world.&nbsp; Regular outings are planned to extend children&rsquo;s knowledge about places, things and events.&nbsp; As a result children&rsquo;s understanding about their community is deepened.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Journals are attractive, well presented records of learning and development.&nbsp; Children contribute to their journals and confidently select samples of work that they value.&nbsp; Some nanny/educators use Information Communication Technology (ICT) effectively to document and share significant moments.&nbsp; Learning is made visible.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Play school provides an extension of the home programme.&nbsp; Children access a wide range of learning experiences and resources.&nbsp; This setting provides extensive opportunities for professional development and networking among educators.&nbsp; Children have fun in a larger group.&nbsp; <br> <br> The dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand is generally reflected in programmes and resources.&nbsp; The programme manager/tutor supports educators to develop confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori and implementing a bicultural awareness in homes and playschool.&nbsp; Children are developing cultural respect.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactions<br> Warm and responsive relationships occur between each child, nanny/educators and the programme manager/tutor.&nbsp; Children are well supported in their play by attentive adults who are highly attuned to their ideas.&nbsp; They make suggestions and contribute to resources to assist the development of play.&nbsp; Nanny/educators respect children&rsquo;s decisions promoting independence, learning and problem solving.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Adults engage children in sustained conversations and generally make appropriate use of questioning techniques and reflection.&nbsp; Children are competent and confident learners and communicators.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The programme manager/tutor and nanny/educators are developing effective partnerships with parents.&nbsp; Families are provided with detailed information about children&rsquo;s learning experiences through journals, newsletters, projects and informal discussions.&nbsp; Parents have opportunities to contribute to children&rsquo;s programmes of learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children are familiar and comfortable with relaxed routines.&nbsp; Their behaviour demonstrates that they are secure and trusting with the educators.&nbsp; Children show initiative, are creative, and participate and assert themselves as individuals.&nbsp; Their growing independence is fostered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning environment<br> Children explore and experience learning through the provision of well-planned activities and resources.&nbsp; Educators make effective use of community facilities to extend the learning environment, such as libraries and gymnasiums.&nbsp; In homes, children have fun, make decisions, ask for things and make choices about whether to participate.&nbsp; Children engage confidently with their surroundings.</li>

<a id="4-areas-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Areas of National Interest</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports.&nbsp; This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<p class="ReportText">ERO collected information about PORSE In-home Childcare Horoeka.&nbsp; These findings are included in this report to ensure that information about PORSE In-home Childcare Horoeka is transparent and widely available.</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Current Areas of National Interest</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is currently collecting information for national reports on:</p>
<ul>
<li>progress with self review; and</li>
<li>progress in meeting qualifications requirements and goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Progress with Self Review</h3>
<h4 class="HiddenReportText">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText">Self review is a process through which early childhood education services evaluate the effectiveness of what they do, with the aim of improving the quality of their practice and ultimately the outcomes for children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">ERO is currently investigating self review in early childhood services by seeking specific information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nature, extent and effectiveness of self review in the service;</li>
<li>the potential or actual contribution of self review to improved outcomes for children; and</li>
<li>the implications for improved early childhood service delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportBullet">The Ministry of Education is currently preparing guidelines for self-review in early childhood.&nbsp; When these guidelines are promulgated early childhood services will have further support for their self-review activities.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good practice</h4>
<ul>
<li>Self-review processes<br> PORSE national and the local network franchisee provides effective leadership through an agreed framework to guide management, the programme manager/tutor, educators and families.&nbsp; All participants easily understand the systems of the service.&nbsp; This structure is regularly reviewed to ensure that it achieves the stated purpose of the organization.&nbsp; Implementation of health and safety procedures is firmly in place.&nbsp; Self review processes contribute to the development of a quality service and support children&rsquo;s learning and growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for improvement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to further improvement<br> The franchisees and programme manager/tutor identify that although they work within a model of continuous improvement, they desire to strengthen this further.&nbsp; The focus for improvement should include continued professional development for nanny/educators using external providers, PORSE network resources and examples of best practice.&nbsp; ERO agrees with this goal for improvement.</li>
<li>Other matters<br> Some aspects identified during the course of the review should be addressed by PORSE managers.&nbsp; For information on these, refer to the PORSE management report</li>
</ul>
<h3>Progress in Meeting Qualification Requirements and Goals</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText">The requirements and goals for early childhood teacher qualifications and teacher registration were introduced to improve quality in early childhood education.&nbsp; ERO is currently investigating and reporting on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the qualifications and registration status of &lsquo;persons responsible&rsquo; in early childhood services and network coordinators in home-based care networks; and</li>
<li>progress in meeting the goal for 50 percent of regulated staff holding recognised qualifications and being registered teachers by 2007; and</li>
<li>the impact of the changes to qualifications and teacher registration on the quality of education and care provided.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="ReportBullet">Area of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportBullet">Qualifications and persons responsible requirements<br> The programme manager/tutor, who coordinates the curriculum, holds recognised qualifications and full teacher registration.&nbsp; Children and educators benefit from the improved understanding that the programme manager/tutor has about early childhood education.</p>
<a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE In-home Childcare Horoeka completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they have or have not attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s investigation identified no areas of concern.</p>
<a id="6-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Recommendations</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO and the service arranger agreed that:</p>
<p class="HiddenReportText" style="padding-left: 30px;">6.1 the franchisees and programme manager/tutor continue to work towards network improvement through ongoing external and internal professional development</p>
<a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>

<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Areas of Specific National Interest </b>&ndash; information about how National policies are working in early childhood services.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this home-based care service.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this home-based care service.<b></b></p></html>
