<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Sumner is located in the Sumner suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates on a sessional basis to provide care and education for 30 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>high quality interactions and teaching practices that encourage and extend children&rsquo;s independence, creativity and curiosity</li>
<li>the range of learning experiences which respond to children&rsquo;s interests and reflect and utilise the local environment and resources</li>
<li>the strong bicultural focus within the environment and programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers know the children, their families and the community well. They value and encourage families and wh&#257;nau to share their wh&#257;kakp&#257;p&#257;. Close links with the local schools support children&rsquo;s transitions from the kindergarten. The children regularly visit the local school to use the library and for important school events.</p><p align="left">The next step for the teachers is to review and further consolidate programme planning, assessment and self-review practices to increase their quality and usefulness of these processes.</p><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides clear policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergarten Sumner was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergarten Sumner.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s vision is to develop a community of learners where everyone is treated with respect. Teachers aim to encourage children to be critical, creative, self-directed learners.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Teachers, children and their families demonstrate caring and respectful relationships. Teachers know the children and families well. Children are cooperative and inclusive of each other. ERO observed children enjoying playing and learning together.</p><p align="left">Teachers foster strong links with the community. They make good use of local resources and encourage parents to share family histories and connections to the local area. They have positive relationships with the local schools and new entrant teachers. Children are well supported in transitioning to school.</p><h4>Teaching practices</h4><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s learning and development are well supported by high quality interactions with teachers. Parents and teachers have high expectations for learning and behaviour. Teachers use a good range of effective teaching strategies. They:</p><ul>
<li>use and model a wide vocabulary to support children&rsquo;s language development</li>
<li>positively manage children&rsquo;s behaviour</li>
<li>build on children&rsquo;s curiosity</li>
<li>focus on helping children to develop thinking skills.</li>
</ul><p align="left">These practices help build children&rsquo;s confidence in a calm learning environment.</p><p align="left">Teachers are involved alongside children&rsquo;s play. This has a positive impact on children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers actively listen and respond to children. Their planning is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and needs. Programme planning is clearly displayed for parents and their feedback is sought.</p><h4>Learning environment</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from a well presented and interesting learning environment. They are provided with a wide range of resources. Teachers make good use of the indoor and outdoor spaces to provide children with a variety of learning opportunities. The environment reflects the unique nature of the Sumner community.</p><p align="left">Bicultural perspectives are clearly evident and integrated into the environment. Teachers are committed to the use te reo M&#257;ori and include phrases and waiata appropriately within the programme.</p><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p align="left">Teachers regularly reflect on the programme and how well children are learning. The best examples clearly identify learning and are used to plan next steps. As a new teaching team the teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they now need to consolidate group planning and assessment across the team to ensure the best learning outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">While teachers use the association guidelines for self review, it is not clear what use is made of these findings. These findings could be more effectively used in planning centre developments.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this kindergarten understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and teachers have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this kindergarten works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">There are four M&#257;ori children attending this kindergarten whose parents/wh&#257;nau have identified them as M&#257;ori. Teachers demonstrate a high commitment to biculturalism.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">A strength of this centre is the positive and supportive links teachers make with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. They regularly discuss wh&#257;nau aspirations for their children. Teachers value M&#257;ori culture and are interested in and encourage children and their wh&#257;nau to share personal history and knowledge. Teachers also foster strong links to local M&#257;ori history and have shared this with the wider kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The association&rsquo;s recent development of &lsquo;Kidsfirst Wh&#257;nau&rsquo; - a wh&#257;nau-based approach for involving and engaging parents in kindergarten life and their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">As a result M&#257;ori children experience an environment where their culture is respected and they have a sense of belonging.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergarten Sumner completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergarten-sumner" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergarten Sumner</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergarten Sumner.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Sumner is located in the Sumner suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates on a sessional basis to provide care and education for 30 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>high quality interactions and teaching practices that encourage and extend children&rsquo;s independence, creativity and curiosity</li>
<li>the range of learning experiences which respond to children&rsquo;s interests and reflect and utilise the local environment and resources</li>
<li>the strong bicultural focus within the environment and programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers know the children, their families and the community well. They value and encourage families and wh&#257;nau to share their wh&#257;kakp&#257;p&#257;. Close links with the local schools support children&rsquo;s transitions from the kindergarten. The children regularly visit the local school to use the library and for important school events.</p><p align="left">The next step for the teachers is to review and further consolidate programme planning, assessment and self-review practices to increase their quality and usefulness of these processes.</p><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides clear policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
