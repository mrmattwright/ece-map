</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergarten Sumner is one of 62 kindergartens governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. All Kidsfirst Kindergartens share a common vision and values.</p><p>Children from two years old to school age can attend kindergarten for up to six hours a day during the four kindergarten terms. The kindergarten is located beside Sumner School and has a close relationship with the school.</p><p>Since the June 2011 ERO review, the kindergarten has made significant progress to meet the recommendations in the ERO report. Self review, child assessment and planning are now useful and provide good direction for learning and teaching. The bicultural dimension of the programme has also been significantly strengthened.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 18 kindergarten reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the strong learning partnerships established between the teachers and the families. Home and kindergarten learning are closely connected. Teachers actively seek parent aspirations, views and insights of their children as learners. They make effective use of this information to extend children‚Äôs learning and social confidence.</p><p>The children make significant contributions to the programme and their learning. Teachers attentively listen to children and ask appropriate questions to find out more about children‚Äôs interests. Teachers use this information to help children develop their higher-level thinking, reasoning and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Children work well together and are inclusive of all other children. A feature is the way older children include younger children in their play. The session structure and teacher practices successfully promote younger and older siblings playing together and children developing friendships across age groups.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are successfully woven into all aspects of the programme and kindergarten documents. Children are proud of New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage and willingly share their new knowledge with their families. Families from all nationalities work with the teachers to continue to strengthen the inclusion of the MƒÅori language and culture within the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Teachers are progressive in their thinking and focused on further improving their practices and learning outcomes for all children. Leadership is shared across the team and individual teacher strengths and interests are well used to benefit the children, families and wider community.</p><h4>The Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association</h4><p>All kindergartens in this cluster have spacious indoor and outdoor areas and are well resourced to meet the interests and learning needs of their children. In most of these kindergartens, environments and resources:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>encourage children‚Äôs critical thought, wonderment and inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide challenges, stimulation and social support for children, families and the wider communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote opportunities for children to learn about sustainable practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens provides significant support for priority learners and their families. Teachers in kindergartens with priority learners receive considerable extra training and funding to ensure the needs of these learners are well met.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens has a strong commitment to te ao MƒÅori (the MƒÅori world view) and ensuring that their Education Service Managers (ESMs) and teachers are competent and confident in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. In this cluster of kindergartens, a bicultural curriculum is in place and bicultural practices are highly evident. The contribution from parents of MƒÅori children is highly valued and MƒÅori children are well supported to achieve success as MƒÅori.</p><p>The association has a well-understood vision, and highly effective strategic and annual planning systems, policies and procedures. It has strong leadership and collaboration across all levels of the organisation.</p><p>There is a thorough and well-understood process of self review at all levels of Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The skills and knowledge of the CEO, board and senior leaders are regularly sought by other kindergarten associations and early childhood services nationally and internationally.</p><p>The highly experienced and skilled trustees bring a good range of expertise to support their decision making. They have a wide knowledge and understanding of Kidsfirst and are very focused on achieving their goals. Their priorities are strongly linked to providing high-quality learning and care for all children.</p><p>The strategic leadership team members have a good breadth and depth of knowledge across their various areas of expertise. They value each other‚Äôs contributions and use their wide range of knowledge and skills to ensure effective operation of the service.</p><p>The ESMs show a high level of commitment to Kidsfirst and the implementation of the Kidsfirst vision, policies and expectations. They successfully challenge and use each other's strengths to meet the goals of Kidsfirst for high-quality learning and teaching in each kindergarten.</p><p>Kidsfirst has a well-developed evaluation process that is effectively used to identify the strengths, progress and areas for further development in each of its kindergartens. This allows the ESMs to successfully monitor how well each kindergarten is providing high-quality outcomes for children.</p><p>High-quality professional development is closely aligned to leaders and teachers achieving the Kidsfirst vision and goals. In this cluster, this is most evident in the well-developed, understood and useful self-review processes, child assessment and planning practices and effective use of a range of technologies.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Kidsfirst Kindergartens‚Äô managers have identified, and ERO agrees that the key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to further align the existing appraisal process for ESMS, head teachers and teachers to recent developments in Kidsfirst Kindergartens' quality improvement programme ensuring it is consistently achieving its vision to provide high-quality learning and teaching for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to continue to review kindergarten practices and premises to make sure that they meet the changing needs of their communities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Sumner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Sumner will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>26 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
