</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lancaster Learning Centre, situated on Auckland's North Shore, provides full-day education and care for up to 35 children in a mixed age setting. The centre is privately owned and has been under the ownership of the same family for over 25 years. It is well respected within the local community and has a number of long-standing staff members.</p><p>The head teacher leads a team of three other qualified teachers, one teacher in training and three unqualified teachers. Their teaching philosophy is based on children leading their learning in a play based programme. Teachers value the provision of a learning environment strongly linked to the natural world. A strong belief in the value of positive and collaborative relationships with children, whƒÅnau and the wider community underpins their work.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report highlighted the relaxed pace of play that supported children's sustained engagement in the programme. Respectful, positive relationships with children enable teachers to deliver a responsive programme and extend their learning. These positive aspects of practice have been maintained.</p><p>Areas for continued development in the 2015 report included strategic, annual and programme planning, internal evaluation and bicultural practice. There has been good progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are very well settled in a spacious environment that encourages exploration. A widely varied and easily accessible range of learning resources supports sustained imaginative and creative play. Children are well supported in the context of their play to develop social competence.</p><p>Centre routines provide long periods of uninterrupted play. This allows children to explore and learn at their own pace. They play cooperatively with friends in small groups or comfortably explore on their own. The mixed age setting encourages tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Teachers enact the centre philosophy well. They build positive and collaborative relationships with children and their whƒÅnau. Effective teaching strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the provision of a well-resourced, interesting learning environment linked to children's interests that encourages them to explore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting children's engagement in a range of challenging physical activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encouraging children to be independent and to care for each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective modelling of language that promotes children's vocabulary, stimulates their imagination and promotes critical thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the provision of meaningful literacy learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Consistent staffing and caregiving for infants and toddlers supports the development of deeper relationships. Teachers know children's preferences and needs, and are responsive to their individual ways of communicating. Children of all ages are well supported to explore.</p><p>The environment is reflective of te ao MƒÅori. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori incidentally in conversations with children and include karakia and waiata in the programme. These opportunities support children's developing knowledge of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Leaders plan to continue to strengthen the centre's bicultural practices through whole team, in-house professional development.</p><p>Children's portfolios are a very good record of their individual learning journeys. Teachers are inclusive of parent aspirations in planning programmes for children. Learning stories show connectivity and the developing complexity of children's play and learning. Programme planning and evaluation could include more reflection on the role and effectiveness of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders have established a system for teacher appraisal and will continue to develop this in line with the expectations of the Education Council. Internal evaluation would be strengthened through the use of an evaluative question to lead the process. The strategic plan would be better utilised by aligning it to annual planning, internal evaluation and appraisal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have agreed their key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepening teachers' knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017 to support a review of current programme planning and evaluation systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring all required policies and procedures are in place.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lancaster Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lancaster Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>15 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
