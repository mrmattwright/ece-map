</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ponsonby Montessori Kindergarten in Grey Lynn, Auckland is a well established, privately owned kindergarten. It provides all-day care and education for up to 30 children from two to six years of age. The majority of children enrolled are New Zealand European/PƒÅkehƒÅ with small numbers who are MƒÅori and of other ethnic backgrounds. The kindergarten roll is full and has a long waiting list.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, the centre has new owners. Extensive self review, community consultation and support from a professional consultant have informed strategic and annual plans. The centre‚Äôs environment has been modified both inside and outside, with a new playground and play resources providing a large variety of learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The kindergarten is led and managed by the owners, assistant manager and teachers. Regular professional guidance and support is provided for teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy, developed in consultation with the community and staff, provides a sound foundation for the programme and teaching practices. The philosophy aims to foster children‚Äôs development as competent, adaptive, open-minded and responsible citizens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy and vision are well reflected in practice. The programme is based on the Montessori philosophy and is closely aligned to the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Positive, respectful interactions characterise the relationships in the kindergarten. Children, parents/whƒÅnau are warmly received and welcomed. These relationships promote children‚Äôs respect of others and themselves and foster their sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers use their knowledge of children and their families to engage children in meaningful conversations throughout the day. They talk freely with children, helping them develop their social skills, their language and their learning. Children engage in sustained collaborative play and show respect for one another while working in small groups. They are also taught how to deal with conflict and how to problem solve together. These strategies promote the development of children‚Äôs independence and self-management skills.</p><p>The well designed curriculum supports children‚Äôs overall development and learning. It provides them with extensive opportunities to investigate, initiate their own learning and be imaginative and creative. Children have daily opportunities to develop early skills in reading, writing and mathematics through integrated approaches. Equipment is available in small kete strategically positioned around the environment to provoke children‚Äôs mathematical conversations and learning. Teachers create projects with children around real life and science experiences. They provide opportunities for children to learn Spanish and engage in perceptual motor and music programmes.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a commitment to implementing a bicultural curriculum and a tutor /parent supports the use of te reo MƒÅori with children and teachers. The kindergarten acknowledges the place that MƒÅori have as tangata whenua and will continue to develop more in-depth knowledge of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori. They also plan to recognise and respond to children‚Äôs diverse cultural identities.</p><p>Records of children‚Äôs learning are visible in portfolios, displays and weekly newsletters. The portfolios are accessible for children and their whƒÅnau. There is very good information available for parents about the programme and their children‚Äôs learning. Children‚Äôs strengths and interests are identified and records show the complexity and deeper levels of their developing skills and dispositions. Parent feedback is also documented and acknowledged. These approaches help teachers to provide a comprehensive curriculum that is relevant for children and their families. Transition practices for supporting children‚Äôs transition into the kindergarten and to local schools are well developed.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from highly capable leadership and collaborative team work. Teachers work well together. Leaders and teachers participate in high quality and ongoing professional development to provide best practice in early childhood education. They make effective use of updated information and research. They reflect as a team and want to continue to deepen teacher‚Äôs inquiry into their individual practices. These approaches will enable staff to continue providing high quality care and education for children.</p><p>The manager and leadership team maintain knowledgeable and capable oversight of kindergarten operations. The policy framework and management planning are sound. Self review is rigorous, systematic and well documented. The manager and teachers undertake in-depth review focused on improvement at all levels of the kindergarten‚Äôs operations and invite parent contributions and feedback.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ponsonby Montessori Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ponsonby Montessori Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>19 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
