</table><p>Leigh Community Pre-School Inc¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leigh Community Pre-School Inc is a not-for-profit centre, governed by a committee consisting of staff members and parent/community representatives. It is licensed to provide for 28 children, including eight under two years of age. The roll includes a small group of MƒÅori children. Children play and learn in two learning areas, each with its own separate outdoor play area.</p><p>The centre's professional leader works with the administrator to manage day-to-day centre operations. Most of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Since the 2015 ERO report there have been several staff changes.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is being reviewed by the new staff team. It is guided by the principles of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and promotes respectful, trusting relationships with a focus on the individual child. The philosophy supports a child-led learning programme. Teachers promote engagement with the centre's unique coastal environment.</p><p>The professional leader and teachers have continued to build on the strengths outlined in the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers learn in a calm, inviting environment and teachers demonstrate a strong commitment to the care of babies. Routines are unhurried, and respectful care practices support the development of children's self-help skills and independence. Teachers talk with children about their play, skilfully fostering their language development through meaningful conversations.</p><p>Children are settled and engaged in their play and enjoy periods of uninterrupted play in an inclusive environment. They are confident, articulate learners and have many opportunities to make their own choices about their learning. Teachers treat children with respect. Interactions between teachers and children are warm, positive and nurturing.</p><p>Children's wellbeing and learning are central to decision making. Programmes are child-led, and interest based. The curriculum has a strong focus on the use of natural resources and learning about the local community. Parents contribute their knowledge and skills to the learning programme.</p><p>Children's curiosity is fostered, and they are encouraged to explore and learn at their own pace. Teachers support children's social competence and foster peaceful conflict resolution. Literacy, numeracy and science are woven into children's play experiences.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor learning environments are purposely designed and thoughtfully presented to invite children to play. Open-ended resources and activities are presented to encourage creativity and imaginative play, and to foster conversation and oral language development. The outdoor area incorporates inventive ways for children to explore the natural world. There are good opportunities for children of all ages to extend their physical skills.</p><p>Teachers weave bicultural practices and a respect for te ao MƒÅori through the programme. They naturally integrate te reo and waiata into daily practice. Good models in the centre help to build their confidence and capability. Teachers respond to families with diverse cultural backgrounds by encouraging them to share their language and cultures with the children.</p><p>Children's individual and group interests are regularly documented and shared with families. An electronic system for sharing children's learning enhances communication with parents and enables them to have a greater input into their children's learning.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are thoughtfully managed and based on the needs of each child and family. Teachers have built positive connections with the local school to support children's successful transition to school.</p><p>The centre leader has created a professional learning culture based on high expectations and continuous improvement. Teachers are encouraged to develop their individual strengths and capabilities. Self review processes have been established and are being refined and strengthened. Centre policies are being reviewed to ensure that they align with all licensing requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen the assessment of children's learning, programme planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging with professional development to increase teachers' understanding about and implementation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>linking the annual plan and philosophy to the centre's strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a robust appraisal process that aligns with Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leigh Community Pre-School Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the onsite visit, the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has addressed the following non-compliances:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the documentation of fire drills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk analysis and management systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staff appointments processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>23 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
