<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside is a newly established, purpose-built preschool located in the Rolleston township. The teaching team provides good quality care and education for children aged from two to five years old. The preschool has two separate, spacious, classrooms to cater for the varying needs of younger and older children. The centre is situated in the same building as Bright Beginnings Montessori Nursery.</p><p align="left">The teachers work well together to foster a sense of well-being and belonging for children. Teachers warmly welcome families and encourage and value parent involvement at the centre.</p><p align="left">The centre programme is an effective blend of Montessori philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Children enjoy a mix of structured and free play experiences.</p><p align="left">Other strengths of the centre include the:</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>positive relationships between teachers and children and amongst children</li>
<li>way teachers encourage children&rsquo;s participation in play and learning</li>
<li>strong focus on literacy, numeracy and social learning</li>
<li>well-managed routines and transitions</li>
<li>attractively presented learning areas that provide a good range of Montessori resources.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left">The principal and teaching team have made good progress in establishing a well-organised and calm learning environment. The principal has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to sustain and improve the service are to:</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>develop long term strategic and annual planning processes</li>
<li>improve self review</li>
<li>refine assessment and programme planning documentation.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBright Beginnings Montessori Brookside.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre philosophy is focused on the Montessori philosophy. The centre is currently reviewing its philosophy to better reflect current teaching practice which is a blend of Montessori and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p align="left">The mission statement notes that the centre aims to provide a well-resourced and structured environment that will bring out the intellectual, moral and cultural potential in the child, with a focus on literacy and numeracy.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Relationships</strong></p><p align="left">Children benefit from positive, caring and respectful relationships with their teachers. Teachers focus on children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. This supports children to play well alongside each other for sustained periods of time. Teachers communicate effectively with each other and work well together as a team.</p><p align="left">Teachers give priority to developing relationships with parents so they can be well involved in their children&rsquo;s learning and development. Parents are warmly welcomed and given good opportunities to be involved in all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s activities.</p><p align="left">The principal has established good links with local schools to support children when they move on to school.</p><p><strong>Interactions</strong></p><p align="left">Teachers use a good range of teaching strategies to encourage children&rsquo;s participation in play and learning. Teachers&rsquo; interactions are unhurried and respectful. They notice and respond well to children&rsquo;s interests and play, and affirm their efforts and successes. Teachers give children many opportunities to develop independence and self-help skills.</p><p align="left">The development of children&rsquo;s oral language is a focus for teachers. Teachers model good use of language and involve children in a range of language experiences that build on their confidence and self esteem. Teachers listen well to children and involve them effectively in social and learning conversations.</p><p align="left">Teachers encourage children to play cooperatively. They actively involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play and support social learning. Children are encouraged to support each other and to affirm and celebrate other children&rsquo;s individual efforts and successes.</p><p><strong>Programme</strong></p><p align="left">The centre programme provides a blend of Montessori philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Children enjoy a mix of structured and free play experiences with a good focus on numeracy and literacy. They also enjoy and participate well in musical activities including waiata.</p><p align="left">Children show sustained interest, participation and enjoyment in a wide range of activities in the indoor and outdoor areas. They have many opportunities to be involved in individual and group play.</p><p align="left">Children respond well to familiar and predictable routines. Transitions between activities are well managed.</p><p align="left">Parents are well informed about children&rsquo;s learning, progress and participation in the programme through regularly documented stories in well-presented profile books.</p><p><strong>Learning environment</strong></p><p align="left">Children settle well in a calm, well-managed environment. The centre is purpose-built. It provides very spacious, attractively presented learning areas that include a good range of Montessori learning resources. The preschool has two large classrooms to cater for the varying needs of younger and older children.</p><p align="left">Children have many opportunities to be actively involved in a wide range of physical activities both indoors and outdoors. They have easy access to the spacious outdoor areas. Development of the outside areas is almost completed.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The principal has identified, and ERO agrees, that a number of management and curriculum systems, to support the new centre, are yet to be fully developed. These include reviewing and developing:</p><p><strong>Management</strong></p><ul>
<li>the centre philosophy to better reflect current teaching practices</li>
<li>long term strategic and annual planning processes to better support staff to achieve the centre&rsquo;s philosophy</li>
<li>an appraisal process for all staff.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The centre would also benefit from professional development to improve management systems including self review.</p><p><strong>Self Review</strong></p><p align="left">The principal has identified the need to develop centre self review. Emphasis should be placed on developing a policy, processes and action plans for in-depth and spontaneous curriculum reviews.</p><p align="left">The principal also needs to continue the current review of policies and procedures, and develop a plan for ongoing regular review.</p><p><strong>Assessment</strong></p><p align="left">The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>identify in learning stories how teachers plan to extend on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>use learning stories to show how children&rsquo;s learning progresses over time.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Programme planning and evaluation</strong></p><p align="left">The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>use the outcomes of assessment to help plan the programme</li>
<li>identify in programme planning the teaching approaches that teachers could use to help children to achieve their learning outcomes</li>
<li>evaluate the impact that teaching approaches have on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2><p align="left">While the principal and teachers have made good progress in establishing the centre, it is too soon for ERO to fully evaluate whether the centre can successfully complete the development and implementation of systems for management and curriculum.</p><p align="left">ERO has requested a report after one year outlining progress in achieving the areas for review and development identified in the report.</p><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><p align="left">27 April 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

The teaching team provides good quality care and education for children aged from two to five years old. The preschool has two separate, spacious, classrooms to cater for the varying needs of younger and older children. The centre is situated in the same building as Bright Beginnings Montessori Nursery.</p><p align="left">The teachers work well together to foster a sense of well-being and belonging for children. Teachers warmly welcome families and encourage and value parent involvement at the centre.</p><p align="left">The centre programme is an effective blend of Montessori philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Children enjoy a mix of structured and free play experiences.</p><p align="left">Other strengths of the centre include the:</p><ul>
<li>positive relationships between teachers and children and amongst children</li>
<li>way teachers encourage children&rsquo;s participation in play and learning</li>
<li>strong focus on literacy, numeracy and social learning</li>
<li>well-managed routines and transitions</li>
<li>attractively presented learning areas that provide a good range of Montessori resources.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The principal and teaching team have made good progress in establishing a well-organised and calm learning environment. The principal has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to sustain and improve the service are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop long term strategic and annual planning processes</li>
<li>improve self review</li>
<li>refine assessment and programme planning documentation.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
