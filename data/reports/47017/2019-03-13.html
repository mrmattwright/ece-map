</table><p>Te Whare Whitinga o te Rā is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Whare Whitinga o te Rā is a new bilingual education and care service established in June 2016, to align to Te Roro o te Rangi Hapū education strategy. It is owned by Te Roro o te Rangi Hapū Trust and located on hapū land in Eastern Rotorua. The centre caters for tamariki from six months to school age in three age-based settings each led by a head teacher in a full-day programme. The centre manager provides overall professional and administrative leadership. The centre is licensed for 70 children including 20 under the age of two years. Its roll of 60 includes 59 Māori children, most of whom affiliate to Te Roro o te Rangi.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is to follow the aspirations of the trust, to see all tamariki engaged in whanaugngatanga, wairuatanga, manaakitanga, and kōtahitanga as the foundation principles of the early learning environment.</p><p>A board of governors sets policies and direction for the centre. Most pouako, are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a shared kaupapa of unconditional aroha. Pouako create a warm, welcoming environment. Partnerships with whānau demonstrate genuine interest and attitudes of acceptance. Interactions are positive and sensitive. Pouako take time to listen to children and foster their language development in te reo Māori, English and New Zealand sign language. Learning environments are well designed. Pouako pay careful attention to the display and accessibility of resources. There are many opportunities for children of all ages to make choices, set challenges and experience success.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are valued and trusted as capable learners. Pouako ensure they have freedom, time and space to move and explore the natural and physical world.</p><p>Centre governance and management effectively promotes positive learning outcomes for all children. The service acknowledges Māori as tangata whenua and is committed to treaty-based partnerships at all levels. Parents and whānau are consulted and have opportunities to have a voice and be involved in decisions that affect their children and centre development. The service philosophy, vision and goals strongly reflect the aspirations that hapū, parents and whānau have for tamariki. There is an appropriate range of policies to guide centre operations and practices. Policies and procedures are based on the principles of advocacy, equity and social justice, promoting equitable opportunities for participation in the service for tamariki and whānau and are regularly reviewed. The board of governors has accessed an external consultant to support governance and management to maintain a strong focus on continual improvement including strengthening internal evaluation.</p><p>Leadership effectively grows collective capability within the centre, promoting positive outcomes for children. Centre leaders show a strong commitment to the philosophy and vision. They have established a culture where children are central to decision making and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Leaders have established relationships based on respect, trust and reciprocity. They value te ao Māori creating opportunities for parents and whānau to participate in the life of the centre. Leaders and pouako are strong advocates for the rights of all children to participate and enjoy learning. They have formed productive partnerships with parents and external support agencies ensuring equitable opportunities for children with additional needs.</p><p>The curriculum is effectively designed to realise the intent of the services philosophy. Whanaugngatanga, wairuatanga, manaakitanga and kōtahitanga underpin responsive, reciprocal and respectful relationships and interactions between, tamariki, their whānau and pouako. Māori theories, philosophies, hapū history and stories are well understood by pouako enabling them to develop a culturally appropriate curriculum. Consideration to the implications of the revised early childhood curriculum <em>Te Whāriki</em> is needed to support pouako to further extend and refine the centre's local curriculum. Pouako use te reo Māori naturally, demonstrating good models of the language for children and less confident adults. Māori children have opportunities to participate as tangata whenua. They show pride and enjoyment in waiata, haka, pūrakau and karakia.</p><p>Assessment affirms children’s language, culture and identity. It supports Māori children to develop a strong identity as Māori, acknowledging and building on their intrinsic cultural heritage. There is a focus on dispositional learning that makes links to whakataukī and the characteristics of tupuna. Assessment includes multiple voices including whānau aspirations. Pouako make assessment records accessible to tamariki of all ages to allow them to revisit their learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre manager and pouako are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to build an understanding of internal evaluation to enable them to inquire into the effectiveness of their practice and resulting outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in professional learning and development to support them to understand and respond to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the current early childhood curriculum document.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Whare Whitinga o te Rā completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
