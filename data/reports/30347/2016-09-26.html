</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Waikato Scholars Educare is a privately-owned, all-day education and care centre. The centre caters for children from three months to school age and operates four aged-based areas. At the time of this ERO review, there were 40 children enrolled, 6 of whom are MƒÅori. The centre serves a diverse community from a wide geographical area.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to provide a quality environment, where teachers will ensure the educational needs of each child are nurtured and enhanced. Children are encouraged to foster their own learning and gain an understanding of the wider world.</p><p>Progress has been made in addressing the key next steps identified in the 2013 ERO review. A new head teacher has been appointed. Teachers have evaluated how they implement <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, in order to strengthen programme planning and assessment practices. The carpentry area has been redeveloped, along with part of the outside environment.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging are effectively fostered through the positive, caring and affirming relationships at all levels of the centre. They confidently interact with teachers, who are responsive to their interests, strengths and needs. Children are encouraged to develop a range of knowledge, skills and dispositions. They are well supported to develop as confident, competent learners.</p><p>Children are able to follow their interests through play-based learning. They experiment, explore and investigate in spacious and attractive environments. Children are actively engaged and have fun in their learning. They have ready access to the shared outdoor and other play areas. This promotes caring, respectful relationships between all age groups. Teachers are effectively fostering the social competence of children by encouraging them to solve their own problems and work cooperatively with others. As a result, children develop friendships and interact constructively with others.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and responsive to individual children. They work in partnership with parents of children with diverse needs to enhance their learning and enable them to fully participate in the centre programme. Teachers have participated in professional learning to strengthen bicultural practices. The integration of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori varies across the areas within the centre. Teachers acknowledge this as an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Teachers provide meaningful opportunities to extend children's learning. They use a range of strategies to respond to children's interests, including open-ended questioning and challenging children's thinking. Literacy and mathematics are integrated in significant contexts. Children enjoy investigating the world of natural science and sustainable practice. Their learning is further enriched through excursions, centre events and activities, funding raising for community organisations and visits from people of interest.</p><p>Babies learn and develop in a spacious, warm and caring environment. They enjoy many opportunities to interact and build strong attachments with teachers. Babies explore and make sense of the world around them as they experiment with movement, language and a variety of resources. Teachers are flexible and respond to the cues of the children. Regular conversations with parents and whƒÅnau provide teachers with vital information about children‚Äôs preferences and needs. Teachers provide consistency and continuity for babies in order to establish a secure foundation for their care and education.</p><p>Parents are well informed about children's learning and development through informal conversations and individual portfolios. Learning stories acknowledge children as capable learners. Teachers summarise children's learning each term, celebrating activities they have been involved in. During the term evaluation process assessment should be further strengthened to make the increasing complexity of children's learning over time more visible.</p><p>Processes used for transition between areas is supportive and responsive to individual children and their parent's needs. This allows time for children to become familiar with the new learning space. Teachers also focus on building children's social competencies, learning dispositions and self-care skills to support their transition to school. The daily programme for four year olds extends learning and thinking. It supports children to inquire into learning gained from the morning programme and their own experiences. The use of current research about early literacy and mathematics learning in the current self review process about transition should assist teachers to continue to implement best practice across the learning programme.</p><p>Extensive policies and procedures guide practice in the centre. Effective self review informs decision making and leads to improved outcomes for children. Teachers are well supported to enhance their practice through collaborative teamwork, personal goals and professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree priorities for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly align the centre's strategic plan to the philosophy statement and valued outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement policies and procedures to ensure all teachers' annual appraisals include the Practicing Teacher Criteria (PTCs) in line with Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Waikato Scholars Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Waikato Scholars Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>26 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
