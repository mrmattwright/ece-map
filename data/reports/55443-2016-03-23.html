</table><p>With significant support from Barnardos KidStart Childcare management, this service should be well placed to sustain and improve practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Wainuiomata Early Learning Centre is one of 23 childcare centres owned and operated by Barnardos New Zealand, a national provider of community services for children and families. It is licensed for 30 children, including five aged up to two years. Of the 34 children enrolled, 13 are MƒÅori and nine are from Pacific ethnic groups. Three of the five teachers are qualified and registered. Two are fluent speakers of Samoan language.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of respectful relationships, parents‚Äô contribution, valuing cultural identity, diversity and Te Tiriti o Waitangi in supporting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The November 2012 ERO report identified the need for: stronger integration of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the programme; improved support for children‚Äôs transition to primary school; professional support for teachers to implement an assessment process; prioritisation of centre goals; and development of understanding and use of self review for improvement. Some progress is evident.</p><p>Day-to-day responsibility for the management of the centre is the role of the head teacher. The regionally-based practice leader supports curriculum. An early learning manager, who has yet to be appointed, will have oversight of the operation of a cluster of Wellington centres, including this one. Responsibility for centre-based services is delegated to a national operations manager who reports to a general manager and the Barnardos board through the Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Since the 2012-2013 ERO reviews of Barnardos early learning centres, significant restructuring of the national organisation has been undertaken. In this service, there have been six staffing changes in the past two years, including the appointment of a new leader in 2015. The centre was relicensed in 2014 to include children aged up to two years.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of five reviews of Barnardos KidStart Childcare early learning centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are caring and respectful in their interactions with children. They work together well to ensure that children are settled and engaged. Key teachers support those new to the centre and up to two years of age. Children are enthusiastic, friendly and independent learners. A focus on strengthening the quality of teaching continues, including teachers‚Äô use of intentional strategies to support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The child-initiated programme promotes high levels of engagement. Children‚Äôs independence in self care and opportunities for decision making are effectively promoted. Literacy, mathematics and music are well integrated in the context of everyday happenings. Teachers agree, a stronger bicultural perspective is needed in the curriculum. Te Whare Barnardos is a practical framework that supports understanding and use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is suitably resourced for a range of learning experiences. The outdoor area continues to be developed to provide physically challenging tactile, open-ended activities. Opportunities for children to participate in science, construction and creative activities and to return to previouslychosen play experiences, should be better facilitated.</p><p>The head teacher agrees that the new approach to planning for learning is in the early stages of development. Further work is needed by teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>make learning plans more visible for children</li>
<li>strengthen the focus on individual children‚Äôs significant learning and show how their learning is extended by teachers over time</li>
<li>identify and plan to meet parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should evaluate the planned the programme from time to time to identify next development steps for group and individuals.</p><p>Inclusive practice is evident. The environment celebrates the diversity of the community. Families‚Äô cultures are valued and positive relationships developed between staff and parents. Teachers‚Äô efforts to communicate with parents in their home languages is supporting them to understand and take a more active role in their children‚Äôs learning. A strong connection with the Samoan community is valued and sustained. Children with identified learning needs receive appropriate support.</p><p>Provision for infants and toddlers requires further development. Professional learning opportunities for teachers have been sourced.</p><p>A flexible and inclusive approach supports children‚Äôs transitions into the service that is based on their and their families‚Äô needs. Next development steps for supporting children‚Äôs transition to primary school should include continuing to develop ways of sharing information about children‚Äôs learning with new entrant teachers.</p><p>The appraisal process is not yet providing effective support for teacher development and endorsement of satisfactory performance in meeting professional teaching requirements. Barnardos ‚ÄòGoals and Growth‚Äô system should be fully implemented. Improved appraisal and focused professional development for the head teacher and practice leader are required.</p><p>Understanding and use of internal evaluation continues to need development at centre and management level. Previous good practice has not been sustained.</p><p>Barnardos provides a range of carefully-considered operational and administrative support for the centre. This includes constructive visits and reports from the practice leader and quality assurance through the annual audit. Work is underway to strengthen the use of these tools for promoting improvements to teaching and learning.</p><p>Strategic initiatives at management level have recently been identified to support improved outcomes under the new operational framework. Identification of strategic goals and development plans at local and centre level should be a focus for management once the learning centre manager role is confirmed. Further work needs to be done to support understanding and embedding of Barnardos operational changes. Guidelines and policies, although comprehensive, continue to need updating to reflect new ways of working. In this centre, teachers‚Äô shared understanding about practice, roles and responsibilities needs strengthening to support cohesive teamwork. Positive initiatives are the review of the centre philosophy and targeted support for the new head teacher.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare management should provide focused professional support for teachers and leaders in this service:</p><ul>
<li>to strengthen bicultural curriculum and understanding and promotion of te ao MƒÅori</li>
<li>improve provision for children up to two years of age.</li>
</ul><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare management will develop an action plan for ERO that shows how it will address the key next steps to improve teaching and learning practices across this cluster of services, and include:</p><ul>
<li>developing the quality of teaching</li>
<li>implementing improvement-focused appraisal for all staff</li>
<li>ensuring quality assurance processes are consistent</li>
<li>strengthening assessment for learning practices</li>
<li>increasing the understanding and use of internal evaluation</li>
<li>improving the alignment between strategic planning at management level with centre operations.</li>
</ul><p>ERO will monitor progress made in relation to the action plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Wainuiomata Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance related to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement an ongoing process of self review that helps the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care.<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Wainuiomata Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
