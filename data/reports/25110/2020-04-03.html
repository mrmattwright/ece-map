</table><p>Tu Manu Ae Le Tu Logologo Aoga Amata requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The aoga amata needs support to strengthen governance and management, leadership capacity, the quality of the curriculum and internal evaluation. The board is required to address areas of non-compliance related to police vetting, children's physical safety, suitable staffing and evacuation procedures. Since the onsite review considerable work has been undertaken.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tu Manu Ae Le Tu Logologo Aoga Amata operates under the Papakura Pacific Island Presbyterian Church. The centre philosophy promotes total immersion in gagana mo aganu'u Samoa and Christian values.</p><p>The aoga is governed by a board of 10 church members. The board is currently being restructured with new church, community and parent representatives. The founding chairman is currently acting as board chair until a new church minister/board chair is appointed later this year.</p><p>The service provider/treasurer is employed as the assistant person responsible with oversight of financial management. The new supervisor was internally appointed in 2019. The board employs three qualified teachers, one of whom left the service the day after the review. Other staff include a trainee teacher, two teacher aides, a cook and a grounds person.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted that the board should seek external professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement self review and strategic planning to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' self review, curriculum, teaching and bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Insufficient progress has been made in these areas. Ongoing trustee and staff changes continue to hamper the aoga to sustain progress. The board, aoga leaders and teachers require external professional support to develop an ongoing culture of improvement.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report also noted that leaders should improve provision for children's health and safety, with staff training in the legislative requirements of the Children's Act 2014. While staff participated in some professional development, an ongoing programme of training has not been implemented.</p><p>The board was required to implement police vetting every three years for all staff who were not registered teachers. This remains an area of non-compliance. New areas of non-compliance in relation to children's physical safety, suitable staffing and evacuation procedures have been identified in this evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed and settle quickly at the start of the day. Teachers know children, their whƒÅnau and the community well. They are kind and caring with children.</p><p>The programme reflects the philosophy through aganu'u Samoa and Christian values. Regular opportunities during the day include lotu and singing of songs and hymns in Samoan and <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori</span>. Children enjoy these shared times, participate with enjoyment, particularly when these sessions include opportunities to dance.</p><p>An issue for promoting children's learning is the lack of educational resources. This makes it difficult for teachers to extend children's play and to provide interest and exploration. It also reduces the opportunities children have to engage in meaningful learning. Financial management requires improvement to enable teachers to update and upgrade the learning resources and environment.</p><p>The supervisor's work to date has included forming a supportive team and better documentation of the assessment and planning cycle. Planned professional development is focused on strengthening teachers' capability to evaluate the quality of the programme and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Induction and training for staff requires improvement. It is important that the board ensures teachers and leaders receive ongoing training to better manage the requirements of the 2008 Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services and <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>External support is required in order to clarify and increase trustees' understanding of their governance role. Policies and procedures need rationalising and updating, and a cycle of review is required to ensure that policies adequately guide teachers and leaders in their work. The strategic plan should be linked to the annual plan and budget. A new appraisal process has been developed but has not yet been fully implemented. Staff were not appraised in 2019. Systems of accountability require further development to manage potential for conflicts of interest.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and the leaders and board members agree, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>obtain support and guidance to improve governance and management procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the robustness of internal evaluation to inform teachers and parents about the impact of teaching on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue professional development to guide the delivery of a curriculum that is better informed by assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tu Manu Ae Le Tu Logologo Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to children's physical safety, suitable staffing and evacuation procedures. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>excursion procedures include detailed risk assessment management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staff appointment processes meet safety checking requirements, and all workers who have access to children are police vetted every three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a regular system of appraisal is implemented for all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fire, earthquake and lockdown procedures take place every three months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>furniture for children to sleep on is securely covered with non-porous material (that is, material that does not allow liquid to pass through)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sleep monitoring checks are accurately recorded and meet licensing requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicine records include parental acknowledgement when medication has been administered.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7,7A; HS8,9,17,28; PF30; Children's Act, 2014.</em></p><p>Since the onsite visit, the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has addressed the following non-compliances:</p><ul>
<li>safety checks, including police vetting for all staff, have been undertaken</li>
<li>risk assessment and other safety precautions around excursions are now in place</li>
<li>a timetable for appraisals is now in place, including a policy</li>
<li>a timetable for fire, earthquake and lockdown drills is in place and drills have been undertaken</li>
<li>non-porous covers on stretchers for children's sleep are now on all stretchers, and the sleep monitoring procedures have been updated</li>
<li>parents are now required to sign to acknowledge when medication has been administered.</li>
</ul><p>Therefore, these actions for compliance are no longer required.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 April 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
