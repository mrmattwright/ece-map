</table><p>Antarctica Early Learning School¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Antarctica Early Learning School, located in the Hamilton suburb of Fairfield, is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 42 children up to six years of age. The centre operates two aged-based rooms with shared outdoor spaces. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is a second language. At the time of this review, 42 children were enrolled, including 31 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Through the service's vision and philosophy teachers aim to develop relationships based on 'integrity, respect, nurture and trust'. They state that 'relationships underpin all learning between children, their whƒÅnau and teachers under MƒÅori principles of aroha, whanaungatanga and wƒÅnanga'.</p><p>Since the May 2016 ERO report, Antarctica Early Learning School has been under new ownership. The centre manager supported by an assistant manager oversees teaching practices. A newly appointed teaching team consists of qualified and unqualified staff. Teachers' diversity of cultural backgrounds reflects that of children and families in the centre. Leadership provides an overarching governance and management framework for enacting the strategic direction.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from reciprocal and responsive interactions with teachers. Relationships between families and teachers are affirming, respectful and highly valued. Parents contribute and participate in the centre programme on a regular basis. Literacy, mathematics and science are naturally woven throughout the programme. Teachers should now consider ways to add complexity and challenges for older learners through intentional teaching and planning.</p><p>Parents' views and aspirations for their children are responded to. Learning portfolios reflect children‚Äôs engagement in the life of the centre. Children with additional learning needs are well supported through ongoing individualised planning and external support. The centre's philosophy is strongly evident in teaching practice. Children enjoy learning in meaningful contexts.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to the strengths and interests of children. Families are welcomed by teachers into a peaceful, family-like environment. Tikanga MƒÅori is respectfully implemented through karakia kai, sharing waiata and learning about Papat≈´ƒÅnuku. The languages, cultures and identities of Pacific and other ethnic groups are highly prioritised in planning. Children up to the age of two years benefit from individualised routines and form secure attachments with familiar caring adults. Positive transitions into and out of the centre support children's confidence and sense of belonging. Children are empowered to take increasing responsibility for themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>Leaders base relationships on respect, trust and reciprocity. Emergent leadership amongst teachers is encouraged. There are opportunities for regular professional learning and development with ongoing mentoring and support for teachers. Leaders have developed clear guidelines and expectations for teaching practice and curriculum delivery.</p><p>Strong systems and processes guide centre operation. Internal evaluation is improvement focused and includes ongoing consultation with families and whƒÅnau. Leaders should evaluate the impact of intentional teaching strategies used, to ascertain how well these promote positive learning outcomes for children. There is clear alignment between the strategic direction and annual plans. The appraisal process supports teachers to strengthen their practice. A range of initiatives remove barriers to education and support wellness for children. The organisation's philosophy, vision and goals promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further refine and enhance internal evaluation processes to ensure they are more clearly focused on intentional teaching practices and outcomes for learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deliberately plan and implement learning experiences for older learners, in order to add more complexity to their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Antarctica Early Learning School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>27 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
