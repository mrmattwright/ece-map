<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Ascot Park Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children attending the kindergarten come from a range of cultural backgrounds, with 59% identifying as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Considerable emphasis is placed on partnership with wh&#257;nau. Parents are welcomed warmly and their involvement and contributions are valued and actively sought. These strategies help to make links with the children&rsquo;s home experiences. The concept of wh&#257;nau awhi is highly evident. A focus on te ao M&#257;ori is encouraged through displays and resources to support children&rsquo;s understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p>Relationships between children and teachers are positive, supportive and mutually respectful. Children are friendly and enjoy their time at the kindergarten. Children with special needs are well provided for through an inclusive approach and teachers work effectively with external support agencies.</p><p>The stimulating, well-resourced learning environment is carefully set up to encourage children to actively explore and engage with their surroundings. Good quality resources and equipment are organised to attract children&rsquo;s interest and regularly rearranged to maximise their use. Interesting wall displays celebrate the cultural backgrounds of families. A busy tone to sessions is evident.</p><p>Teachers provide a broad-based curriculum that fosters children&rsquo;s learning and development in authentic contexts. Games, books and puzzles promote the development of literacy and numeracy skills. Children are exploring simple science concepts and applying them to practical activities.</p><p>Areas for review and development include increasing teacher understanding of effective self review, explicitly documenting programme planning and extending children&rsquo;s engagement in sustained conversations.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Ascot Park Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAscot Park Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The teaching team comprises a head teacher and three teachers, one of whom is provisionally registered.</p><p>Environment upgrades include installation of acoustic walls, new vinyl and carpet, extension of the interior and additional storage sheds. Further development of the outdoor area is presently being undertaken.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><h4>Interactions</h4><p>Relationships between children and teachers are positive, highly supportive and mutually respectful.</p><ul>
<li>Teachers are attuned to children&rsquo;s interests and needs, and skilled at fostering and promoting their independence and friendships. Children readily approach adults who respond to them as capable and competent learners.</li>
<li>Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are valued and woven through the curriculum experiences children have. Teachers are genuinely committed to increasing their confidence in te reo M&#257;ori and all have attended external professional development. An appropriate focus on te ao M&#257;ori is encouraged through displays and resources that support children&rsquo;s understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</li>
<li>Emphasis is placed on partnership with wh&#257;nau, and their involvement and contributions are valued and actively sought. Extended family members are welcomed warmly and this reinforces links with the children&rsquo;s home experiences. The concept of wh&#257;nau awhi is highly evident.</li>
<li>Children with special needs, including those for whom English is a second language, are well provided for through an inclusive approach. Teachers work effectively with support personnel.</li>
<li>There is a well managed and comprehensive approach to develop children&rsquo;s confidence in moving to a primary school setting. Children visit the local school and teachers share dialogue with new entrant teachers about children&rsquo;s strengths and needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Learning Environment</h4><p>The stimulating, well-resourced learning environment is carefully set up and organised to encourage children to actively explore and engage with their surroundings. There is a busy tone to sessions.</p><ul>
<li>Generous work spaces allow for the thorough exploration of materials. There is an extensive range of good quality resources and equipment, including e-learning tools. The resources are organised to attract children&rsquo;s interest and regularly rearranged to maximise their use.</li>
<li>The outdoor area has been a recent focus for development and is a popular meeting place for children to engage in physical play, allowing safe opportunities for risk taking and gardening activities, including tending an edible garden. There is a strong emphasis on caring for the environment and the promotion of healthy eating choices.</li>
<li>Routines are well implemented and expectations for children&rsquo;s behaviour, clear and consistently applied.</li>
<li>Cultures are valued and celebrated. Interesting artefacts and wall displays reflect the cultural backgrounds of families and focus on encouraging parents to participate in the programme. There is an acknowledgement of the importance of working with the community to create suitable learning experiences.</li>
</ul><h4>Programme</h4><p>In keeping with their philosophy of providing an environment where children can learn through a variety of play experiences teachers provide a broad-based curriculum that fosters children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><ul>
<li>The engaging programme is designed around children&rsquo;s emerging interests and parents&rsquo; contributions and ideas. Each child is considered important and their potential nurtured.</li>
<li>Each child&rsquo;s experiences and learning is recorded in highly-valued and attractive profile books that children have ready access to. Teachers capture, identify and explain children&rsquo;s learning. Learning stories reflect both individual and group experiences and links between stories are evident.</li>
<li>Mat time discussions are used to interweave literacy and numeracy in authentic contexts. Games, books and puzzles help promote the development of literacy and mathematical skills. Children explore simple science concepts and apply them to practical activities.</li>
<li>Children listen well and confidently join in learning conversations skilfully facilitated by some teachers. These discussions enrich oral language skills and extend learning and thinking.</li>
<li>Imaginative and dramatic play is fostered particularly in the family corner and children have ample access to materials and equipment for creative activities.</li>
<li>Specific activities and excursions are planned to broaden and enrich children&rsquo;s experiences</li>
</ul><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><ul>
<li>
<p>Planned, methodical self review is in the early stages of development. Teachers need to develop a clearer understanding of how to use evidence-based self review as a basis for evaluation of kindergarten operations and programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>More visible, documented evidence of the planning process and how the rich information gathered is used would assist communication of the programme with all staff and parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff have identified that it is important to more effectively respond to parent aspirations for their children and continue to explore ways to increase their contributions in children&rsquo;s profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-depth assessment including the identification of extension possibilities for individuals and groups requires strengthening. This should be documented more explicitly and consistently in learning stories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While interactions are nurturing and encouraging, more frequent use of effective questioning techniques is likely to further enhance children&rsquo;s problem solving abilities and foster engagement in sustained dialogue.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Association Support</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>

</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

</table><p>8 May 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-ascot-park-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Ascot Park Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Ascot Park Kindergarten.</p><p>Ascot Park Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children attending the kindergarten come from a range of cultural backgrounds, with 59% identifying as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Considerable emphasis is placed on partnership with wh&#257;nau. Parents are welcomed warmly and their involvement and contributions are valued and actively sought. These strategies help to make links with the children&rsquo;s home experiences. The concept of wh&#257;nau awhi is highly evident. A focus on te ao M&#257;ori is encouraged through displays and resources to support children&rsquo;s understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p>Relationships between children and teachers are positive, supportive and mutually respectful. Children are friendly and enjoy their time at the kindergarten. Children with special needs are well provided for through an inclusive approach and teachers work effectively with external support agencies.</p><p>The stimulating, well-resourced learning environment is carefully set up to encourage children to actively explore and engage with their surroundings. Good quality resources and equipment are organised to attract children&rsquo;s interest and regularly rearranged to maximise their use. Interesting wall displays celebrate the cultural backgrounds of families. A busy tone to sessions is evident.</p><p>Teachers provide a broad-based curriculum that fosters children&rsquo;s learning and development in authentic contexts. Games, books and puzzles promote the development of literacy and numeracy skills. Children are exploring simple science concepts and applying them to practical activities.</p><p>Areas for review and development include increasing teacher understanding of effective self review, explicitly documenting programme planning and extending children&rsquo;s engagement in sustained conversations.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
