</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Mark‚Äôs Community Preschool is a community-based early childhood centre in Central Tokoroa. It is governed by a Charitable Trust, associated with the Presbyterian Church. It is licensed for 35 children of whom 10 are under two years old. A significant number of children are of MƒÅori and Pacific descent.</p><p>Since the September 2012 ERO review the new centre manager has restructured centre organisation and leadership. Two team leaders have been appointed in the over and under two year-old areas. In addition, there have been changes to staff and leadership of the under two‚Äôs. The centre leaders and trust committee have responded positively to the areas for review and development in the 2012 report.</p><p>Teachers have engaged in ongoing professional learning and development with external providers in assessment, curriculum, literacy and positive behaviour and guidance. This has resulted in growing capability in professional practice and improved outcomes for children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre culture is underpinned by the values and beliefs of the centre philosophy, which promotes children‚Äôs love of learning within a safe, caring and stimulating environment.</p><p>The committee is supporting the leadership in carrying out ongoing improvements to the physical indoor and outdoor areas. Children now learn and play in a bright, spacious and well-resourced environment that is responsive to the diverse needs and interests of children, and encourages social interaction and exploration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and settled within a positive culture for learning. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and independence. Children‚Äôs behaviours are positively managed by teachers who have developed a range of strategies to resolve conflict and build resilience. Children were observed playing independently and in groups for sustained periods of time. Teachers joined children in play at their level and supported their problem solving and experimentation. They provide children with feedback that acknowledges their efforts and success.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs daily programme has been changed to better meet the children‚Äôs interests and needs. Each day follows children‚Äôs natural rhythms, and transitions are managed sensitively by teachers. Children are encouraged to lead their own learning, sometimes in the role as teacher.</p><p>The under two‚Äôs section is well led by an experienced team leader. Loving and caring relationships with babies and toddlers were observed. Care routines are sensitively managed through respectful and unhurried practices, and these are predictable for babies. Learning is meaningful because children are directing and driving their own care routines and learning.</p><p>Teachers are constantly modelling good quality oral language. As toddlers grow they are encouraged to make their wishes known through verbal and non-verbal communication, and learn self-managing skills.</p><p>A rich curriculum is provided for children of all ages. Teachers plan a diverse range of high quality learning opportunities and activities for children to participate in. They contribute a variety of knowledge, skills and experience to curriculum and programme planning. Children benefit from good quality, authentic resources, and learning relationships that promote inquiry, exploration and open-ended investigations. Priority is placed on learning through science, sustainability, creativity, literacy, storytelling, construction, puzzles, imaginative play and developing fine and gross motor skills. Teachers could now explore ways to further extend and challenge older children and those with special talents and abilities.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes have been strengthened in response to the 2012 ERO review. Children‚Äôs learning is observed and recorded by teachers in good quality learning stories. This assessment information is used to plan and share ideas for future learning. Children‚Äôs learning is also displayed on the centre walls so that they and their parents can revisit their activities and play.</p><p>There is a willingness and commitment to strengthening bicultural perspectives throughout the programme. The centre is in the very early stages of this development. Staff have begun to develop a range of strategies that promote MƒÅori perspectives within aspects of the programme, and by using the concepts of <em>Te Whatu Pokeka</em> in the writing of learning stories. The inclusion of a bicultural component in the programme continues to be an ongoing priority for centre leaders and staff.</p><p>The leadership team is promoting a greater focus on teaching and learning and building professional capability. Leaders are strongly committed to the child's wellbeing and educational development. A prominent focus has been the strengthening of relationships with parents and whƒÅnau as mentioned in the strategic plan and self-review documentation. A range of successful processes is used to encourage participation by whƒÅnau in centre activities.</p><p>The centre manager, with the support of team leaders, is taking a deliberate and careful approach to the management of centre change. They are enacting and realising the centre's philosophy and strategic priorities. The team has succeeded in establishing a calm, supportive centre culture in which children are encouraged to lead their learning and play.</p><p>The trust committee is led by a knowledgeable and supportive chairperson who provides the centre manager and team leaders with sound advice and guidance. The trust committee is focused on improving outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau. The centre has adopted a planned approach to self review that includes a regular cycle of policy review, annual planning and financial management. Staff are in the process of reviewing their strategic priorities for the next three years and this should involve a consultative process with parents, teachers and community. As part of this process, the centre manager has identified the need to review the centre philosophy to more closely reflect present and future priorities and beliefs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre manager and leaders agree that important next steps for ongoing development and improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>further responding to children‚Äôs language, culture and identity in a more planned and deliberate way</li>
<li>deepening reflection and evaluation to include current research and theory in early childhood education</li>
<li>more closely aligning strategic and annual planning with the centre philosophy.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Marks Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Marks Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
