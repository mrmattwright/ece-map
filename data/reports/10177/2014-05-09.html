</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Trinity Kindergarten is located in the grounds of the Trinity Methodist Church in Pakuranga, Auckland. The centre provides education and care for children between approximately two and a half to five years of age. Older children attend three days a week and a younger group attends twice a week. This review was informed by observations of a session that caters for children up to three and a half years of age.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Howick Pakuranga Methodist Early Childhood Trust which includes church representatives, parents, community members and the head teacher. The centre has recently undergone a period of change. In the past year, governance and management systems have been restructured. Trustees and teachers continue to implement new frameworks to guide centre operations.</p><p>Daily management of the centre is delegated to the head teacher. All of the teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report identified that the good practices noted in previous reports had been sustained. ERO suggested that teachers further develop self-review systems and curriculum processes. The current teaching team recognises that these remain priority areas for continued improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children make choices for themselves and enthusiastically participate in a variety of experiences and learning opportunities. They are settled and focused, both in solitary play and in social activities alongside other children. Children communicate confidently with teachers and have a good understanding of routines.</p><p>Teachers interact with toddlers and older children in caring and affirming ways. They provide children with individualised care and attention in a nurturing environment that promotes wellbeing and belonging. The centre philosophy is highly evident in teaching practices, with respectful and responsive interactions being a feature of the programme.</p><p>The spacious indoor and outdoor environments are attractively and thoughtfully presented. Toddlers and older children choose from a wide range of resources that support their investigation and inquiry. The recently upgraded outdoor environment provides all children with physical challenge and opportunities for further exploration and discovery.</p><p>Teachers respond to children‚Äôs interests and encourage their involvement in the programme. Children‚Äôs individual learning records show their participation in learning experiences. Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that improving the quality of programme planning, assessment and evaluation is a priority area for development. Work in this area could support teachers to plan for learning and to record children‚Äôs progress over time.</p><p>Families express a high level of satisfaction with the centre. They appreciate the reciprocal and trusting relationships that they and their children have with teachers. Regular sharing of information about children and formal parent/teacher discussions contribute to shared understandings and positive outcomes for all children, including MƒÅori and Pacific learners.</p><p>Leadership is effective. The head teacher is focused on improvement and works collaboratively with teachers. The reflective teaching team is continuing to build upon valued ways of working together. The centre‚Äôs newly developed teacher appraisal system is likely to support teachers to enhance their current good practices.</p><p>Governance and leadership responsibilities are clearly defined. The participation of trustees and teachers in professional development has guided an effective restructure and redevelopment of management systems and frameworks. Long-term and annual goals are being developed. It is now timely for trustees and teachers to strengthen self-review practices to guide ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and teachers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>team participation in targeted, in-depth professional development to improve the quality of programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>embedding newly established teacher appraisal systems to enhance teacher practices</li>
<li>strengthening trustee and teacher understanding and use of self review to inform ongoing improvement</li>
<li>finalising annual and long-term goals to support the future direction of the centre and further improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that teachers participate in targeted and in-depth professional development to improve and update programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Trinity Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Trinity Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>9 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>

The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
