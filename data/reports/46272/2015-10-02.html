</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coast Montessori Preschool is located in the township of Silverdale, North Auckland. The centre is licensed to provide sessional and full day education and care for 45 children from two years to school age.</p><p>Coast Montessori Preschool follows the principles and practices of the Montessori philosophy, as well as those outlined in <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre’s philosophy has an emphasis on promoting the uniqueness of the individual child and on children learning and exploring in a safe and child-orientated environment.</p><p>Coast Montessori Preschool is privately owned. The two owners have management and teaching roles and operate the centre together. They are supported by a head teacher and a teaching team of mostly registered and qualified teachers.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre, which has been operating since 2013. Since opening, the owners and head teacher have continued to develop relationships with families and the community. Resourcing the environment has been a key priority.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families benefit from an environment that is welcoming and inclusive and promotes a strong sense of belonging. Children experience close and trusting relationships with teachers and develop good friendships with their peers. The focus on building and sustaining relationships with families is a feature of the preschool.</p><p>Children are familiar with the centre’s clear routines and play both independently and in groups. They have easy access to resources and specialised Montessori equipment in a spacious and well organised environment. The outdoor space is well designed and offers a variety of activities and equipment to promote children’s learning. The daily outdoor programme provides children with the opportunity to follow their own interests.</p><p>Teachers know children well and are caring and supportive of their exploration and learning. Teachers focus on one-to-one interactions with children. They sensitively build children’s capability in literacy and numeracy. Teachers could consider further teaching strategies to continue to build on children’s thinking and creativity.</p><p>Teachers include te reo Māori through greetings, waiata, stories and numeracy. The owners and the head teacher acknowledge their need to continue strengthening bicultural practices. They agree that making use of <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, would support this next step.</p><p>The preschool continues to develop links with local schools. These relationships support children in their transition to school. Children with special education needs are also well supported as they move within the preschool, and on to local schools.</p><p>Information shared by parents is appreciated and used to build teacher’s knowledge of children’s learning and their relationships with children and their families. Parents’ value access to the interactive electronic portfolios that show their child’s learning journey.</p><p>Teachers take detailed notes about how children spend their time, and their learning progress. They use this assessment information to guide children to the next task in the area of the Montessori curriculum. The owners and the head teacher are continuing to refine their planning, assessment and evaluation practices so that teachers meet the individual needs and interests of each child.</p><p>The owners and teachers work collaboratively and leadership is shared for the day-to-day running of the preschool. Ongoing self review is well documented and used to continually improve the quality of learning programmes, and the systems that guide the operation of the preschool. Teachers are encouraged to participate in professional development and to continue with personal study. The appraisal system is used to identify individual teacher’s goals and their professional learning needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with centre owners and the head teacher that the key next steps for preschool improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>formally document strategic and annual planning to guide the future direction of the preschool and to help ensure the preschool’s philosophy and vision are aligned and evident in preschool practice</li>
<li>strengthen teachers’ understanding and skill in using te reo and tikanga Maōri, and include this expectation in teacher appraisal</li>
<li>provide external professional development to further strengthen the leadership skills of teachers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coast Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coast Montessori Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>2 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
