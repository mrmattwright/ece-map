</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bell St Early Learning Centre Martinborough is privately owned. The co-owners also operate Bell Street Early Learning Centre in Featherston. The teacher-led full-day centre caters for a diverse range of families from South Wairarapa.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 22 children, including ten up to two years of age. The centre is organised as a mixed-age setting. The current roll of 41 includes 12 who identify as Māori. The centre has close links with Ngāti Kahungungu Ki Wairarapa.</p><p>Since opening in 2015, the owners have carefully established a small size sustainable centre in line with the stated philosophy. A key element of the centre's philosophy is to provide a warm, happy, homely environment. The converted bungalow style home supports this.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy is evident in practice. A settled homelike, happy atmosphere permeates. Routines, good communication and well-considered policies and procedures have enabled children, teachers, parents and whānau to develop a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers respond positively to children's individual needs. Children are confident with the well-established routines. As a result they are becoming capable, confident and active learners.</p><p>The curriculum is child centred and play based. Children are able to choose from a range of activities. The mixed-age approach enables young children to learn from older ones and they participate happily in the programme. There are quiet spaces for infants and toddlers to play independently. Teachers naturally weave numeracy and language, including te reo Māori, into the programme. They support risk taking and problem solving.</p><p>The learning environment is spacious and well organised. Children are able to access resources to investigate their interests and ideas. Resources are being built up over time. The outdoor environment supports and encourages physical activity and provides physical challenges.</p><p>Teachers know children well. Warm, purposeful, affirming interactions support children's social development. Teachers are responsive and work alongside children engaging in their play. Children enjoy opportunities to be involved in social interactions and conversations with their teachers and other children.</p><p>The next step for some teachers is to extend children's thinking by sustaining and engaging children in learning conversations. Cooperation is well modelled to children, who work and play cheerfully with each other for sustained periods of time.</p><p>The centre has a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The centre participates in the Ministry of Education Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) programme. Teachers learn from the specialist teacher ways to promote educational success for Māori children.</p><p>Some children who enrolled when the centre opened are nearing school age. The centre is developing a programme to support their transition.</p><p>The centre is well led. The owners are actively involved and supported by an assistant supervisor. An appropriate appraisal system builds professional practice.</p><p>Communication is good. Parents and whānau have many opportunities to learn about the programme and their child’s progress. The electronic profiles inform parents of the range of their child’s activities. The next step to improve assessment practices is for teachers to make closer links between the parents’ aspirations and the child’s progress towards meeting them.</p><p>There is a culture of ongoing improvement. Teachers reflect on the programme. They assess against the planned learning outcomes. The supervisor has begun to develop a structure for self review focused on improving outcomes for children. Once better established this should shift to internal evaluation. This would better support the centre to determine the effectiveness of the implementation of the curriculum and the strategic plan and promote improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and ERO agree that the key next steps for ongoing improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to provide appropriate resources that meet the range of ages and stages of development for children attending the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make better use of expressed parent aspirations in children's electronic profiles to better meet individual interests and improve assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build internal evaluation processes so that managers and staff can systematically and rigorously evaluate programmes, practices and operations. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bell St Early Learning Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bell St Early Learning Centre Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
