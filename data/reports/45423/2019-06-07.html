</table><p>Kereru Kindy¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kereru Kindy is a small service in central Wellsford. This is the first review of the centre following extensive renovations and re-licensing in 2018. It now provides an all-day education and care service for up to 30 children, including a maximum of five children aged under two years. Approximately 27 percent of the children currently enrolled are of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is summarised in the whakataukƒ´, "Manaaki whenua, Manaaki tangata, Haere whakamua / Care for the land, Care for the people, Go forward". The centre has strong intergenerational connections within the local community and has established relationships with local schools.</p><p>The centre owners, the manager and most teachers are longstanding in their roles. Owners invest in external professional advisors to support staff development. ERO's 2015 report identified several next steps relating to self review, personnel policies and procedures, and the layout and resourcing of the centre. These aspects have been addressed in part and continue to require improvement. Refurbishment and renovation in 2018 resulted in a designated area for children aged under two years.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's wellbeing is fostered by trusting and respectful relationships. Teachers show care for the welfare of children and families, who are welcomed into a home-like environment. Children have confidence and a strong sense of belonging as they play and explore the centre at their pace.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and value tamariki and whƒÅnau MƒÅori, as tangata whenua. The strategic plan identifies a deliberate goal to increase teachers' understanding of bicultural practices through inquiry and professional development. It should actively involve whƒÅnau in future planned reviews.</p><p>Children's interests generally guide the flow of play. Teachers plan group projects, themes and events as a team. They use a digital platform to share photos and stories about children's activities with parents. Children access their portfolios to reflect on their experiences. Teachers could improve these assessment records to clearly show how they plan to extend each child's learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are supported by a warm and respectful teaching team. Positive relationships foster children's confidence and self-esteem. These youngest children are able to mix with older peers at various times during the day. Routines are informed by parent aspirations and preferences.</p><p>Teachers supervising the play of children aged over two, allow them to problem-solve and explore without adult intervention. This is a change in approach, prompted by internal professional development. It is timely now to formally review the impact of this change in interactions to determine how effectively teaching promotes and extends learning.</p><p>Children enjoy having a spacious area outside to play freely. Leaders acknowledge that it would benefit from refurbishment and extra resources, as noted in ERO's 2015 review. They should evaluate the quality of the environment to promote a richer variety of learning opportunities.</p><p>The service has good connections with local schools, aiming to support coherent transitions for older children that promote successful future learning. Over time, teachers have introduced aspects of the programme to teach specific school-readiness skills. They continue to review and adapt these experiences to align more closely with the centre's child-led, play-based philosophy.</p><p>The teaching team considers ways to enhance teaching practices, supported by improved teacher appraisal processes. It is timely to now evaluate the quality of the centre's curriculum, teaching and learning, in relation to the requirements of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the revised early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Strategic planning has been improved. The manager now needs to develop purposeful actions with clear roles and responsibilities to enable staff to work toward strategic goals. There is an urgent need to strengthen leadership capacity to develop team capability and consistency, and to improve outcomes for children in a more deliberate and purposeful way.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre owners agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enhancing leadership capability through external professional development and mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the quality of the centre programmes and teaching practices in relation to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resourcing and enhancing the outdoor environment, informed by in-depth internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consulting purposefully with parents and whƒÅnau to improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kereru Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the manager needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen systems to mitigate and respond to hazards encountered during excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. The service provider must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish a schedule for reviewing all aspects of centre operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that thorough safety checks are undertaken before staff are employed.</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
