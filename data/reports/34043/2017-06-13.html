</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paddingtons Rimu Street, is located in the suburb of Maeroa, Hamilton. It is an all-day education and care service licensed for 27 children over two years of age. The service has changed ownership since the last ERO review in 2014. It is now one of many early childhood education facilities owned and operated by the private company, Evolve Group Limited.</p><p>Positive findings from 2014 ERO review continue to be evident. The centre manager and the majority of centre staff are qualified teachers and long-serving. Developments since 2014 include adopting a cluster support network between centre managers from the Evolve Group and introducing on-line child assessment portfolios. In addition an up-dated appraisal system has been implemented to meet the revised requirements of the New Zealand Education Council.</p><p>The centre has experienced changes in management. Evolve's area manager is new to her role and is working collaboratively with the centre manager to review and implement expectations and practice. Evolve is currently in the process of evaluating its guidelines for centre practice, with a focus on further developing strategic and internal evaluation processes.</p><p>The philosophy has recently been reviewed in consultation with families. It documents the aims to 'provide an environment that supports children to be independent thinkers and problem solvers. Together with parents provide a safe, happy homelike environment that empowers children to develop as capable and confident learners'.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre where teachers have created a friendly, inclusive home-like environment. Teachers have successfully established trusting, respectful and supportive relationships with children and their families. Children's transitions into the centre are sensitively managed. Teachers ensure a personalised approach to supporting the needs of each child. Positive relationships across the centre promote children's sense of belonging and wellbeing, and helps them to experience success in learning.</p><p>Teachers understand the importance of working in partnership with children's families. They are responsive to children's holistic development and make meaningful connections to children's life experiences to support learning. Many parents feel comfortable to stay, contribute and participate in children's learning. Individual assessment portfolios provide a rich record of children's engagement in learning, and capture their learning within the context of their play and exploration. Portfolios are also available for families on the internet, enabling extended family to be involved in, and informed about children's learning.</p><p>Teachers model values of whanaungatanga and use basic te reo Māori. They have prioritised te reo and tikanga Māori as a strategic goal for ongoing development for teachers' professional learning. Relationships strongly support Māori children's participation and promote whānau partnerships. Teachers have identified the need to strengthen the visibility of Māori language, culture and identity within documented assessments.</p><p>Multi-culturalism is embraced by teachers. Children and their families for whom English is their second language appreciate the way teachers have worked with them to find out about their culture and language, and explore effective ways for communicating and sharing information. Parents are invited to share cultural traditions, music and what is important to them as a family. Children in the centre are learning to appreciate and understand the cultural identity of their peers.</p><p>Children have fun and enjoy an environment that caters for a variety of diverse interests. They are empowered to lead their own learning through active exploration and investigation. Children are viewed by teachers as capable. They confidently set their own challenges for learning within a social setting alongside their peers. Literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas are well integrated through children's play. Teachers plan additional experiences for older children with fun, games and experiences to further extend their thinking and learning, as well as support children's transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children's learning. They skilfully extend children's learning through intentional teaching strategies, encouraging children to reflect on prior knowledge, think creatively, and use their imagination. New concepts are introduced through children's interests, and teachers extend learning by encouraging children to inquire and seek meaning. Children are well supported to develop as capable and confident learners.</p><p>Centre leadership works collaboratively with Evolve management and service leaders. Regular meetings support a professional learning culture where teachers reflect on practice, and discuss how centre systems can contribute to positive outcomes for children. Internal evaluation processes include spontaneous and planned reviews of the learning programme and centre operations. The area manager is working collaboratively with teachers to further strengthen programme assessment, planning and evaluation practices. These processes are effective contributing to the centre's ability to sustain effective practices that result in ongoing development and improvement for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre manager agree that key next steps are for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Evolve management to improve procedures and guidelines for internal evaluation, assessment, and programme planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers to consolidate strategic internal evaluation practices that enable them to continually improve their effectiveness in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paddingtons Rimu Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Paddingtons Rimu Street will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>13 June 2017 </p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"></a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
