</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Colwill Kindergarten provides high quality education and care. Children experience respectful, positive relationships within an inclusive and stimulating environment. Families attending come from a diverse range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds and can choose to send their children for half-day sessions or for school day hours.</p><p>A well qualified teaching team work cohesively to provide a well considered programme for children. Teachers continually review the environment to promote high quality outcomes for children. The kindergarten‚Äôs commitment to environmental sustainability is evident.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy aims to foster children‚Äôs curiosity and enquiry, and to nurture their wellbeing and sense of belonging. The celebration of children‚Äôs cultures and experiences has helped teachers, whƒÅnau and children understand each other better.</p><p>Staff have positive connections with the wider community. Regular meetings with leaders at the local kohanga reo, a Samoan pre-school and a refugee centre have enriched the kindergarten's cultural celebrations. These good relationships are enabling the kindergarten to further develop its bicultural curriculum and to strengthen the capacity of teachers to cater more effectively for the multi-ethnic community. Teachers work closely with families needing support to ensure that all children receive a good quality education.</p><p>Colwill Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide a high quality, child-led programme. The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers have a deep commitment to being inclusive of all learners and to promoting a bicultural curriculum. Respectful relationships are central to the kindergarten‚Äôs approach to providing positive outcomes for children. Teachers affirm and build on the strengths children bring. Children‚Äôs language, culture and identity are valued and promoted in the kindergarten.</p><p>Children make choices about their play in a vibrant and well resourced environment. They have a strong sense of belonging in their kindergarten and are enthusiastic about sharing their ideas. They trust adults and play well together. They have very good opportunities to explore and be physically active in the spacious outdoor area. Children engage in creative and imaginative play and have many opportunities to experience art, dance, and musical activities.</p><p>Teachers value and use parent information, ideas and support to help children become confident, capable learners. Teachers work as a high performing, cohesive team. Children have good opportunities to explore and experience literacy, numeracy, and science in meaningful ways. Children‚Äôs portfolios are highly valued, by teachers, children and families and show the development of children‚Äôs interests. Children living close to school are very well supported as they move on to start school.</p><p>Self review is relevant, child focused, and used to bring about improvement. Clear strategic goals, which align to the kindergarten‚Äôs vision statement and centre philosophy, are clearly outlined in annual plans. Teachers‚Äô performance appraisals promote high quality teaching practice and leadership opportunities. Teachers are now keen to receive and gather parent and whƒÅnau feedback to help further improve teaching and learning.</p><p>The head teacher provides strong professional leadership. Positive working relationships contribute to the centre‚Äôs culture of trust and respect. Teachers model good practice for teachers from the wider network of early childhood professionals. There are effective systems and a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association has good systems for self review and accountability to guide kindergarten management, and it continues to provide effective governance for kindergartens. The AKA has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to implementing strategies that support kindergartens in promoting positive outcomes for all children. The association is currently reviewing the appraisal process used in all of its kindergartens.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that next steps for teachers include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance the kindergarten‚Äôs focus on building its bicultural focus</li>
<li>embed the centre‚Äôs sustainable practices in its Enviroschools journey</li>
<li>promote information computer technologies to further strengthen the programme provided for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Colwill Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Colwill Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
