</table><p>Glamorgan Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glamorgan Kindergarten is one of 15 early childhood services operating under the umbrella of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association (the association) now trading as <span lang="mi">Kaitiaki</span> Kindergartens. The service is licensed for 40 children aged over two years and serves a diverse ethnic community. Many families have English as a second language. Daily six-hour sessions are for a mixed-age group of children from three to five years.</p><p>A governing board sets strategic directions for the association. Management of the association‚Äôs affairs is the responsibility of the general manager (GM). Two professional practice leaders (PPL's) have oversight of teaching and learning, compliance and policy development, and leadership. Day-to-day operation in this kindergarten is the responsibility of the head teacher who leads a team of four registered teachers.</p><p>Since the June 2015 ERO report, there has been turnover of personnel at management and senior leadership levels. Some of the teachers have been employed in that time.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning teaching and learning emphasises the importance of providing a welcoming, safe and challenging environment, equitable learning opportunities, empowerment, celebrating diversity and the Treaty of Waitangi. The natural environment and sustainable practices are high priorities for ongoing development, teaching and learning. The kindergarten has been awarded bronze 'Enviroschool' status.</p><p>The previous ERO evaluation findings were to strengthen partnerships with whƒÅnau, cultural responsiveness and evaluation. Progress is evident in these areas.</p><p>This review was one of nine in the Northern Auckland Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming, inclusive and respectful. <span lang="mi">Manaakitanga</span> is well established. The strong focus on children's wellbeing is supported by positive guidance and intentional teaching about mindfulness, resilience and care for others.</p><p>The learning environment is well developed. Areas of play and work spaces are richly resourced and carefully organised to invite children's participation. The outdoor area is challenging and interesting, and is designed to promote understanding of, and respect for, the natural environment.</p><p>The curriculum is mostly child driven, with teachers setting up provocations to promote interest and new ideas. Literacy, mathematics, nature and science, and the arts are all integrated into the programme in meaningful ways. Many children sustain their play for extended periods and show independence as learners.</p><p>Teachers value parents' input into their children's learning programme. A range of information, including some translated documents, is provided to assist families to settle in, and inform them of daily happenings and events. Children's transitions into the kindergarten are flexible and aligned to each family's needs. Teachers continue to work on strengthening relationships with families to contribute to a shared approach to planning for their children's learning.</p><p>Commitment to, and acknowledgment of, the importance of bicultural practice is highly evident and strongly led. Teachers have sought authentic learning opportunities with MƒÅori to support their approach. Children are knowledgeable about aspects of te ao MƒÅori and are active participants in <span lang="mi">tikanga</span> MƒÅori, including <span lang="mi">kapa haka.</span></p><p>Teachers' two-year inquiry into the transition-to-school process has resulted in improved outcomes for children and their families. These have included reciprocal visits with the local school and some sharing of information about children. Teachers should continue to seek ways to support the continuity of children's learning during their transition to school.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well provided for. Cultural diversity is celebrated. Multilingual teachers provide good support for many of the children for whom English is a second language. Appropriate assistance is accessed for others with identified needs. Continuing to build connections with the wider community to support the further development of their approach, particularly in relation to Pacific learners, is a team focus.</p><p>The team has improved aspects of planning. A new on-line program has resulted in more frequent communication with parents about their children's learning. Teachers are regularly noting special aspects of children's participation at kindergarten and linking these to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They now need to strengthen their approach by recording how children's strengths and emerging ideas are progressed over time.</p><p>Developing a cohesive teaching team is a strategic priority. Shared leadership is encouraged and teachers are taking responsibility for overseeing aspects of practice.</p><p>Understanding of internal evaluation is developing and results in improved outcomes for children. A suitable framework to support this improvement-focused approach is in place.</p><p>The association has some good processes in place to support teachers. These include an improved inquiry-based appraisal, targeted learning and development opportunities and access to PPLs' guidance. Assisting teachers to implement and embed the new policy framework and reporting requirements, and deciding on the form and function of the PPL role and how this will be enacted in kindergartens, are priorities.</p><p>With the appointment of a new board, GM and leadership team, significant work has been undertaken to review the existing management structures, processes and guidelines for operation, and improve accountability. The board and GM should continue to review and develop governance and operational roles and responsibilities, in consultation with teachers and the community, to support the sustainability of operation and ensure continuous improvement to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for teachers are to continue to develop their:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glamorgan Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to health and safety. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage are secured.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6.</em></p><p>To improve current practice the service provider should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>the current emergency <em><span>management plan is updated.</span></em></li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site stage of the ERO review these issues have been addressed.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>26 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
