</table><p>Cambridge Montessori Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cambridge Montessori Preschool is a privately owned centre located in Leamington, Cambridge. The centre is one of two in Cambridge under the same ownership. Education and care is available from 8am until 4pm for children over two years of age.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 30 children. It is purpose built and has one shared learning space and a large outdoor area.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2016 the ownership of the centre has been retained by one of the previous co-owners. An operations manager role has been developed and an experienced part-time teaching and learning mentor has been employed. There have been some changes to the staff and a new head teacher has been appointed. One of the staff is fully Montessori trained, with one currently completing training. All hold qualifications in early childhood education.</p><p>The preschool states that they offer quality preschool education in a peaceful, friendly environment where children and parents and whƒÅnau feel they belong. The preschool follows the Montessori philosophy and the New Zealand early childhood curriculum <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Teachers place priority on guiding tamariki to reach their full potential and learn through a localised curriculum.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to the recommendations from the previous report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from teachers who are respectful and responsive to their individual learning needs. Teachers regularly connect with families, enhancing learning centred relationships. Children are supported to learn about te ao MƒÅori and other ethnicities through families sharing their knowledge. The service has good systems in place to support children with additional learning needs. Transitions into the centre are well supported. A calm settled environment contributes to a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children experience a broad and rich curriculum that reflects the service's philosophy. The environment equipped with high-quality resources encourages critical thought and wondering. The Montessori areas of the classroom are highly evident. The natural, outdoor environment provides rich learning opportunities. Links with the wider local community provide additional learning opportunities for children. The sequential learning programme encourages independence and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Children's progression of learning in terms of Montessori curriculum learning outcomes is highly visible in individual education plans. Personalised portfolios also capture children's interests and parent contributions. The assessment and planning of learning have been strengthened through professional development and self review to more strongly reflect the learning outcomes of <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> Leaders and teachers should continue to embed and strengthen this process.</p><p>Leaders actively build teacher capability through an effective appraisal system and ongoing mentoring and support. There is a commitment to professional learning and development to meet identified needs of leaders and teachers. Leaders have a strong commitment to teaching and learning that contributes to positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>An established vision, mission and values guide centre practices. Leaders seek external advice and guidance to build their governance capability. They regularly seek and respond to feedback from families. A collaborative strategic plan has been developed. It is now timely to evaluate this in terms of how well the plan is contributing to learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Systems for internal evaluation are becoming established. There is a need to continue to build teacher capability in internal evaluation to further support development and improvement in the centre and evaluate the impact of changes made as a result.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Cambridge Montessori Preschool are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. This should continue to make visible the progression of learning against <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> outcomes and capture children's individual language, culture and identities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher capability in internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cambridge Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>excursion records evidence parental permission of adult-to-child ratios.<br><i><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17.</em></i></li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice, leaders and teachers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>parents are consistently signing the administration of medicine and accident forms.<br><i><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS27, HS28.</em></i></li>
</ul><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>17 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
