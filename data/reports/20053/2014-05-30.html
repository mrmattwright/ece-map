</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gardner Road Kindergarten is a long-established community service, located in leased premises at the rear of the Epsom Presbyterian Church. The teachers and many parents have longstanding connections with the kindergarten.</p><p>High levels of parent involvement are a feature. An elected parent management committee governs the kindergarten and parents are actively involved in fundraising, excursions and family events. Parents appreciate the secure and caring atmosphere in the kindergarten and how well children are prepared for their transition to school.</p><p>In October 2013, after community consultation, the committee made a significant change to hours of operation. The kindergarten now caters for up to 37 children over two years of age between 9am and 2.30pm. There is also provision for some children to attend shorter, sessional times. Three days each week a programme is provided specifically for the older children.</p><p>Day-to-day operations are managed by the head teacher and administrator. The team of six registered teachers is experienced, conscientious and collaborative. They are committed to providing well for children and meeting the expectations of the parent community.</p><p>ERO has consistently reported positively about the kindergarten‚Äôs community focus, teacher interactions with children, and the environment for learning. In 2008 and 2011, ERO recommended that teachers strengthen assessment, programme planning and evaluation practices and their self review systems.</p><p>Teachers have engaged in professional development and made changes over the years, and continue to consider ways to improve their practice in these areas. In 2011, ERO recommended that teachers incorporate bicultural practices to a greater extent.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the kindergarten continue to benefit from good quality teaching practices and from carefully prepared and very well resourced indoor and outdoor learning environments. During most of the programme children work independently or cooperatively in small groups with the interesting activities and resources provided. They are often focused and purposeful as they work, especially with creative materials.</p><p>There is a busy atmosphere of engagement in learning as children and teachers work together. Teachers‚Äô relationships with children and their families are caring and respectful.</p><p>Children are confident, articulate communicators. There are high levels of social interaction amongst children and they readily engage in meaningful conversations with adults. They are used to their ideas being valued and recorded. Teachers support children‚Äôs literacy and numeracy learning well as they play. Children are capable learners. The challenge now for teachers is to support them to develop more collaborative, complex thinking and learning.</p><p>Programme records are well used by children, parents and teachers to revisit learning experiences together. Teachers discuss children‚Äôs learning and reflect on their practices at frequent staff meetings. They often talk with parents about their children‚Äôs learning, have very good knowledge of individual children, and are responsive to children‚Äôs ideas and interests. However, planning and assessment records do not yet reflect these good practices. Teachers agree that they could increase the rigour of programme evaluation, to enhance the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The kindergarten has traditionally had a deliberate balance between teacher directed and child-led activities. It is now timely to review this balance. Reducing time spent in teacher-directed group activities would enable teachers to better promote children‚Äôs independence, leadership, self management and decision-making related to their learning programmes.</p><p>There is a strong sense of partnership between teachers, parents and the committee. The parent community and teachers have high expectations of the kindergarten and for children. Parents on the committee have a sense of ownership and responsibility and a range of valuable skills. Teachers and the committee have established a variety of useful self-review practices, including regular surveys. The committee has also undertaken a strategic review and planning process, particularly concerning long-term sustainability.</p><p>Teachers and the committee have reviewed the kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy statement and begun to review and adapt policies and practices to better suit longer hours of operation. It is appropriate now to undertake a more in-depth philosophy review and to establish shared understandings about its implementation.</p><p>The philosophy statement could better reflect current theories and best practices in early childhood education, and the kindergarten‚Äôs obligations relating to the Treaty of Waitangi. Teachers could also consider how the programme and environment can better reflect the diverse cultures of the Epsom and wider Auckland communities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and management committee have identified appropriate and timely next steps for centre development. These next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing manageable systems for long term and annual planning to guide centre operations, ensure that all requirements are met, and support ongoing improvement</li>
<li>more in-depth self review that includes parent views and a critical evaluation of teaching practices</li>
<li>increasing teachers‚Äô knowledge and confidence in implementing bicultural practices that reflect the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team‚Äôs aim to engage in whole-centre professional development would help them to address these next steps and to continue enhancing their provision for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gardner Road Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gardner Road Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
