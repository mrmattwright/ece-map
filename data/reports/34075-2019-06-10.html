</table><p>Waikids Early Childhood Centre¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikids Early Childhood Centre is located in the paediatric wards of the Waikato Hospital District Health Board, a regional hospital for the Waikato region (DHB). The hospital play specialists (HPS) provide programmes for children admitted to the paediatric wards aimed at minimising the stressors associated with hospitalisation and care of children and their whƒÅnau. The Waikids activity play room is part of the hospital-based early childhood centre, licensed to provide sessional programmes Monday to Friday.</p><p>There are nine HPS who have early childhood teaching qualifications and additional hospital-based qualifications. These specialists provide developmental preparation and medical procedural support within the clinical setting of the paediatric wards, activity room and, by referral, in other sites and clinics within the hospital.</p><p>The service operates under the governance and management of Waikato District Health Board. The management structure is made up of a manager of children‚Äôs health, team leader and play specialists. Since the last ERO review, the service has introduced a team leader position to its management structure. The service has a positive ERO reporting history and responded well to the recommendations of the 2016 ERO report.</p><p>The Waikids philosophy is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> and places priority on family and community/whƒÅnau tangata, holistic development/kotahitanga, relationships/NgƒÅ hononga and empowerment/whakapapa. Education and care values encompass Te Tiriti o Waitangi and promoting the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices. The service operates under the DHB health care model of Te Whare Tapa WhƒÅ.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>HPS practices are highly effective in promoting positive outcomes for children. They enact the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Children and their families benefit from HPS who promote advocacy, diversity, equity, and social justice. Children‚Äôs wellbeing is at the forefront of all decision making.</p><p>HPS skilfully develop strong relationships with families and work in partnership with them. They ensure parents and whƒÅnau have a sense of ownership, are involved in educational and heath care decisions.</p><p>Children's wellbeing is a priority and thoughtfully planned for. A playroom and multi-sensory room provides children and whƒÅnau with relaxing and calming environments away from medical procedures. The rooms are purposefully arranged and children can access high-quality resources to normalise the often unfamiliar hospital environment. Children‚Äôs ongoing learning and positive social interactions are well supported.</p><p>The service's curriculum is highly responsive to the nature and complexity of hospital-based context. Through their play children are supported to develop strategies to cope with potentially stressful situations that are a result of their health needs. They are empowered to develop dispositions such as resilience and positive ways to cope with the challenges of their ongoing medical treatment. HPS use a wide range of highly-effective strategies to support children. They are skilled in developing relationships providing children with encouragement and distraction during medical procedures.</p><p>MƒÅori children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing needs are well supported by HPS. The importance of Treaty of Waitangi partnerships is promoted through reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and a commitment to acknowledging children‚Äôs language, culture and identity through curriculum experiences.</p><p>Individual plans are personalised for the needs of the child and the wider family. HPS have high levels of theoretical knowledge in education and care for children. Collaborative ways of working are fostered within the wider health care organisation. HPS work within a multidisciplinary team of other specialists. Information is shared and this supports HPS to effectively assess, plan and respond to individual children and family circumstances.</p><p>Children‚Äôs ongoing educational interests and needs are catered for in the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>Intentional HPS planning, which follows the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum as well as standards for hospital-based early childhood services.</li>
<li>The intentional provision of curriculum-based play materials for children who are unable to access the play-space.</li>
</ul><p>Management and leadership of the service are highly effective. Strategic planning clearly identifies the services priorities to promote the learning and wellbeing of each child. Progress towards identified strategic goals are monitored and evaluation. Robust internal evaluation practices enable the service to sustain quality and continually improve systems and practice. Currently HPS have individual inquires and goals to continue to develop their practice. Collectively HPS are reviewing the service's bicultural curriculum. These practices ensure the service is very well placed to sustain practices that have positive outcomes for children and their whƒÅnau in the context of a hospital-based environment.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The key next step for Waikids Early Childhood Centre is to continue to develop and evaluate culturally responsive practices for MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikids Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>10 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
