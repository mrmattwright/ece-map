</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (Aotea) is located in Porirua and provides education and care for children from birth to five years. Daily sessions are offered five days a week. The service is licensed for 110 children, including 30 children aged up to two.</p><p>All teachers are fully qualified and assisted by support staff. Since the July 2013 ERO report, a new centre director has been appointed to manage the day-to-day operation of the service.</p><p>Centre operation and programmes are firmly based on three key values identified in the philosophy - to keep children 'Safe, Loved and Learning'.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included: strategies to support MƒÅori success as MƒÅori; a bicultural curriculum; increased family participation and information sharing; self review; and teacher appraisal processes. Progress in these areas is ongoing.</p><p>The service is one of seven early childhood education and care centres in the Wellington region, owned and operated by the national organisation Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based curriculum. They experience a warm and welcoming learning environment. Teachers follow children's interests, working alongside them to support and extend their learning. Routines are consistently implemented which gives children a sense of security.</p><p>Leaders recognise that teachers are at varying levels of skill and experience in responding appropriately to infants' and toddlers' verbal and nonverbal cues. The calm, slow paced routines enable children to have space and time to lead their learning. A next step is for leaders to determine what respectful and responsive caregiving looks like in this context, and to monitor its effective implementation.¬†</p><p>Children's wellbeing is effectively promoted and integrated through the physical activities and the food and nutrition focus of the curriculum.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is in the early stages of development. This is an area that needs to be strengthened in the service.</p><p>Considerable work has been undertaken to promote educational success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori. Teachers regularly seek whƒÅnau aspirations to help support their child's learning. Relationships with families and whƒÅnau are well established in the service. WhƒÅnau expertise is used in the curriculum.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should consider further consulting with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and the Pacific community to define what educational success looks like for their children in this context.</p><p>Leaders have identified that developing learning partnerships with families and whƒÅnau is a key priority. Children's learning profiles highlight their interests, friendships, participation in the programme as well as their physical development. WhƒÅnau and parent feedback and contributions are key features. It is timely for leaders and teachers to revisit the purpose of assessment and to develop a shared understanding of effective practice.</p><p>Group planning is based on themes. Children's learning is extended through the experiences provided by teachers. Leaders agree that a key next step is clearly identifying what the expected learning outcomes are as part of the planning process. This should also assist in evaluating the impact the programme has on children's learning.</p><p>Internal evaluation is improvement focused and teachers are guided by an established process. Implementation of this process needs strengthening. Teachers should consider and analyse a range of evidence to evaluate how well practices support children's learning.</p><p>Emergent leadership is fostered in the service. Systems and processes are used to monitor the implementation of the curriculum, and health and safety processes.</p><p>Regular teacher appraisal is undertaken and has a developmental focus. Ongoing improvement should include clearly documenting the outcome of the goals set and strengthening the support provided to inform the next steps.</p><p>The Kindercare Learning Centres organisation continues to provide strong governance for the service. Established policies, procedures and systems guide the operation of the centre. Clear comprehensive systems support teachers' induction into the service.</p><p>Roles and responsibilities of managers and leaders are clearly defined and well understood. Leadership opportunities are promoted within the centre and ongoing support and professional development is provided.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified that priorities for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen respectful and responsive caregiving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage with MƒÅori and Pacific families to establish a shared understanding of what success for their children is in this context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve assessment, planning and evaluation and the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further enhance appraisal and self-review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (Aotea) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4><b>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</b></h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (Aotea) will be in¬†three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 April 2016¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><div>

</div><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
