<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Lady May is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager (ESM) works with each kindergarten giving feedback and professional support. This kindergarten&rsquo;s rich, inclusive environment and programme celebrate and respect New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage and the cultural diversity represent within the kindergarten community. All teachers employed by Kidsfirst Kindergartens are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight kindergartens and one early childhood education services within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens' umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The positive relationships between children, teachers and parents underpin all aspects of teaching and learning. Teachers have an in-depth knowledge of each child&rsquo;s culture, home language and their family&rsquo;s aspirations. They effectively use this information to make sure that the programme reflects children&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>Teachers use effective strategies to support the learning of children from diverse cultures. M&#257;ori language and tikanga are well embedded in the learning environment and programme. The values of ako and tuakana teina have helped children to learn cooperatively and to support each other in their play. As a result, children and their families have a strong sense of belonging and cultural identity.</p><p>The organisation of the programme and environment actively engages children in purposeful learning. Teachers have developed engaging resources and learning spaces to extend children&rsquo;s confidence, language and creativity. Children have opportunities to lead their learning. They are involved in creating the guidelines for using resources safely. This includes the safe use of technology and equipment.</p><p>Children and their families are well supported when they go to school. Teachers have visited the local schools and have prepared useful resources in Samoan, Chinese and English to help children and families to more confidently transition to school.</p><p>Teachers develop the programme collaboratively. They regularly share and discuss their observations of individual children&rsquo;s learning and identify how they will support and extend children&rsquo;s developing interests. Daily informal discussions with parents help teachers to make links to children&rsquo;s home experiences and prior learning. Children&rsquo;s progress is well documented in children&rsquo;s profiles and well presented in group learning story books.</p><p>Under the strong leadership of the head teacher, self review is used effectively to identify what is going well and where further improvements can be made. Self-review information is well used to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The head teacher recognises the skills and strengths of team members. Teachers make good use of these skills to develop children&rsquo;s interests to benefit their learning in the programme. Teachers have successfully linked professional reading and research to improve children&rsquo;s language learning, cultural awareness and understanding. Teacher appraisal goals are challenging and incorporate individual teachers&rsquo; interests and indicators to improve outcomes for children. This has resulted in strengthening relationships with families and improving children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Kidsfirst has a well-developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long-term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed on the work within the kindergarten. Kidsfirst Kindergartens' managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers in this kindergarten told ERO that the kindergarten benefits from the professional development the association provides and that it is tailored to meet their teaching and learning needs.</p><p>The ESM brings new perspectives to support and extend teacher practices and outcomes for children. The ESM recognises the high quality leadership, teaching practices and the child-centred learning programme as a high quality example for other kindergartens.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The head teacher and teachers have identified, and the ESM and ERO agrees that the next steps for further improving learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening assessment by more consistent use of children&rsquo;s and parents' ideas</li>
<li>continuing to develop the way they document emerging reviews</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for children to use a wider range of information technologies in their learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Lady May completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>21 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
