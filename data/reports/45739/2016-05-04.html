</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Auckland's Best Childcare Centre is a privately owned centre in Auckland's central business district. The centre provides full day care and education for children from birth to five years. Most of the staff have been at the centre since it opened in 2011.</p><p>Children and staff in the centre come from many cultures. Staff support children and families well by using their home languages as well as English in conversations, and by celebrating the centre's cultural diversity in programmes and events.</p><p>ERO first reviewed the centre in 2013. ERO's 2013 report noted areas of strength that included good quality care for children, well considered learning environments, and supportive partnerships with families. These strengths are still evident.</p><p>Since 2013 the leadership structure of the centre has changed. Two head teachers were appointed during 2014. The owner has also managed changes to the premises to meet emergency evacuation requirements. Centre leaders have made some progress in response to the recommendations from the 2013 ERO report. Some of the recommended improvements continue to be areas for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive interactions are evident between teachers and children, and between children of different ages. Children are settled and engage well in their play. Teachers respond well to children‚Äôs ideas and interests. They facilitate conversations that develop children‚Äôs language skills and extend their vocabulary.</p><p>Learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> Teachers use children‚Äôs emerging interests toplan learning programmes, particularly in developing group, room and centre-wide themes. Learning stories identify children's learning that has occurred through their play, and include future possibilities for teachers to extend these interests and learning. The head teachers agree that programme planning could now give greater emphasis to individual children‚Äôs emerging interests. Learning stories could also provide more evidence of ways in which individual interests are revisited and extended over time.</p><p>Children of different ages are catered for in two rooms on separate floors of the building. Indoor and outdoor environments in both rooms are well organised and offer areas where children can play independently or co-operatively. Good use of space provides a variety of learning areas and indoor-outdoor flow. Teachers are continuing to develop more natural learning environments and resources.</p><p>Infants and toddlers under two years have a primary caregiver, so that they receive consistent care from one teacher. They also have many opportunities to develop positive relationships with other teachers. Good care routines are evident. Age-appropriate resources are accessible to children.</p><p>Teachers incorporate early literacy, numeracy and science learning into the activities of older children. Staff support older children‚Äôs transition to school, and are continuing to extend transition processes.</p><p>Teachers are currently involved in professional development to develop a greater focus on bicultural aspects in their curriculum and to increase staff confidence in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Te reo MƒÅori is increasingly incorporated into visual displays, programme planning and interactions with children. Centre leaders have identified this as an area for ongoing development.</p><p>There is some variability in the quality of teaching practices across the centre. Some teachers demonstrate very effective strategies and provide good models for continuing development in this area.</p><p>Staff are developing reflective practices and examples of useful self review are evident. It would be helpful now to establish clear and consistent systems to guide the centre's self-review process and documentation. Leaders should also consider ways to increase the alignment between self-review and annual planning processes.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by annual management plans. Developing long-term strategic goals should support the centre vision and philosophy, increase shared understanding of strategic direction and guide annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Some next steps identified in the 2013 ERO report remain priorities for the centre‚Äôs ongoing development and sustainability. Centre leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extend assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop consistency in good quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen understanding and implementation of self-review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre owner should also consider ways to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and document long-term strategic goals for the centre</p>
</li>
</ul><p>increase clarity around leadership roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre owner accesses appropriate professional development for head teachers to support them in addressing the identified areas for improvement and to strengthen the leadership capacity and sustainability of the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Auckland's Best Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the centre owner should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>schedule regular review of health and safety policies to ensure alignment with current legislation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. The owner must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that police vetting for non-registered staff is up to date<em>[Education Act 1989, Sections 319D to 319FA/FE]</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update the centre's Child Protection Policy to align with requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Auckland's Best Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
