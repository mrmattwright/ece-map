<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Kids Corner - Rothesay Learning Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the 2011 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of education, including interactions, routines and programme planning</li>
<li>the extent to which centre managers have improved the learning environment</li>
<li>the extent to which centre managers have improved self review and management practices</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that arise in the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kids Corner ‚Äì Rothesay Learning Centre is a privately owned centre situated in Rothesay Bay, Auckland. The centre is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 24 children, including up to seven children under two years of age. The centre currently has 12 children on the roll. This is ERO‚Äôs fourth review of the centre in four years.</p><p>This report evaluates the progress made towards addressing the recommendations and areas identified for further improvement in the October 2011 ERO report. In 2011 ERO found that some progress had been made in improving the programme for children. In the past year the centre coordinator and teachers have made further progress in planning and are more able to respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests. Teachers contribute to planning decisions and document assessment of children‚Äôs learning. Children‚Äôs portfolios are now available for children to access and provide good information about children‚Äôs interests and learning. The next step is to ensure that good practices are used by all teachers at all times.</p><p>Children have easy access to resources and areas of play. Using self review to analyse children‚Äôs use of areas of play would strengthen programme planning and enhance learning for children. Some teachers interact well with children and provide some opportunities for learning in their play. Teachers should ensure they use strategies to support and extend child-initiated learning for children of all ages.</p><p>Ongoing development in some areas of management is evident. Review of centre policies is established. Self review of aspects of centre operations is strengthening systems and practices. A more strategic coordinated approach to centre management and future planning is yet to be developed.</p><p>The 2009, 2010 and 2011 ERO reports recommended that the licensee seek external support to improve centre and programme management. The licensee has not acted on these recommendations. The centre continues to struggle to maintain any improvements in management systems and programme quality.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education prioritise the relicensing of Kids Corner ‚Äì Rothesay Learning Centre and assess the centre‚Äôs compliance with the 2008 regulations and applicable licensing criteria. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>In 2011 ERO found that some progress had been made in improving the programme for children. ERO also noted extending children‚Äôs learning, review and enrichment of the environment and assessment, planning and evaluation were areas in which further improvements were needed.</p><h4>Area of progress</h4><p><em>Programme planning and assessment.</em> Some progress has been made in improving the programme for children. A more systematic approach to programme planning has been developed, based on the identification of children‚Äôs interests and planning for individual children. A model of assessment and evaluation against learning outcomes identified for each child is being implemented. Children‚Äôs portfolios are now readily accessible.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p><em>Extending children‚Äôs learning.</em> Teachers should continue to develop and use strategies that support and extend child-initiated learning. Staff could respond more consistently to children‚Äôs cues and ask open-ended questions that capture their interest and encourage conversation. Teachers should ensure that their interactions with children are respectful, and that programmes offer challenge and new learning for children of all ages.</p><p><em>The learning environment.</em> Staff have reorganised the centre layout to provide children with free movement and more ready access to resources. However many of the resources for children‚Äôs play are shabby, unclean and cluttered. Staff should systematically review and improve the learning resources to provide:</p><ul>
<li>more open-ended resources that encourage children‚Äôs extended and imaginative play</li>
<li>more opportunities for literacy and numeracy learning</li>
<li>more displays that celebrate children‚Äôs learning and attract children to revisit their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Self review and management practices</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2011 ERO review identified that management systems were being re-established after changes in centre personnel. The new centre coordinator was providing good professional leadership and supporting staff to improve the quality of education and care provided. There have been no further changes in management since the last review. Some systems have been established and implemented consistently.</p><h4>Area of progress</h4><p><em>Self review.</em> A process of self review is being implemented. The process makes reference to research, uses Ministry of Education and ERO resources and suggests actions to be taken. Centre policies are reviewed, with staff and parents providing input and feedback through the review process.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p><em>Programme self review and development.</em> Managers should raise the quality of their self review process so that children receive higher quality education and care. The primary objective of self review should be improving the quality of learning for children. Reviewing the centre philosophy and the extent to which the centre meets regulatory requirements should be a priority.</p><p><em>Strategic and annual planning.</em> The centre strategic plan should be strengthened by placing a greater focus on learning and including specific goals, timeframes and resource allocations. The annual plan should reflect priorities taken from the strategic plan, and progress towards meeting annual targets or goals should be reported.</p><p><em>Staff professional development.</em> Staff have received no professional development over the past year. ERO recommends that external professional support be accessed in order to support centre managers to improve management practices and teachers to develop their practice.</p><p><em>Centre coordinator appraisal.</em> The centre coordinator has not been appraised over the 18 months that she has been in this role. ERO recommends that the licensee seek an appropriate appraiser as a matter of urgency. A full appraisal of the coordinator‚Äôs management and teaching roles should be completed annually.</p><p><em>Health and safety.</em> The licensee has some aspects of health and safety to address immediately. They include:</p><ul>
<li>promptly and effectively addressing trip hazards such as the uneven and unstable paved areas in the entrance to the centre</li>
<li>ensuring that the supervision requirement for having registered teachers staffing the centre at all times is met at all times</li>
<li>ensuring police vetting of non-qualified or in-training staff is up to date.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>4 Recommendation</span></h2><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education prioritise the relicensing of Kids Corner ‚Äì Rothesay Learning Centre and assess the centre‚Äôs compliance with the 2008 regulations and applicable licensing criteria.

<li>make the audited annual financial statement available to educators, parents/guardians, whƒÅnau, the local community and government to account for the use of Ministry of Education funding <em>[Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices, 1996 12C]</em></li>

The centre is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 24 children, including up to seven children under two years of age. The centre currently has 12 children on the roll. This is ERO‚Äôs fourth review of the centre in four years.</p><p>This report evaluates the progress made towards addressing the recommendations and areas identified for further improvement in the October 2011 ERO report. In 2011 ERO found that some progress had been made in improving the programme for children. In the past year the centre coordinator and teachers have made further progress in planning and are more able to respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests. Teachers contribute to planning decisions and document assessment of children‚Äôs learning. Children‚Äôs portfolios are now available for children to access and provide good information about children‚Äôs interests and learning. The next step is to ensure that good practices are used by all teachers at all times.</p><p>Children have easy access to resources and areas of play. Using self review to analyse children‚Äôs use of areas of play would strengthen programme planning and enhance learning for children. Some teachers interact well with children and provide some opportunities for learning in their play. Teachers should ensure they use strategies to support and extend child-initiated learning for children of all ages.</p><p>Ongoing development in some areas of management is evident. Review of centre policies is established. Self review of aspects of centre operations is strengthening systems and practices. A more strategic coordinated approach to centre management and future planning is yet to be developed.</p><p>The 2009, 2010 and 2011 ERO reports recommended that the licensee seek external support to improve centre and programme management. The licensee has not acted on these recommendations. The centre continues to struggle to maintain any improvements in management systems and programme quality.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education prioritise the relicensing of Kids Corner ‚Äì Rothesay Learning Centre and assess the centre‚Äôs compliance with the 2008 regulations and applicable licensing criteria. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p>
