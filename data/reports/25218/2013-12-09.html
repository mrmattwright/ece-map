</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tuakau Playcentre provides for up to 30 children and their families in a small rural Franklin township. It is cooperatively managed and programmes for children are implemented by the families who are centre members. The centre offers three general sessions each week when children attend with their parents, and an extended session for a small group of children over the age of three. The playcentre philosophy of whƒÅnau and children learning together underpins centre operations.</p><p>Tuakau Playcentre is one of 17 centres in the Counties Playcentre Association, which provides a management and policy framework for centre operations. Liaison workers and other elected Association officers provide support for centres. Association members deliver the playcentre adult education programme to help whƒÅnau build their understanding about children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2010 review, some experienced centre members have moved on and the roll has been gradually rebuilt. Many families are new to playcentre. The majority of parents involved in implementing sessions are participating in playcentre adult education courses. They appreciate the support they receive in their parenting and educator roles.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 8 playcentre reviews in the Counties Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The relationships amongst families and the high ratio of adults to children contribute to a nurturing environment where children and their families feel a sense of belonging and community. The shared knowledge that adults have about their children helps them to provide interesting and varied learning experiences.</p><p>Children enjoy a positive, well resourced learning environment. There is a settled and welcoming atmosphere and children are encouraged to develop social skills and relationships. Toddlers follow older children‚Äôs lead and are able to join in their activities.</p><p>Children choose from the wide variety of activities and play spaces and are well supported by adults. The large outdoor areas provide many opportunities for physical challenge. A recently developed ‚Äòbicultural‚Äô garden offers an inviting, natural area for children to explore and includes features that reflect the centre‚Äôs history and community. It would be worthwhile for the centre to work with the Association‚Äôs bicultural development team to explore the concepts contained in <em>Ka Hikitia</em>, the Ministry of Education‚Äôs strategy for fostering success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>The centre has a useful process for assessment, planning and evaluation. Some centre members are skilled at writing learning stories and model this assessment practice for others. Centre members are considering ways to build on this foundation to better plan for and record children‚Äôs learning progress over time.</p><p>The centre benefits from enthusiastic, energetic leadership with a focus on providing well for children and their whƒÅnau. All centre members are encouraged to become involved in centre management and have opportunities to develop leadership skills. The centre employs ex playcentre members with Course 3 training to support programme implementation and to help newer members with their training.</p><p>Good systems are in place for centre management. Informal self review is ongoing and contributes to improvements, especially in the environment. More formal, in-depth self review is still developing. The centre‚Äôs strategic vision and plan, and supporting action plans are in the early stages of development. Centre members are considering ways to make planning and self review more useful, meaningful and manageable and to keep outcomes for children at the forefront of their decision making. Increasing the visibility of planning and review documents and practices should help to develop shared understandings amongst newer members.</p><p>Association management practices are well established. Self review involves centre members, and contributes to decision making. A strategic review is currently underway, with a view to streamlining Association systems and practices and making them more manageable for playcentre members. This review could also consider how the association can provide earlier, more focused support for centres that are facing challenges. Liaison workers should consider ways to help centres establish effective strategic and annual planning, and strengthen their self-review practices. Monitoring and supporting the quality of programmes in centres should be a more central aspect of the liaison worker role.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agree that next steps for the centre, in order to build on current practices that effectively promote positive outcomes for children, include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop adults‚Äô skills in supporting children to think, reason and solve problems independently</li>
<li>refining planning for children‚Äôs learning to help adults respond to what they learn about children interests and capabilities throughout the week</li>
<li>identifying best practice in supporting children as they approach transition to school and including these practices in all sessions that children attend</li>
<li>strengthening strategic and annual planning and self-review processes to support ongoing centre growth and development.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>As a result of this cluster of reviews ERO recommends that the Counties Playcentre Association access support from the Ministry of Education and the NZ Playcentre Federation to help them to refine the Association‚Äôs structure, systems and practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tuakau Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tuakau Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>9 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
