<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Pauanui Pre School is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Pauanui Pre-School, formally known as Pauanui Play School, is located in a small beach community on the Coromandel Peninsular. The centre is owned and governed by a parent-led charitable trust. The pre-school provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age, and is licensed for 25 children, including up to 8 under two years. There is currently a multicultural roll of 27 children, one of whom is MƒÅori.</p><p>Since the last review, due to demographic changes in the community, there has been a period of roll fluctuation. There has also been a reorganisation of leadership in the centre and there are now two joint head teachers and a new teacher‚Äôs aide. Members of the parent-elected board are all new since the last review. The centre has recently been relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. There has been ongoing upgrading of the building and outdoor environment.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy for children‚Äôs learning emphasises empowerment, the holistic development of each child, positive relationships and a close partnership with community and whƒÅnau. ERO observed the philosophy being well reflected in the learning programme and operation of the centre.</p><p>There has been good progress in addressing the area for review and development identified in the last ERO report about policy review. There was a staff professional development focus during 2012 about the integration of mathematics into the learning programme involving external support.</p><p>The centre continues to be an important focal point for this small community in which children and their families have a strong sense of belonging.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre presents an attractive and richly resourced learning environment in which children are encouraged to follow their interests. Children have ready access to a range of learning experiences, both inside and outside, covering all aspects of the curriculum. They are able to make choices and play independently or in cooperation with others. There is a strong focus on learning about the natural world and effective use is made of the local and wider community to extend children‚Äôs experiences. Opportunities for literacy and mathematics learning are meaningfully integrated within the programme. The centre is developing positive relationships with the local primary school and children are well supported in their transition to school. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori teaching and learning are reflected in the environment, centre programme and daily routines.</p><p>Teachers plan effectively for children‚Äôs learning. This planning is guided by children‚Äôs interests as well as local and topical events. Children‚Äôs discovery books provide well presented records of their learning and include evidence of parents‚Äô involvement in the planning process.</p><p>Relationships within the centre are positive and caring, contributing to a warm family atmosphere. There is a strong emphasis on supporting children to develop social competencies and confidence. Older children provide support for younger children.</p><p>Shared leadership by the two head teachers is working well. They are knowledgeable about good practice in early childhood education, reflective about their own practice and are committed to ongoing professional development. There is a systematic approach to self review especially in relation to teaching and learning. Together with the teacher‚Äôs aide, the head teachers make a strong team which has developed a positive partnership with parents.</p><p>The parent elected board is providing effective governance for the centre and is proactive in seeking to ensure sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to promote positive outcomes for children, ERO and the centre agree that:</p><ul>
<li>the board and head teachers should further develop the strategic plan to make goals more specific, with an indication of how they are to be achieved</li>
<li>head teachers should continue to review their learning conversations with children to ensure that there is a focus on extending children‚Äôs thinking and learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pauanui Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h4>Equity Funding</h4><p>This service is not meeting some aspects of the Equity Funding reporting requirements. In order to address this the centre must:</p><ul>
<li>report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their equity funding.</li>
</ul><p>This report must include:</p><ul>
<li>an outline of the amount received under each Equity Funding component</li>
<li>a brief description to which the funding was applied; and</li>
<li>a brief outline of the reasons for spending the funding in that way.</li>
</ul><p>The report must be included in the service‚Äôs annual report for presentation at its annual general meeting.</p><blockquote>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
