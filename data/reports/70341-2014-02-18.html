</table><p>CPIT Early Learning Centre is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>CPIT Early Learning Centre provides good-quality care and education for children from six months to school age.</p><p>The centre is located on the campus of Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT). CPIT oversees the operations of the Early Learning Centre. They share facilities with a MƒÅori bilingual early childhood centre on the same site. A large number of families at the centre have an association with the tertiary institution.</p><p>The 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes had a negative impact on the operation and management of the centre. This included the forced closure of the centre for a period of time despite the fact the centre was not damaged, movement of families out of Christchurch, and loss of staff.</p><p>The centre has undertaken extensive self review to address the recommendations from the August 2010 ERO review. As a result, group times, planning and assessment have improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum has strong links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Teachers help children develop in all areas of their learning. Particular emphasis is given to building children‚Äôs confidence and self management skills. Literacy, speaking and numeracy skills are also focused on.</p><p>Children come from a diverse range of cultures. Teachers have identified ways to appropriately celebrate diversity.</p><p>In the under two area, there are warm, caring relationships between teachers and parents, and teachers with infants and toddlers. Teachers engage with children in meaningful conversations and at times encourage them to extend their thinking. They foster children‚Äôs emotional wellbeing and social skills. Primary caregiving roles support infants and toddlers to develop social and emotional skills and give parents confidence in the care provided. Children settle quickly and effortlessly into the routines.</p><p>Toddlers and pre-school children enjoy exploring the spacious, attractive, well-organised and equipped indoor and natural outdoor learning environment. They are actively involved in a wide range of interesting learning experiences. Children are well supported to develop positive interactions with others.</p><p>Teachers make good use of their knowledge of children to plan different ways to extend the learning of individual children and groups. They share daily observations of children at play, and encourage input from other teachers observations to identify ways to respond and extend children‚Äôs learning. Teachers look for deliberate teaching possibilities such as extending vocabulary by introducing new words.</p><p>Learning stories are an effective, formal record of assessment that track children‚Äôs progress and identify what teachers will do to extend their learning. Parents are encouraged to provide supporting links from home and possible next learning steps. There are some good examples of parent feedback.</p><p>In both learning areas, well-resourced spaces are arranged to allow for choice, space to move and room for independent and group play. The outdoor environment is easy to explore, has a range of physical equipment to challenge children, and includes edible and native plantings.</p><p>The centre manager has developed a strong, collaborative team culture. She is making good use of self review to encourage staff participation in professional development and to improve teaching practice. Leadership development is a particular strength. The manager encourages teachers to take a more active role in leading development within the centre. There is a comprehensive appraisal system in place to support teachers to improve their teaching practice and to develop new understandings and skills to benefit children‚Äôs learning. The centre has a detailed three year strategic plan to guide the future direction of the centre.</p><p>Senior leaders and teachers have well-developed systems and processes in place to support children‚Äôs transition into, within and out of the centre. The transition to school process is well-planned and managed. Parent evenings have supported transition by informing parents about changes and what they can do to contribute to better support their child.</p><p>Parents have good opportunities to work in partnership with staff to benefit children‚Äôs learning. An advisory committee plays an important role in monitoring and setting a future direction for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve outcomes for children, senior leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen processes for self review by embedding practice and evaluating the impact of reviews on children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>to increase the input from parents, teachers and the advisory committee in strategic planning to better reflect centre aspirations for children</li>
<li>develop further the use of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori within learning programmes</li>
<li>reflect the commitment in the centre‚Äôs philosophy to cultural diversity by identifying ways to better reflect children‚Äôs cultures within the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Senior leaders acknowledged that their efforts to encourage greater parent participation in learning stories have been challenging. They have identified a different approach they believe will increase parent input.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of CPIT Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of CPIT Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
