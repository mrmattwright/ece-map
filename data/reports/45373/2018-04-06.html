</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Stoddard is licensed to provide all-day education and care for up to 98 children including 24 aged under two years. There are separate indoor and outdoor play spaces for infants. The toddlers have their own indoor space and share the outdoor area with the older children. Children attending the service come from a very diverse range of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre manager works with an assistant manager and head teacher to ensure the smooth running of the centre. The teaching team includes a further eight qualified teachers, and reflects the cultures of the children who attend the service.</p><p>The teaching philosophy is presented in three different languages to ensure it is accessible by families. It is based on play-based programmes that promote children's 'fascinations' and independence. Developing genuine relationships with children, whānau and community is important to the team.</p><p>Centre leaders continue to strengthen the key development areas identified in the 2014 ERO report. These include teachers' appraisals, internal evaluation and bicultural practice.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven education and care service reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage positively in the activities that teachers provide for them. They have good access to resources to support their play, and confidently choose where they will spend their time. Older children are building friendships as they play together in well considered spaces. Teachers interact respectfully with children and their whānau.</p><p>The play space for infants caters well for these children. Teachers present resources in interesting ways and are responsive to children's needs. Their ability to use home languages is comforting for children. Centre leaders and teachers work in sensitive, inclusive ways to settle children into the centre and to transition between the spaces allocated to the different age groups. They work well with external agencies to provide specialised support for those children who need additional care.</p><p>Teachers could now consider ways to increase the extent to which their teaching practices and the physical environment respond to and reflect children's cultural backgrounds. Play spaces could also be reviewed to evaluate how well they support children to engage with the natural world and in sustained, complex projects.</p><p>Teachers value and make the most of the opportunities to engage in meaningful discussions with parents at pick-up and drop-off times. These discussions support the development of meaningful relationships. Teachers are now developing ways to weave this shared information into children's individual portfolios of learning.</p><p>Teachers are working to redevelop their programme planning with a focus on supporting children's dispositions for learning. Photographs of children as they engage in learning are used well to inform parents who have English as an additional language, about their children's participation in the programme. Teachers are establishing ways of growing parents' understanding about the effectiveness of a play-based curriculum in promoting children's learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have established a consultative process for internal evaluation. Learning from this process is valued and included in the centre's strategic plan. Teachers' professional learning is helping to strengthen their practice and build the team in a purposeful way.</p><p>BestStart has recently developed a strategic plan to guide the organisation's future direction. Managers are working to increase coherence and alignment between organisational and individual centres' annual and strategic planning. The teacher appraisal process has been redeveloped with a focus on lifting teacher practice through individual inquiry. Managers will continue to provide targeted support to ensure these documents become familiar to teachers, and contribute to improved consistency in the quality of programmes across centres.</p><p>To support the provision of a broader curriculum in the outdoors, it would be worthwhile for BestStart managers and teachers to review and improve the design and layout of these learning environments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening teachers' understanding and inclusion of te reo and te ao Māori throughout the programme</li>
<li>enhancing the environment to more strongly reflect the varied cultures of the children and their families</li>
<li>a review of the environment to consider how it could better support children's engagement with the natural world, and encourage more complex thinking</li>
<li>strengthening the evaluative aspects of internal evaluation. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Stoddard completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Stoddard will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>6 April 2018<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
