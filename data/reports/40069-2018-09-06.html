</table><p>Op≈çtiki Community Childcare Centre requires support to build understanding of effective governance, management and leadership to better promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Op≈çtiki Community Childcare Centre is situated in the Op≈çtiki College grounds and is located in the Eastern Bay of Plenty. The centre provides education and care for children aged four months to five years. Since the 2015 ERO review the centre's licence has been extended. The centre is now able to provide care and education for 70 children including 15 aged under two years, at any one time. The current roll of 80 children includes 55 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The majority of the teaching team has remained the same with new appointments made to support the increasing roll. Significant renovations to the centre are underway, designed to support the increasing number of children, and provide areas for staff to undertake non-contact work.</p><p>The centre philosophy was recently reviewed. It outlines that children are the central focus. Children are encouraged to discover and enjoy learning at their own pace, and to develop an understanding of the world around them. Teachers value and work collaboratively alongside children, their parents, whƒÅnau, and the community, building respectful, responsive and reciprocal relationships. A welcoming environment supports children to develop a sense of belonging.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2015, the centre has:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>accessed a wide range of centre-wide teacher professional development for teachers to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes. This area for development requires further strengthening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewed the balance between teacher-led and child-initiated activities to provide a programme that is more responsive to children‚Äôs interests. A more appropriate balance is now evident in the over two years areas. It remains an area for improvement in the under twos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhanced children‚Äôs access to a wide range of learning resources and equipment and this is now supporting an improved learning programme and environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's vision and philosophy guides decision making throughout the centre. Leaders are focussed on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing reflection and self review. Children engage in their chosen learning and leadership is actively promoted. Positive interactions are evident.</p><p>Teachers support children‚Äôs play through questioning and sharing ideas. Oral language, numeracy and literacy are naturally woven throughout the daily programme. Reciprocal and respectful relationships with parents and whƒÅnau support transition into, through and beyond the centre. Children are confident to take risks and challenge themselves centre wide.</p><p>Children with additional needs are actively supported to fully participate in the centre's programme. Appropriate specialist agencies for children with additional needs are involved in individual educational plans and in supporting the centre. Individual learning plans support teaching and learning and reflect the child's progress over time.</p><p>Children under the age of two years learn in a home-like environment. A stable and consistent teaching team fosters secure connections for children. Parents and whƒÅnau are welcomed and encouraged to play alongside their children. Building understanding of effective teaching in the He Kakano area to guide children to lead their own learning and foster them to be capable of making their own decisions, is an area for development.</p><p>A wide range of experiences and resources promote a rich curriculum for children. Leaders and teachers value and acknowledge parent aspirations for their children. Trips and excursions into the local community extend children‚Äôs learning. Teachers are extending their understanding and beginning to authentically weave te reo MƒÅori, local stories and people and places of significance throughout the programme for learning.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning stories reflect their participation within the programme and environment. Programme planning is thematic with a mix of activities and experiences offered for children. Children are actively encouraged to deepen their knowledge of who they are and the world around them and the uniqueness of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Planning and assessment requires strengthening to increase the visibility of children‚Äôs language, culture and identity in assessment. Extending teachers' understanding to show progress and continuity of learning over time is a key next step.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are encouraged to take on leadership roles and responsibilities in this service. Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and guide daily operation. The centre is governed by a group of parents that represent the centre on the management committee. They receive regular reports. Formalising and strengthening planning and systems for effective governance, management and leadership is needed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for the centre are to strengthen governance, leadership and assessment, planning and evaluation. Particular priority needs to be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepening the understanding of effective strategic evaluation and self review for ongoing improvement centre wide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing centre-wide expectations for high-quality teaching and learning for consistency and accountability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending leaders and teachers understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation to show progress and continuity of learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing robust health and safety practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opotiki Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to toileting and sleep facilities and hazard identification. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>privacy for children in toileting and nappy changing and the facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate viewing of children in the sleep room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a robust hazard register for identification of hazards in the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate safety checks for contractors working onsite</p>
</li>
</ul><p>[<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF20, PF22, PF25, PF37, HS12, Health and Safety in the Workplace Act 2015]</em></p><p>During the onsite phase of the review a significant number of hazards and risks were identified by ERO. The centre responded immediately and eliminated risk for the children in relation to the earthquake fall hazards identified.</p><p>The centre needs to develop robust systems and procedures to support self-identification of potential risk and hazards to children‚Äôs safety. This should include building leaders' and teachers' understanding of regulatory and statutory requirements for early childhood services.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Opotiki Community Childcare Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>6 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
