</table><p>Koru Kids Preschool requires further development to be well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The service requires support to improve the quality of leadership and governance.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Koru Kids Preschool in Whangarei is licensed to provide education and care for up to 30 children aged over two years. The centre is privately owned and operates from a modified building close to the city’s commercial centre. Parents enrol their children for full days or sessions.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report was the first for the centre under the name of Noah’s Ark Learning Centre. This 2012 ERO report identified the need for managers to improve teaching and learning practice and leadership.</p><p>In 2013 the centre was purchased by new owners with early childhood teaching experience. The centre’s name and philosophy was reviewed and changed. Since then the centre owners have faced several challenges including staffing, enrolments and some aspects of leadership and governance.</p><p>The centre’s vision is for children and teachers to ‘grow, love and learn together’. The philosophy is closely aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and focuses on children being confident, independent and interested learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They settle quickly on arrival and seek out their friends to play. Children share their ideas confidently with each other and with adults. This supports children to develop social and emotional skills.</p><p>Children make decisions about and direct their own play. They engage well with their learning and are familiar with the routines of the day. There is a good balance between child directed and teacher led activities.</p><p>Positive, warm relationships are evident between children and teachers. Teachers appropriately support children as they play. External professionals provide advice for teachers about effective ways to support children with special learning needs.</p><p>Teachers have a good awareness of the importance of developing early literacy and numeracy skills. They support parents to understand how this can be promoted in the context of children’s play.</p><p>Teachers create a homely feel through the centre’s environment. A good variety of resources is easily accessible to children. Teachers create displays to motivate children’s curiosity and provide areas where they can play uninterrupted. Good use is made of the small well-designed outdoor area to provide opportunities for children to explore and learn together.</p><p>Teachers regularly notice and record children’s interests and preferred areas of play. They plan collaboratively to provide activities that foster these interests and promote the aspirations parents have for their children’s learning.</p><p>The service provider is actively involved in the daily running of the centre. She has sought advice and received regular support from the Ministry of Education. Some experienced early childhood centre managers also provide guidance and mentoring for the service provider. Positive relationships exist between teachers and adults focus on what is good and effective for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service provider and ERO agree that external support would be helpful in improving aspects of management including:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening policies and procedures including personnel and health and safety</li>
<li>continuing to align documented centre policies and procedures with practice</li>
<li>further developing strategic, annual and financial planning</li>
<li>developing self-review processes that support ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><p>In order to promote the centre’s vision and to improve teaching practice and leadership, centre leaders and teachers should establish clear expectations of teacher practice, including:</p><ul>
<li>identifying the teacher's role in extending children’s thinking and the complexity of their play</li>
<li>continuing to improve the quality of planning and assessment processes</li>
<li>reviewing the use of learning spaces and the impact on the flow of the programme</li>
<li>continuing to develop and strengthen programmes that support Māori children in their language, culture and identity and promote bicultural practice for all children</li>
<li>finding further ways to reflect and celebrate the cultural diversity of children in the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Koru Kids Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the service manager should:</p><ul>
<li>improve the quality of policies and procedures related to health and safety, personnel and financial management</li>
<li>further develop annual and strategic planning.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also identified one area of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>self review is used to improve the quality of the service.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, R46 (1 a), R47 (1 a, e)</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Koru Kids Preschool will be within two years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>14 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
