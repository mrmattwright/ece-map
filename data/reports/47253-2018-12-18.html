</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Hastings Early Learning Centre is a privately owned service, located in central Hastings. It is in close proximity to local schools and licensed to provide all day education and care for 100 children, including 30 up to the age of two years. Of the 81 children currently enrolled, 28 identify as MƒÅori and 10 are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The philosophy is underpinned by the core values of whƒÅnau/family, respect, adventure and passion. The service states its purpose is 'to create magical learning experiences for children and their families'.</p><p>Three separate rooms cater for different ages of children. Some shared spaces allow for children aged over 18 months to be together. Each room has its own teaching team and room leader.</p><p>The service is governed by a board of directors. A centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the service and reports to the board.</p><p>The centre opened in July 2017. This is its first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have plentiful opportunities to experiment and discover within a well-considered environment. They easily access a wide range of open-ended resources that promote exploration. Children make connections to te ao MƒÅori through this environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a calm, settled environment that allows them to discover at their own pace. Secure attachments to key caregivers are highly evident. Attentive teachers respond to their individual needs and wants.</p><p>Strong relationships with many parents, family and whƒÅnau are established. Teachers acknowledge and value the diverse cultures of the children who attend the centre. They use familiar cultural artefacts and language to promote a sense of belonging. Parents are well informed of their children's learning and participation in the programme.</p><p>Strategies to promote educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific learners is developing. Some teachers demonstrate culturally responsive practices. Continuing to strengthen this across the service should be an ongoing focus to inform individual planning for children and the curriculum.</p><p>Children's learning assessment records capture their participation, interests and developing relationships with their peers. Teachers notice these interests and intentionally plan to extend them. A key next step is to strengthen the planning process to identify teaching that progresses learning.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are well supported. Teachers and families work alongside each other to support their ongoing development and inclusion within the centre. Leaders and teachers access external agencies as required and engage in professional learning opportunities to strengthen their knowledge of current practice.</p><p>The philosophy aspires to create a learning environment that promotes the core values of the service. Leaders and teachers should now use this as a platform to define what the priorities are for children's learning in consultation with family, whƒÅnau and iwi. This should support a consistent, centre-wide approach to the enactment of the philosophy.</p><p>Leaders have identified that the appraisal process requires further strengthening. ERO's evaluation confirms this need. A useful framework is in place to guide practice. Developing leaders' and teachers' understanding of the Education Council expectations of quality appraisal is a priority.</p><p>Self review is used to revisit some key areas of teaching practice and support ongoing developments. There is a clear focus on enhancing the centre environment and resources for children. Deepening understanding and use of internal evaluation that emphasises improved teaching and learning practices is a key next step at all levels of operation.</p><p>Good systems and processes have been developed to guide the operation of the service. The board of directors is well informed about what is happening for children within the individual rooms. Leaders should now consider how to monitor the implementation of procedures and initiatives to ensure consistency and quality of practice across the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for Central Hastings Early Learning Centre are to continue to improve consistency of practice across the service through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing priorities for children's learning and related indicators of high quality practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a robust appraisal process to support the development of teachers' practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing understanding and use of internal evaluation focused on children's outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving monitoring of the implementation of policies and processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Hastings Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that sufficient risk assessment and management of excursions is consistently completed, including the notification of approved adult-to-child ratios for parent approval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a procedure for travel by motor vehicle to ensure parent permission and appropriate systems are in place when required.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Hastings Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>18 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
