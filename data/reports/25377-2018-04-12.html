</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Dannemora offers all-day and sessional early childhood education and care for a maximum of 105 children, including 25 up to the age of two years. Children from three months to five years are catered for in five age-related learning areas.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes a strong sense of belonging and whanaungatanga. It expresses the belief that children are unique, competent and empowered to make choices within an environment that inspires them to explore and create. A commitment to the bicultural partnership with Māori and strong partnerships with whānau supports an inclusive and culturally respectful environment.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted areas of good practice, including children's interactions and relationships with each other and adults. The report commented on teachers' commitment to ensuring success for Māori children as Māori. Leaders and teachers continue to build on these good practices. ERO also noted that self review and programme planning needed improving. There has been a positive response to these recommendations.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven education and care service reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is fully enacted in programmes. Children and whānau feel a strong sense of belonging to the centre. They are welcomed, and supported to transition into, through and out of the centre. Families who are new to the area and to New Zealand benefit from teachers' inclusive and culturally appropriate practices.</p><p>Children settle quickly into the programme and are supported through nurturing and affirming relationships. Teachers focus on building social competence and caring for children's wellbeing and learning needs. There are high expectations that children will manage self-care routines and respect each other.</p><p>Infants form attachments quickly and settle well within a strong primary care approach. Warm and nurturing relationships support children to use their home languages confidently with each other and with teachers. Children choose to play freely indoors and outdoors, and enjoy conversations that enable them to explore their ideas. Their perspectives are valued and used to inform teachers' planning.</p><p>The curriculum is highly responsive to families' cultures and children's interests and needs. The impact of teachers' professional learning is evident in the rich, responsive programmes for children. Teachers value and use children's feedback and ideas to plan and extend learning through play.</p><p>There is an ongoing focus on bicultural and multicultural learning as part of the curriculum. Te reo and tikanga Māori are seen and heard, and children respond positively to karakia and waiata. Support from BestStart and external cultural expertise is helping teachers to enhance the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers promote the centre's clear vision and philosophy. Teachers use quality indicators to make the philosophy visible for parents, and build strong partnerships with parents and whānau to support children's learning.</p><p>Good systems that promote stability and strengthen evaluation are helping the staff to sustain high quality performance. Positive, effective leadership has contributed to respectful relationships, a cohesive team and a strong focus on continual improvement. There is a collaborative approach to decision making and strategic development.</p><p>BestStart has recently developed a strategic plan to guide the organisation's future direction. Managers are working to increase coherence and alignment between organisational and individual centres' annual and strategic planning. The teacher appraisal process has been redeveloped with a focus on lifting teacher practice through individual inquiry. Managers will continue to provide targeted support to ensure these documents become familiar to teachers, and contribute to improved consistency in the quality of programmes across centres.</p><p>To support the provision of a broader curriculum in the outdoors, it would be worthwhile for managers and teachers to review and improve the design and layout of these learning environments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified appropriate next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to grow leadership capacity</li>
<li>prioritising the implementation of <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em>, with a focus on developing a localised curriculum</li>
<li>implementing more formalised approaches to 'teaching as inquiry'.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Dannemora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Dannemora will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>12 April 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
