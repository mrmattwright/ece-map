</table><p>Picton Community Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre is a non-profit community-based early learning centre governed by a parent committee. The centre has created strong links with the local community.</p><p>The centre's facilities include separate indoor and spacious outdoor areas for children who are under-two and over-two years old. The majority of the teaching staff are qualified early childhood teachers, many of whom have worked at the centre for a number of years.</p><p>The centre's head teacher and manager have maintained the strengths evident at the time of the centre's 2009 ERO review and have addressed and embedded the areas that required further development at the time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is strongly evident. Staff actively foster children's wellbeing and sense of belonging through inclusive practices and positive, responsive, respectful relationships.</p><p>Teachers have a good knowledge of individual children and their families. Strong partnerships have been established with the parents who take an active role in developing learning goals for their children and evaluating progress. Many parents share aspects of their culture in the programme to benefit all children.</p><p>The curriculum successfully promotes children's learning and wellbeing. Programmes evolve from children's individual strengths, interests and needs. Literacy, mathematics and physical activity are included in ways that are meaningful and extend children's thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Children are well supported to lead their learning. Teachers observe, listen, respond, and participate with children in ways that help to extend their interests, ideas and creativity.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are well integrated into the programme by teachers and parents working together and sharing their knowledge. Children are proud of their Māori heritage, and willingly practice and participate in community events.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have make very good use of professional development to develop child assessment practices that effectively identify children's learning and progress. The assessments clearly show the ways teachers have promoted learning and the learning outcomes of these actions. Children's home cultures, including te reo and tikanga Māori are skilfully interwoven in the learning stories and evaluations.</p><p>The nurturing relationships that exist between the teachers and the infants and toddlers ensure that these young children are settled and confident in the nursery environment. Teachers use a good range of approaches to help infants and toddlers become active explorers and to participate in the programme and daily routines.</p><p>Leaders have established good systems and structures for the operation of the centre. They actively foster ongoing improvements to programmes and practices. Decision making clearly focuses on promoting the best possible care and education for children. Leadership and management practices help to promote good levels of teamwork and collaboration. </p><p>Ongoing centre improvement is well supported by regular professional development and robust self reviews. These two factors have contributed to notable improvements to the centre's documented philosophy, assessment and planning for individual children, evaluation and aspects of centre plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the need steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>improving the quality of the group plans and evaluations</li>
<li>embedding and building on recent initiatives for strategic planning, staff appraisals and self review. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Picton Community Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Picton Community Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>2 June 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
