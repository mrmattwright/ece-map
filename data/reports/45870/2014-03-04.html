</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Heuheu St Community Kindy provides all day and sessional education and care for children aged 2 to 5 Years in a mixed-age setting. The centre is located in the central business district of Taupo and is owned by Kidicorp Ltd. This is the first Education Review of the centre, which opened in February 2012.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 50 children. The current roll is 88, of whom 31 are MƒÅori and predominantly identified with NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa iwi.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy emphasises support for children to become independent and self-managing learners, the promotion of positive relationships with families and whƒÅnau, and valuing the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua. Good progress has been made over a relatively short period in ensuring this philosophy is reflected at all levels of centre operations.</p><p>Management and leadership has remained stable since the centre opened. The percentage of qualified staff is greater than required expectations.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the implementation of effective self review and focus on continuous improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers at Heuheu St Community Kindy provide consistently high-quality practice to support children‚Äôs education and care. This is evident through:</p><ul>
<li>the maintenance of positive relationships between and amongst children and adults that are respectful, caring and responsive</li>
<li>intentional and considered planning and assessment that is derived from children‚Äôs strengths and interests, and extends their learning</li>
<li>the integration of MƒÅori cultural perspectives, relevant to the local context</li>
<li>the development of an environment that is attractively presented, and provides children with ready access to a wide variety of equipment and materials for learning and play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers receive good quality support, reflect on and receive constructive feedback about their practices. They benefit from many opportunities to participate in relevant and ongoing professional learning.</p><p>Children experience an extensive curriculum that is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum) and links to the competencies and behaviours promoted in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> for schools. The language, culture and identities of individual children and their families is highly valued and well reflected in the curriculum. This is supported by regular consultation with parents about their aspirations for their children.</p><p>Children are confident and competent learners. Centre routines enable them to make choices, experience challenge, explore and sustain their play in groups or as individuals. Children enjoy learning alongside teachers through conversations that extend their thinking and problem solving skills. Effective use is made of the local community to enhance children‚Äôs understanding of the wider world.</p><p>Significant features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>a thorough induction process that promotes full participation of whƒÅnau, care-givers and children</li>
<li>the ‚ÄòBe School Ready‚Äô approach that integrates literacy and numeracy learning throughout the programme and includes well-planned transitions to school.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager is providing highly effective professional leadership. She works in a strong professional partnership with a skilled, knowledgeable and experienced Kidicorp area manager. Effective leadership is contributing to the development of a cooperative and cohesive teaching team, who are focussed on the provision of a quality education and care service for children and their families.</p><p>Kidicorp Ltd. provides strong governance and management support, including well-developed and rigorous quality assurance processes, as well as administrative and business support by well-qualified, experienced personnel.</p><p>The operation of the centre is underpinned by a well-understood, shared vision, philosophy and strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that important priorities for ongoing development are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance the environment and programme to add complexity to children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>strengthen teacher knowledge and confidence in the use of te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori practices.</li>
</ul><p>Further development in these areas should help the centre to fully realise its philosophy and vision.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Heuheu St Community Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Heuheu St Community Kindy will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
