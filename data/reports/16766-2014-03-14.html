</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Horahora Playcentre is a small urban service situated within the grounds of the Horahora School. Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre caters for children from birth to school age and is open for a family session one day a week. The centre is licensed for nineteen children and has a current role of six children.</p><p>At the time of the 2009 ERO report, twenty-eight children were enrolled at the centre and sessions were held four days a week. Over the past three years the centre has found it difficult to attract and keep members. Currently membership training levels are low. Since the 2009 ERO report the centre has been relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations. Very recently several visitors have shown an interest in the centre and centre leaders believe membership will grow.</p><p>The 2009 ERO report recommended that centre members develop programmes focussed on further extending children‚Äôs emerging interests. The report also recommended that members continue to promote course training, encourage emerging leadership and continue to refine self-review. Centre members continue work to address these recommendations.</p><p>The playcentre operates as part of the Northland Playcentre Association. The association is the umbrella organisation for twenty-three centres, covering a wide geographical area. Many of these centres are rural or semi-rural with a high turnover of membership. The association manages and distributes centre funding and provides a training programme for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve playcentre qualifications. It also has systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The association support workers carry out the administrative workload for its members. They have reviewed ways to make courses more manageable and accessible for centre members and have implemented a ‚Äòcourse two in a term‚Äô initiative.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Northland Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Horahora Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Although the playcentre has a very transient membership, the centre president has worked hard, with association support, to keep the centre open over the last three years. Most members are new to the centre and are still becoming familiar with playcentre expectations and philosophy for working with children.</p><p>Children play alongside their parents, exploring a range of activities provided. They use the library to read together. Some children approach other children and are beginning to play cooperatively. An attractive, well maintained outdoor area provides children with opportunities to be physically active.</p><p>Centre members have recently elected a new president, secretary and treasurer. As they develop their knowledge of their roles, the centre support worker should be able to focus more of her time on modelling effective ways of working with children for centre members.</p><p>The association provides a basic framework to guide centre operations and offers training opportunities for parents and caregivers of children attending its centres. Strategic and annual plans are in place. Centre members could now consider ways to strengthen these to include measurable, achievable, improvement focussed goals, together with timelines and details about how these plans will be achieved over time.</p><p>Commitment to promoting a bicultural partnership with MƒÅori whƒÅnau is evident in the Northland Playcentre Association policies and procedures. The association has developed Te Roopu Whakaaro Kotahi as a forum to support whƒÅnau MƒÅori in playcentres. However, bicultural practices need to be further strengthened. The New Zealand Playcentre Federation‚Äôs Te Tiriti O Waitangi framework could be used to promote ongoing development if Association support is to impact authentically on bicultural practices in Northland Association Playcentres.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that in order to better provide positive learning outcomes for children, they should work with the association to:</p><ul>
<li>support newer centre members in the implementation of the playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>grow the leadership and management skills of centre members</li>
<li>develop effective child-focussed planning, assessment and evaluation processes that focus on extending children‚Äôs interests and learning</li>
</ul><p>develop a culture of ongoing self review to improve the quality of the programme.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Northland Playcentre Association continues to work closely with Horahora Playcentre members to support existing members and attract and retain new members.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Horahora Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Horahora Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
