</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukeko Corner Kindergarten is a privately owned and family operated early childhood centre located in Katikati. It is licensed for 29 children over the age of two. Currently there are 41 children enrolled which is a significant increase since the previous ERO review in 2012. Four children are of MƒÅori descent. The kindergarten provides education and care for children from diverse cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers are well qualified and experienced. The centre manager is committed to responding to the language, culture and identity of all the children and families attending. She has recently employed a teacher who is of Ngai Tamawhariua descent, which is the local hap≈´. This teacher brings knowledge and skills in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. This will enrich and deepen learning about local tribal history and te ao MƒÅori for teachers, children and their families. In addition, part time teachers have been employed to respond to the language and culture of children of Tongan descent.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, the centre has made progress and improved aspects of the teacher appraisal system and self review. This has led to systematic development and improvement in centre operations.</p><p>The centre's Christian values of respect and kindness are highly evident and underpin its philosophy of community involvement, service in the community, and children learning through meaningful contexts as they play.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have many opportunities to express their ideas and opinions, follow their interests and sustain their play. They are developing high levels of social and creative skills as they work and play in a mixed age setting. Children are supported to make choices. They can freely access a wide variety of high-quality equipment and materials in a well designed home-like setting.</p><p>Children are benefitting from the extensive knowledge that individual teachers bring to enrich the programme, most notably in the creative arts, natural science, MƒÅori and Tongan culture.</p><p>Children are also benefitting from the close, reciprocal and meaningful relationship that the centre manager and teachers have developed over time with the local hap≈´. Flexible routines and regular cultural celebrations and events contribute to a strong sense of belonging for children and families.</p><p>Regular trips and excursions into the local community are an important part of the centre programme. This includes close relationships with the nearby primary school and a local retirement home.</p><p>Children who have special needs experience an inclusive environment and benefit from a strong partnership between teachers, specialist agencies and families.</p><p>Well planned transitions into the centre and on to primary school are appreciated by families and contribute to children's confidence and well being.</p><p>High quality teaching practices observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>positive, nurturing and reciprocal relationships that have been established and maintained amongst teachers, children and families, whƒÅnau and fono.</li>
<li>complex learning conversations with children that promote their thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>skilful integration of literacy and mathematics into children's play</li>
<li>teachers' planning well to add complexity to children's learning</li>
<li>a commitment to ensuring that children from Indian, Tongan and other backgrounds experience a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>There is a good balance between teacher led and child initiated learning. Teachers highly value children's contributions, listen carefully to their ideas and questions, and use these to underpin their planning.</p><p>The centre manager promotes a culture of shared leadership. This is evident because:</p><ul>
<li>staff feel valued and listened to</li>
<li>leadership seeks parent input and responds to their ideas</li>
<li>responsibilities are distributed across all staff in a way that makes good use of individual strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Good governance and management means that the centre is well placed to sustain its performance and promote positive outcomes for all children. A clear and regularly reviewed philosophy underpins centre operations. There is appropriate strategic and annual planning. This is increasingly useful in guiding centre development. Self review is well understood, ongoing and systematic and leads to improvement in centre practices and the environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are committed to increasing their bicultural knowledge and practice. Useful next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing teachers' confidence and capability so that they can make more frequent daily use of MƒÅori language</li>
<li>deepening teachers understanding of MƒÅori preferred ways of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders and teachers acknowledge that assessment should be strengthened. A stronger focus on ensuring learning informs planning could help to extend that learning in a systematic way. This will include enhanced systems for monitoring and tracking.</p><p>The centre manager needs to continue to strengthen teacher appraisal by ensuring it is clearly linked to the Practicing Teacher Criteria and shared and agreed best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Making more effective use of Ministry of Education resources, indicators and guidelines of best practice is likely to bring greater clarity and understanding to these reviews.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukeko Corner Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukeko Corner Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>28 August 2015</p><div>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>

<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
