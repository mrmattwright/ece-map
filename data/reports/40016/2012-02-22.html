<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Otumoetai Playcentre caters for children from birth to school age and is situated in the Tauranga suburb of Otumoetai. The centre is a parent-led cooperative and operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. At the time of this ERO review there were 95 children enrolled of whom 17 identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Otumoetai Playcentre has recently celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary and there is a new team of office holders including two co-presidents, two vice-presidents and a personnel officer. In July the centre was relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. The centre also operates a programme for first-time parents and babies.</p><p align="left">Since the last ERO review centre members have made some progress in relation to the recommendations identified in the 2005 report, particularly in regard to session evaluations and strategic planning. Over the past year, the centre has benefited from administrative support and professional development provided by the association and facilitated by the New Zealand Playcentre federation.</p><p align="left">Parents ask open-ended questions and use rich learning conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Support for children&rsquo;s developing literacy and numeracy skills is an important part of daily experiences and is successfully encouraged through a range of play contexts. Children&rsquo;s individual profiles provide parents with information about learning and the activities children were involved in during their time at the playcentre. Children are engaged in meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences.</p><p align="left">Positive and affirming interactions between parents and children contribute to a settled inclusive environment. Children participate in sustained individual and group learning experiences. The mixed-age group plays harmoniously together. Children are secure and happy, and demonstrate a sense of well-being and belonging.</p><p align="left">Centre members work collaboratively to successfully operate the centre. Centre office holders recognise that formalising self-review processes and further strengthening the M&#257;ori dimension are areas for continued development.</p><p align="left">An appropriate range of policies and procedures contributes to the emotional and physical well-being of children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Otumoetai Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Otumoetai Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Otumoetai Playcentre has recently celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary and there is a new team of office holders, including two co-presidents, two vice-presidents and a personnel officer. The smooth operation of the playcentre, and the quality of the programme have been sustained through these changes.</p><p align="left">The playcentre aims to provide children with a high-interest self-choice programme that incorporates the sixteen playcentre areas of play. The centre has benefited from the centre administration support worker over the past year and the professional development provided by the playcentre federation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Programme provision:</b> The programme is a good balance of free-choice play and structured group times and routines. Parents ask open-ended questions and use rich learning conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking. They communicate well with one another during sessions and children are well supervised. Support for children&rsquo;s developing literacy and numeracy skills is an important part of daily experiences and is successfully encouraged through a range of play contexts. Children&rsquo;s individual profiles provide parents with information about learning and the activities children were involved in during their time at the playcentre. Children are engaged in meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences.</p><p align="left"><b>Learning environment</b><b>:</b> The environment successfully promotes children&rsquo;s learning and development. I<span>nviting play spaces and an appropriate range of high-quality equipment and materials are easily accessible to children. Resources cater for the mixed-age group and are used in open-ended and creative ways</span>. Well-organised <span>areas facilitate children&rsquo;s ongoing learning.</span> Children have a variety of opportunities to develop play and exploration within a supportive and nurturing atmosphere.</p><p align="left"><b>Interactions:</b> Positive and supportive interactions are a feature of the centre and children are able to play in a mixed-age setting, enabling them to enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. Parents respond to children&rsquo;s requests promptly. They promote social skills through constant recognition and reinforcement of children&rsquo;s good behaviour. A strong commitment to working cooperatively is evident. Children confidently and happily approach parents for support or to share their play activities.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left"><b>Curriculum review</b><b>:</b> <span>The next step for the playcentre is to develop a formal system for reviewing all aspects of the centre operations. This process should enable members to analyse and reflect on their practices to further improve learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p align="left"><b>M&#257;ori dimension:</b> Consideration should be given to further strengthening the M&#257;ori dimension, particularly opportunities to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori as a meaningful and functional language.</p><p align="left">Attention to these aspects of centre operation is likely to strengthen the quality of the programme and learning for children.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><p align="left">Otumoetai Playcentre provides inclusive early childhood education for all children including children with special needs. Centre office holders encourage parents to visit prior to their child&rsquo;s enrolment and talk about the child&rsquo;s strengths, interests and whether they have any concerns about their child&rsquo;s development or needs. Routines are individualised to meet children&rsquo;s needs. Children with special needs are welcomed as individuals who bring strengths and interests into the playcentre.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Otumoetai Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-otumoetai-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Otumoetai Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Otumoetai Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Otumoetai Playcentre caters for children from birth to school age and is situated in the Tauranga suburb of Otumoetai. The centre is a parent-led cooperative and operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. At the time of this ERO review there were 95 children enrolled of whom 17 identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Otumoetai Playcentre has recently celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary and there is a new team of office holders including two co-presidents, two vice-presidents and a personnel officer. In July the centre was relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. The centre also operates a programme for first-time parents and babies.</p><p align="left">Since the last ERO review centre members have made some progress in relation to the recommendations identified in the 2005 report, particularly in regard to session evaluations and strategic planning. Over the past year, the centre has benefited from administrative support and professional development provided by the association and facilitated by the New Zealand Playcentre federation.</p><p align="left">Parents ask open-ended questions and use rich learning conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Support for children&rsquo;s developing literacy and numeracy skills is an important part of daily experiences and is successfully encouraged through a range of play contexts. Children&rsquo;s individual profiles provide parents with information about learning and the activities children were involved in during their time at the playcentre. Children are engaged in meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences.</p><p align="left">Positive and affirming interactions between parents and children contribute to a settled inclusive environment. Children participate in sustained individual and group learning experiences. The mixed-age group plays harmoniously together. Children are secure and happy, and demonstrate a sense of well-being and belonging.</p><p align="left">Centre members work collaboratively to successfully operate the centre. Centre office holders recognise that formalising self-review processes and further strengthening the M&#257;ori dimension are areas for continued development.</p><p align="left">An appropriate range of policies and procedures contributes to the emotional and physical well-being of children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p></html>
