</table><p>The Ridge Childcare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Ridge Childcare is a privately-owned service that is licensed for 70 children, including 14 aged under two years. Approximately 10 percent of the children enrolled have MƒÅori heritage.</p><p>ERO's 2017 report identified that governance systems, curriculum and teaching practices required further development. The Ministry of Education has provided support to build leaders' and teachers' ability and understanding in these areas.</p><p>There have been staffing changes, and considerable property development and refurbishment over the past two years. A new head teacher was employed in 2018 and works alongside the centre manager. Most of the teachers are qualified and registered. The staff also includes an administrator and a chef.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The head teacher provides good professional leadership. Teachers are developing shared understandings and working together to improve the curriculum. Children have opportunities to explore resources, make decisions, and to be involved in experiences alongside their friends. Teachers know children and support their play well. Infants and toddlers are settled and have positive relationships with adults. Good networks have been established with local schools to help children transition into a new setting.</p><p>Wall displays show that the curriculum includes opportunities for children to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. There is some inclusion of te reo MƒÅori in routines such as kai time and group time. Some teachers have participated in professional development to improve their understanding of te ao MƒÅori. Teachers now need to ensure that this new learning is evident in their ongoing daily teaching practice.</p><p>Teachers document children's learning and experiences at the centre as individuals and in groups. They could strengthen assessment records by writing clear next steps that show how they plan to extend learning for each child over time. Regularly inviting parents/whƒÅnau to share their knowledge and aspirations for their children will enhance current processes.</p><p>Through external support and guidance, a review of governance practices has contributed to improved systems. A long-term plan and a teacher appraisal process have been established. These developments are relatively new. Managers and teachers should continue to build on these positive changes. This should include the head teacher documenting feedback to teachers about their practice. Appraising the performance of the centre manager and head teacher should be a priority.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to consolidate new curriculum practices and governance systems. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers reviewing how well the curriculum and teaching practices for all age groups reflect the service's philosophy and align with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers improving their understanding of tikanga MƒÅori and integration of te reo MƒÅori to support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers continuing to improve assessment and planning processes, and evaluating how well teaching practices contribute to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all staff evaluating how well long-term and annual goals are being progressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all staff monitoring health and safety systems to ensure licensing requirements are met.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Ridge Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified non-compliance relating to teacher appraisal as well as some health and safety practices. To address these, the service provider should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all staff undertake a system of regular appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the evaluation of emergency drills informs the annual review of the service's emergency plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accident records are analysed to identify hazards and appropriate action is taken.<br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Services 2008</em>; <em>GMA7, HS8,12</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO requested the service provider developed an action plan to show how the priorities for improvement identified in this report, will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates against the action plan.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>18 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
