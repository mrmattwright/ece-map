</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Waimauku Kindergarten is located in a semi-rural community in West Auckland. Four qualified teachers provide sessional and full day education and care for up to 40 local children over two years of age. Twenty two percent of children enrolled are MƒÅori.</p>
<p>The kindergarten operates under the guidance of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association (NAKA). The Association provides the kindergarten with a framework of policies and procedures. A Teacher Services Manager regularly visits the kindergarten and offers the team useful professional support and guidance.</p>
<p>The 2012 ERO report highlighted the strengths of the kindergarten as having a child centred programme supported by quality teaching, stimulating environments and effective partnerships with families. Leadership and self review were also effective. Areas for development were programme planning and documentation for individual children, and increasing the use of whƒÅnau contribution in portfolios. The teaching team has responded very positively to these suggestions.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are active, confident learners and communicators. They have trusting, respectful relationships with adults and play co-operatively together. The thoughtfully resourced, attractive and spacious environment allows children to follow their interests, and be truly creative. Children display a real sense of belonging in the kindergarten environment.</p>
<p>Positive relationships with parents/whƒÅnau are valued by the teaching team. Teachers are responsive to parent aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning and to their feedback. Good opportunities are provided for parents to learn about effective early childhood education. Interesting quotations scattered throughout children‚Äôs portfolios and the environment link the programme to history‚Äôs great educators.</p>
<p>The high quality learning environment and teaching practices provide authentic opportunities for children to engage in both oral and written literacy. Science and mathematics also feature strongly. Children have good opportunities to explore the use of information and communication technologies through the use of iPads.</p>
<p>Programme planning processes are highly effective. Programmes are very responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities. Individual learning stories highlight the value placed on literacy, creativity and family and community. Links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are meaningful for parents.</p>
<p>Teaching practices are highly successful in promoting positive outcomes for children. Teachers work alongside children, and are sensitive and responsive to children‚Äôs requests. Their shared understandings of effective teaching practices promote children‚Äôs initiative, problem solving and social skills. They support children to be leaders in their own learning and that of others.</p>
<p>Scholarship money accessed through the association has supported the development of a relevant bicultural curriculum. A tutor of MƒÅori currently attends one session per week, working alongside children and teachers. This opportunity has enabled teachers to model themselves as learners and to promote understandings of te ao MƒÅori in authentic ways throughout the kindergarten.</p>
<p>NAKA provides good access to professional development. Appraisal processes have recently been reviewed and improved. The well led teaching team is open to rigorous discussion around centre practices and strategic direction. Self review is well used to identify successes and needs and enables teachers to improve their practice, systems and environments.</p>
<p>The team has acknowledged that it is timely to review their philosophy statement to align better with current practice and to consider identifying outcomes for children in their self-review findings.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waimauku Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Waimauku Kindergarten will be in four years.</p>

<p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p>
<p>13 April 2015</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
