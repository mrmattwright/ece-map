</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Timatatanga o te Matauranga is situated next to Otangarei Primary School, in Whangarei. It offers school-day sessions and caters for up to 30 children from two years to school age.</p><p>The kindergarten provides learning and teaching from a bicultural perspective for its predominantly MƒÅori community, recognising the gifts, talents and strengths of children‚Äôs family and whƒÅnau. Equity funding received by the centre is used to provide hot lunches and healthy food snacks for tamariki throughout the day.</p><p>Te Timatatanga o te Matauranga operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association which provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. The association also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from a professional practice manager (PPM).</p><p>Since the centre‚Äôs 2011 ERO report, teachers have continued to refine their planning processes and have worked to ensure te reo MƒÅori is used more consistently within the teaching and learning programme provided for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy their time at the centre. They show a strong sense of belonging and form strong friendships with other tamariki. Positive child-teacher relationships create a foundation for nurturing children‚Äôs learning and social skills. Children have many opportunities to explore their environment and play with other children.</p><p>Connections to children‚Äôs culture and home and family life are used to guide teachers‚Äô planning and make children‚Äôs learning meaningful. Partnerships with whƒÅnau are important and valued by teachers. Parents are regularly consulted about their tamariki‚Äôs welfare and learning, and about planning for various centre projects.</p><p>The head teacher models quality teaching. She continues to build a collaborative teaching team through trusting relationships. Teachers have multiple opportunities to lead, share ownership of the programme and work together as a team. Teachers integrate literacy and mathematics meaningfully into the kindergarten‚Äôs programme. They include tikanga and te reo MƒÅori in the programme, using support from external advisers to develop their knowledge and skills in these areas. The use of child-led activity based storytelling is also used very effectively to link language, identity and meaning back to MƒÅori culture.</p><p>Assessment portfolios are used to maintain records of children‚Äôs time in the centre. Children enjoy reading their portfolios and sharing these records of their progress and achievements with others. Parents are encouraged to contribute to their child‚Äôs learning by adding their comments to their portfolio.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy is developed in consultation with the parent community, and guides its daily operations and programme directions. Teachers frequently refer to this philosophy when evaluating teaching and learning programmes.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs PPM is highly focussed on ensuring there is good professional support and development for staff at Te Timatatanga o Te Matauranga. Teachers are given opportunities to grow their leadership and teaching capabilities. The PPM appreciates the uniqueness of the kindergarten and its teaching team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve practice ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing teaching strategies to strengthen the focus placed on children as capable and competent learners</li>
<li>using open ended questions to further promote and support the development of children‚Äôs thinking skills and abilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Timatatanga o te Matauranga completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Timatatanga o te Matauranga will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>29 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
