</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Au Pair Link Wellington 2 is one of two networks in Wellington, operated by the national early childhood organisation Au Pair Link. There are fourteen licensed networks across New Zealand. The organisation recruits au pairs (educators) from overseas to work with young children in their homes, usually for a maximum term of one year. Through the recruitment process, families choose an educator who they think is going to meet the needs of their children. Building strong, secure relationships between families and educators is a high priority for the organisation.</p><p>The network is licensed for 80 children, including up to 80 aged up to two years. The roll at the time of the review was 31, with five identifying as Māori.</p><p>All programme managers are fully qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>Au Pair Link has responded positively to the findings in the November 2014 ERO report. These included: using self review to inquire into the effectiveness of practices in promoting positive outcomes for children; and exploring ways to increase participation of Māori whānau and Pacific families in the service.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three in the Au Pair Link organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Au Pair Link provides high quality education and care. Well aligned, robust systems and processes, including quality assurance, monitoring of practice, effective leadership and systematic internal evaluation contribute to improvement, sustainability and positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>There is a strong commitment to the philosophy at all levels of the organisation. A focus on high quality care and education in children's own homes and positive learning outcomes is highly evident.</p><p>The service values the importance of children learning through play. Children are introduced to a wide range of learning experiences within and outside the home. Well considered, high quality resources and regular excursions further enhance these opportunities. <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, strongly underpins the service's curriculum.</p><p>Educators undertake a comprehensive induction process. This includes support to develop an understanding of <em>Te Whāriki, </em>children's learning dispositions and bicultural practices.</p><p>The programme manager provides comprehensive support for educators in the home and through regular service playgroups. This includes coaching and guidance to effectively model ways to plan children's learning and identify next learning steps. Children's progress is captured and celebrated by educators in photos and stories. Parents' contribution to the programme is highly valued. Assessment practices successfully supports continuity in learning and demonstrates children's progress in a range of contexts.</p><p>Many children in the service are infants and toddlers. The placement of educators is well considered and responsive to the needs of individual children and their families. The programme manager works positively alongside educators to provide a curriculum that effectively supports infants and toddlers.</p><p>Through the recruitment process, provision for children with additional learning needs is carefully considered. The programme manager effectively works alongside educators, families and external agencies to promotethe participation and engagement of these children in the learning programme.</p><p>The strategic plan effectively guides direction for the service. Goals are clearly linked to outcomes for children. Au Pair Link has identified the need to increase the participation of Māori and Pacific families. Since the November 2014 ERO report, this has occurred and continues to be a priority.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management has identified, and ERO's evaluation affirms, the need to continue to strengthen participation of Māori and Pacific families.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Au Pair Link Wellington 2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Au Pair Link Wellington 2 will be in four years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>30 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
