</table><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of the programme learning environment and consistency in teaching.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Antarctica Early Learning School (Owhata Rd) - (AELS) is a new early childhood service located in an eastern suburb of Rotorua. The service provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age. At the time of this ERO review 27 of the 44 children enrolled were of Māori descent. The centre is one of three owned by AELS Limited, a Hamilton based company.</p><p>The centre receives equity funding and uses this to support children’s participation in early childhood care and education. </p><p>The centre is organised by age groups. One area caters for children up to two years and the other area for children over two years. Each area has a head teacher who is responsible for the programmes and day-to-day running of the centre. The co-owner/centre manager, through regular visits to the centre, provides direction and support for centre operations and teachers’ practice.</p><p>The AELS philosophy aims 'to provide fun, interactive, quality educational learning'. There is an emphasis on early literacy, numeracy, computer technology and a focus on diverse languages and cultural experiences.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre owners have developed an over-arching philosophy and staff are beginning to consider this philosophy and what it means for teacher practice, leadership and governance. The centre manager acknowledges the need to review this philosophy in consultation with teachers and parents to create a shared understanding and ensure parent aspirations are reflected in the centre programme.</p><p>Teachers appreciate opportunities to reflect on their practice, and discuss their next steps and goals with the centre manager. Regular appraisal meetings provide constructive feedback and help to set expectations for this new teaching team.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a genuine interest in, and love for the children they work with. Māori staff play a significant role in affirming mokopuna Māori in their culture, language and identity. They make good use of outings in the community to extend opportunities for learning, and for children to make connections with the wider community. This includes close links and positive transitions to a local primary school. Teachers plan to extend their relationship with other schools in the area.</p><p>Teachers value their relationships with parents and whānau. These relationships are supported through a range of communication strategies including newsletters, Facebook and day-to-day interactions. Teachers have worked hard to produce attractive assessment profiles for children. Parents and children value opportunities to share these books at the centre, at home and with whānau.</p><p>Children and families benefit from opportunities to access specialist services that include hearing, vision and speech, within the centre complex.</p><p>The centre owners and ERO agree that they now need to work on the next steps and areas of non-compliance outlined in this report to ensure they provide quality care and education for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre owners acknowledge the need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a strategic plan focused on improving centre operations and outcomes for children that is aligned to teacher appraisal and links to professional development and self review</li>
<li>provide a learning environment and curriculum that consistently reflects the principles, strands and goals of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and the holistic way that children learn.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Antarctica Early Learning School (Owhata Rd) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for Compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>providing a language rich environment that supports children’s learning</li>
<li>supporting children’s developing social competence and understanding of appropriate behaviours</li>
<li>teachers’ developing effective strategies to ensure children’s emotional and physical wellbeing</li>
<li>strengthening teachers’ understanding of children’s learning, development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008] </em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develop a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Antarctica Early Learning School (Owhata Rd) will be within two years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
