</table><p>The centre requires external support to continue to improve the quality of the programmes for children, and to meet the requirements of the Education Council and the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care 2008.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>YMCA Early Learning Centre Ellerslie is one of five centres under the umbrella of YMCA of Auckland Inc. Early in 2018, the service's group manager, early learning services, left her position. At the time of this ERO review the position remains vacant. The review of three centres has identified significant areas for development.</p><p>YMCA Early Learning Centre Ellerslie provides both sessional and full-day options for children and whƒÅnau. The service can cater for up to 30 children in a mixed-age setting. It operates in the YMCA Recreation Centre. Families come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. Most of the teachers are qualified. Some have not yet reached full registration as practising teachers. The YMCA provides a framework of policies, procedures and documentation to guide operations. The centre is led by a relieving centre manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the YMCA of Auckland Inc organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers greet children and their whƒÅnau warmly on arrival. They know children and whƒÅnau well and converse with whƒÅnau to strengthen partnerships. Teachers are calm, positive and encouraging with children and provide very good care. Children settle quickly and play well with their peers. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident, and this particularly supports the youngest children and those with additional needs.</p><p>Teachers respond to children's initiatives and encourage child-led play. The environment is attractive and resources are generally good quality and plentiful.</p><p>Children participate in a number of activities outside the centre during the week, making links with the local community and experiencing other spaces. It is important for teachers to now evaluate the outcome of these excursions for children. This would help to shape and inform their planning.</p><p>Bicultural understanding and knowledge is growing in the centre. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori with children and they respond appropriately. Resources reflect the bicultural heritage of New Zealand, and displays celebrate the language.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and value whƒÅnau input into their children's learning and the life of the centre. WhƒÅnau are confident to share information about their cultures and home experiences. Centre staff assist and support whƒÅnau in a number of ways to manage day-to-day challenges.</p><p>The relieving centre manager has initiated a number of positive changes in a short period. She has begun the process of building staff understanding of the revised early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Discussions amongst staff are helping teachers to become more confident to use this document's principles and strands. The centre manager encourages teachers to use the limited space in the centre as effectively as possible and to improve their practice. The impermanence and limited direction she has regarding her role has, she reports, hampered her making other positive changes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Systems and practices requiring improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing more focused internal evaluation to gauge the quality of teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing and supporting teachers' understanding about effective assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a plan to outline centre goals and aims for teachers' work with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing appraisals for teachers that are focused on improved outcomes for children and are aligned to Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of YMCA Early Learning Centre Ellerslie completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management by YMCA of Auckland Inc. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide appraisal systems that reflect the requirements of the Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide leadership training for teachers, especially centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor and evaluate teaching and learning practices to meet the requirements of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> and the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a strategic plan to guide its early childhood services.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 47(1) (a), (b) (ii), (c) (i), (e), Regulation 43, (1) (a), (i), (iii), (iv), (vi), (b), C1, C2, C3, C4,C6, C11, PF13.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of YMCA Early Learning Centre Ellerslie will be within two years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>23 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
