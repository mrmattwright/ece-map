</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children's Corner Howick is a privately owned centre in Howick, Auckland that provides education and care for up to 34 children from two to five years of age. The majority of children attending are from the local community and some have had older siblings that have previously attended the centre.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified some good practices that have been maintained. Areas for development focused on strategies to strengthen assessment, planning and self review.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2012 review, there have been changes to staff and a new team is in place. The centre manager and owner have both provided continuity in personnel for the centre, and their commitment to providing high quality Montessori education and care continues. Teachers are all qualified and registered and continue to be involved in professional development.</p><p>The centre’s Montessori philosophy together with aspects of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, inform the programme and teaching practices. The philosophy focuses on fostering children's confidence and independence as socially engaged members of their community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have fun and play cooperatively in a positive and supportive environment. They have very good access to outside learning experiences. Children approach teachers with trust and affection when requiring reassurance or assistance. They are settled, happy, and show respect for others.</p><p>Teachers show in-depth knowledge of the Montessori philosophy. Children's physical, emotional and social development is nurtured. Teachers unobtrusively support children to engage in activities and develop friendships. They have high expectations and view all children as competent learners. Teachers provide an inclusive programme for all children, catering for their varying abilities and stages of development, and maintaining the dignity of the child at all times. They provide good support for children’s oral language development.</p><p>Respectful and responsive relationships underpin the strong sense of community at the centre. Teachers value partnerships with parents and share information about children's learning. Frequent communication with parents ensures they are well informed about their child’s/children's progress.</p><p>Teachers recognise the place that Māori have as tāngata whenua and are increasingly using te reo in appropriate ways. They plan to continue developing their knowledge of tikanga and te reo Māori. Teachers encourage children to share their home languages and affirm children’s cultural identities.</p><p>Children are purposefully engaged in activities and explore at their own pace. They are developing a sense of personal and social responsibility. Support for children to have a smooth transition to school is a much valued feature of the centre.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families very well. They interact with children in ways that are affirming and responsive to children’s ideas. Teachers encourage children to make choices and problem solve. They include aspects of literacy, mathematics and science in the programme in meaningful ways.</p><p>The centre owner is actively involved in the centre and is supportive of the teachers. The centre manager provides strong professional leadership. Teachers are developing collaborative approaches to their work. They are enthusiastic about professional development and about contributing to centre self review. Better documentation of their thinking about the effectiveness of their teaching practice would help teachers to identify and develop strategies for promoting ongoing improvement in teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>re-establishing a documented process of assessment, planning and evaluation that more consistently records how teachers extend children’s thinking and shows how their individual interests are developed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a more evaluative process of self review that involves deeper analysis and collaboration and focuses on effectiveness in improving educational outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>making the links between <em>Te Whāriki</em> and the Montessori philosophy more visible to the parent community</li>
<li>further strengthening bicultural practices, including the use of <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners,</em> in teacher appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Children's Corner Howick completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Children's Corner Howick will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
