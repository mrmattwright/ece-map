</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rapanui Brunswick Playcentre is one of four parent-led services under the umbrella of the Wanganui Playcentre Association (the association). It is in a rural setting on the outskirts of Whanganui. It is licensed for up to 30 children, including 15 aged up to two years. Nineteen children are enrolled and one is MƒÅori. The centre opens for mixed-age sessions three mornings a week.</p><p>The association president and office holders, along with a delegate from each playcentre, form the governance group (executive) for the association. The executive provides general guidance and support for members including: leadership for strategic planning; financial management; policy development; and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment.</p><p>A support person, employed by the association, visits each centre and provides professional advice and feedback to strengthen members' practice and promote improvement. In 2016, support from other associations has been sought and professional learning and development (PLD) accessed to strengthen operation, through the Playcentre Federation.</p><p>Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. At Rapanui Brunswick Playcentre two sessions are facilitated by one employed, teacher-trained coordinator who supports parents and whƒÅnau to develop and implement the daily programme and manage administration requirements. There is another session which is parent-led.</p><p>At the time of this review there are several members who have supported the centre over a period of time. There is an emphasis on strengthening members' participation in the training programme.</p><p>The April 2014 ERO report, identified the need to support members‚Äô understanding and use of self review, annual and strategic planning, te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and planning for learning. Securing fixtures and fittings was required. The association needed to implement appraisal processes to support the developmental needs of the centre members. Progress is evident.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four education reviews in the Wanganui Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning is based on the playcentre philosophy and principles of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The focus is on: whƒÅnau ta ngƒÅ ta, a sense of family and wider whƒÅnau connections; whakamana, upholding individual prestige; ngƒÅ honongƒÅ, respectful relationships; and kotahitanga, using all the senses.</p><p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau know each other well. Warmth and enthusiasm is evident. This is conveyed by their strong sense of belonging. Local community links are valued and affirmed. Long term connections across the centre and association underpin a cohesive approach to ensuring children are settled, engaged and confident learners. This is supported by high ratios of adults to children.</p><p>Adults provide a programme that fosters children's creativity. Art, science and physical activities are responsive to children's interests and strengths. The curriculum is anchored in literacy and mathematics. Local excursions provide children with rich learning opportunities. Children joyfully use resources to learn. They are viewed as confident and independent, able to exercise choice and celebrate learning as fun.</p><p>Children are fully engaged in the programme. Social competencies are nurtured through tuakana teina relationships, where younger children are well supported by others. Infants and toddlers enjoy a range of resources responsive to their interests and strengths.</p><p>Parents/adults continue to grow their confidence in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Karakia and waiata are woven through centre routines and aspects of play. The environment includes some signposts of kupu MƒÅori, natural resources and visual representation of te ao MƒÅori. Acknowledgement of local MƒÅori history through planning and use of resources should be considered. Centre members identify the need to build te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori capability. Adults should continue to strengthen and promote children's culture, language and identity through the profiles.</p><p>Portfolio narratives by parents, include children's art work, interests over time and some child voice. Individual entries include some learning outcomes based on <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>. Parent aspirations contribute to planning and provide important links between home and centre.</p><p>A newly implemented process for assessment, planning and evaluation promotes adults to notice, recognise and respond to children's interests and prior learning. Strategies to observe children in everyday activities are in place to build a picture of what children know, understand, feel and do. A shared knowledge and consistent approach to adding complexity, progress over time and articulating outcomes for children, should strengthen centre practices. Alignment of the session selfevaluation with the planning and assessment should further inform parents' understanding of children's learning.</p><p>A transition process is in place with two local school. Children are invited to participate in pet days and classroom visits. Sharing each child's early childhood experiences through portfolios with the school should generate understandings of the individual child and the centre.</p><p>Some self review is evident. Recent self review focused on how to better welcome and inform new members. Elements of internal evaluation included a clear framework, a focus question, indicators, a survey and reflective input by members. Improving internal evaluation is a next step.</p><p>The coordinator provides experienced leadership for members and an improved level of support from the association is evident. The redefined administrative role has resulted in a more systematic approach to aspects of operation such as financial management, policy review, and communication. As the association develops new policies, in line with recent legislation, there is a need to communicate why these are relevant and how these are to be incorporated into practice at centre level.</p><p>While the employment of the teacher-trained coordinator is ensuring that requirements for government funding are met, the association's drive to enable group supervision of sessions, when realised, should better reflect the philosophy.</p><p>An appraisal process for employees is in the early stages of implementation. The approach needs to be significantly strengthened, particularly if it is to provide effective support for the development of the coordinator and meet Education Council requirements for the future endorsement of Practising Teacher Certificates.</p><p>To build sustainability and shared understanding of practice and operation, the association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give priority to supporting leadership and teamwork at centre level, including ensuring that guidelines are understood, kept up to date and relevant; and that appropriate succession planning and office holder induction are in place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>introduce a more strategic and formalised approach to the centre support worker role linked to centre needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure centre long-term planning, reporting and review processes are adequate to effectively inform decisions made by the association about priorities for development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association should continue to provide support for the centre to effectively implement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning for learning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process for the coordinator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthened provision for older children, including support for the transition to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based practices, through strengthening te ao MƒÅori knowledges and understandings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practices that support sustainability of operation.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rapanui Brunswick Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rapanui Brunswick Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 February 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
