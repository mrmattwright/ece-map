</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Over the Rainbow Early Learning Centre is located in central Pukekohe and provides education and care for children from infancy to school age in a mixed-age setting. Parents are able to choose from either sessional or all-day care options. The centre is licensed to cater for 34 children including six up to the age of two years. At the time of the review, there were 48 children enrolled, including 12 Māori and four from Pacific Island children.</p><p>The centre owner and licensee is also the centre manager. A head teacher takes responsibility for the day-to-day organisation of the centre. Two teachers oversee the care and learning of children up to two years old. There have been several changes to teaching staff in recent times. Currently, there are four fully-qualified teachers, two teachers in training and two unqualified support staff.</p><p>There has been a significant upgrade to the outdoor environment and improvements to the indoor area.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified the need to improve systems and processes for self review, assessment and planning. In addition, the report identified the need to implement a bicultural curriculum. The centre has made good progress with improving self-review systems and processes, including some indicators of effective practice. There continues to be a need to strengthen aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to meet the needs of groups and individual children in a safe, secure and loving environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is designed to promote child-led and play-based learning. Children are able to make choices from a wide range of interesting and open-ended equipment. They sustain their play in groups or as individuals alongside supportive adults. Children enjoy gardening and exploring in a spacious natural environment. They have many opportunities to be adventurous, experiment and experience appropriate physical challenge. Children demonstrate high levels of wellbeing, and confidence as they work and play alongside their siblings and friends.</p><p>Children with additional needs benefit from an inclusive and responsive culture of learning and care. They receive appropriate support from teachers and specialist agencies. A strength is the inclusion of New Zealand sign language to support all children to communicate with those who have hearing challenges. Leaders recognise the need to develop and implement individual plans for children with additional needs.</p><p>Children up to the age of two are able to freely explore and access the indoor and outdoor environment. Care routines respond to their individual needs and reflect familiar rhythms from home. Teachers and families communicate regularly to ensure infants' care is responding to their preferences and needs. There is an attractively presented area where infants and toddlers can withdraw for calm and peaceful play and sleep when appropriate. Infants and toddlers benefit from respectful and supportive interactions with their older siblings, peers and teachers.</p><p>Many older children demonstrate high levels of social competence and problem-solving skills. They are good role models for younger children and engage in purposeful dramatic play with trusted friends. There are opportunities for children to access materials that support early literacy and mathematics concepts in meaningful contexts. Group gatherings include singing, movement and sharing stories. More flexible routines would enable children to further sustain their play. Children experience a responsive programme that meets their care needs, is inclusive of all ages and promotes their confidence as capable learners.</p><p>Children and families are able to revisit their learning through a number of initiatives such as planning books, daily diaries for children up to two years old, digital and centre-based portfolios for individual children and ongoing informal conversations about learning with families and children. There is a need to further refine and develop expectations for planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>Māori children and whānau benefit from the manaakitanga and whanaungatanga evident in practice. They are able to participate in karakia before kai, share in waiata during the day and learn about the natural world. Some te reo Māori is used in teachers' conversations with children. Older children are tuakana for their younger siblings in a family-like setting. Whānau and families are welcomed and feel comfortable to stay and play alongside children and their friends. These practices are supporting Māori children and their whānau to feel valued and affirmed in their culture.</p><p>ERO observed teaching practices that promote positive learning outcomes for children. Strategies that positively guide children's behaviour are consistently used. Teachers receive feedback about their practice and engage in professional discussion and reflection at staff meetings. They have participated in professional learning related to increasing their knowledge and understanding of Māori culture and values and best practice for infants and toddlers. These good teaching practices are promoting children's engagement in learning and their sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre owner and leaders are providing positive governance and leadership. There is a clear and shared philosophy and vision. Leaders have participated in recent mentoring and professional learning related to governance and management. Useful strategic and annual plans and goals have been developed for each area of centre operation. Self-review systems and processes support leaders to reflect on and improve centre operations. They have established professional and collegial partnerships across the service. Currently, centre policies are being reviewed and updated and the performance management system is under review. Good governance and shared leadership places the service in a strong position to provide a sustainable service for families and children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen strategic and annual planning and align with centre self review</li>
<li>align centre documentation to key guiding documents, including Ministry of Education guidelines</li>
<li>develop clear and agreed expectations for implementing <em>Te Whāriki</em> in a local context</li>
<li>review and refine expectations for assessment, planning and evaluation with attention to planning for individual children, particularly those with additional needs.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers and leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>build their understanding of culturally responsive practices that acknowledge the language, culture and identity of each child and their family</li>
<li>provide further opportunities to enrich and extend older children's knowledge and use of early literacy and mathematics concepts in the context of their play.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Leaders and teachers seek ongoing professional learning and development support from the Ministry of Education to address the key next steps identified in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Over the Rainbow Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice the centre needs to ensure policies and procedures are robustly implemented for securing heavy objects, induction and mentoring and appraisal.<em></em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Over the Rainbow Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>28 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
