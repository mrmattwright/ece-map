</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Headstart Early Learning Centre Ltd is a small, rural centre catering for children from birth to school age. There are separate areas for infants and toddlers aged up to 3 years and for children from 3 years to school age. Each area has its own well-resourced outdoor play space. Most of the staff, including the centre owner and manager, are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Staffing is now stable after significant changes in 2015. The centre has all new staff, including a new centre manager. Centre ownership remains unchanged since the 2013 ERO review. Teachers are enthusiastic and the centre owner and manager are focused on establishing a new team culture and shared understandings of teaching and learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is well reflected in the daily learning opportunities provided for children. It accurately captures what the owner, manager and teachers value and prioritise as important in early childhood education and how they operate as a centre.</p><p>A recent extensive evaluation of the centre's philosophy by the manager, owner and previous staff, provides a good model and foundation for ongoing review with the new team.</p><p>The owner, manager and teachers ensure bicultural practice, including tikanga Māori and language, is strongly evident in the programme and centre practices. Managers make good use of teachers' skills to promote and sustain this focus. They are now planning a more formal review of how effectively they are promoting Māori children's success.</p><p>Children make choices and follow their own play ideas in a learning environment that is responsive to their interests. Routines provide them with good opportunities to develop their self-help skills and independence. Teachers interact with children in affirming and respectful ways.</p><p>Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging are well supported. The small group size and low ratios for the youngest children provide regular, sustained interactions between infants, toddlers and teachers and promote positive relationships.</p><p>Children's learning about environmental sustainability and the natural world is enhanced through regular opportunities to explore and use natural materials and resources within their play.</p><p>Teachers make good use of the local community to extend children's learning experiences, including helping children become familiar with the local school to support successful transitions.</p><p>The centre owner, manager and teachers value and promote effective partnerships with parents. They seek useful information from parents about their aspirations for children's learning. Parents have regular opportunities to provide feedback on aspects of service in a range of ways.</p><p>The diverse cultures of children and their families are responded to proactively. Teachers find out what is important to each family and support this within the programme. They make effective use of community resources to learn more about the cultures of children who attend their centre and to engage with families in their own languages.</p><p>Managers and teachers are responsive to and inclusive of children who require additional learning support. They work closely with their families and actively seek additional support, when necessary.</p><p>The owner, manager and teachers have recently made more effective use of internal evaluation to improve centre practices, promote team collaboration and support the development of shared understandings among staff. Their current evaluation practices include the use of professional reading to help them think more deeply about their teaching practices and give regular consideration to te ao Māori perspectives.</p><p>Managers have high expectations for teaching and learning. They know staff strengths and support staff to focus on continuing to improve teaching and learning practice. They are putting appropriate emphasis on the building of a collaborative team approach to support new teams and leaders.</p><p>The owner and centre managers have a clear vision for centre development. In collaboration with the teachers they have developed a useful strategic plan to guide future centre planning. This is regularly shared with parents. Leaders have identified areas for review to support centre improvement and are moving methodically towards implementing these in a well-considered manner.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>With many teachers new to the centre and some staff in new leadership roles, ERO and the centre leaders agree the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen all teachers' capability to understand, contribute to and begin to lead internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>successfully embed newly-developed expectations for planning and assessment to ensure consistent practices and a shared team approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen staff appraisal processes to ensure that it is effectively contributing to high quality teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and support centre leadership roles.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Headstart Early Learning Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Headstart Early Learning Centre Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu/Southern</p><p>20 December 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
