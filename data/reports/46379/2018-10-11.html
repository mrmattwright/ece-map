</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KidsZone Preschool (2013) Ltd is a stand-alone service located in the Bell Block community, east of New Plymouth. Since the June 2015 ERO report, there has been an increase to the centre licence and in the number of buildings. The service is licensed for 75 children, including 30 children up to the age of two. There are two separate areas that cater for the different age groups. The service is open for daily sessions Monday to Friday.</p><p>Two managing directors oversee centre operation. Head teachers lead the day-to-day teaching teams across the nursery and preschool areas. The majority of the staff are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The service philosophy gives priority to good quality care and education for tamariki and whƒÅnau, based on trusting relationships, inclusive practices, respect and understanding. These uphold and promote children's and whƒÅnau sense of belonging.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that it was appropriate to revisit and review the centre‚Äôs vision and philosophy and strategic planning. There has been progress in this area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is effectively implemented in practice. Children enjoy the breadth of learning opportunities offered through the well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas as explorers, creative artists and problem solvers.</p><p>Children experience learning through play as fun. They have opportunities to lead their learning and are well supported through routines promoting independence and self-management. Children engage in positive interactions with peers and adults. They demonstrate belonging and ownership in the centre, confidently communicating their ideas. Teachers and children know each other well.</p><p>The curriculum is informed by observations, individual and group planning and parent and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children. Learning assessment stories highlight children's preferences, dispositions, strengths and progress over time.</p><p>Deliberate acts of teaching purposefully guide and support children‚Äôs progression and continuity of learning. Links to strategic goals, the philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are incorporated.</p><p>Children enjoy learning opportunities through literacy, mathematics, science, music, art and physical exploration. They are engaged, sustained learners. Parents participate in an online programme to inform and respond to their children's learning. Leaders have identified that a key next step is to implement a consistent, planned approach for individual children and to deepen teachers' analysis and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience an effective responsive curriculum. Teachers demonstrate care and compassion, gentle interactions and respectful relationships supporting child-led learning.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is visually represented through MƒÅori artefacts, kupu MƒÅori, MƒÅori art and design, and children's pepeha. Children participate in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori rituals and learning experiences that include karakia and waiata. Leaders identify a next step to effectively provide for MƒÅori learners, is to further strengthen te ao MƒÅori knowledge and understandings and include Taranaki landmarks and localised stories.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. The service has accessed professional learning and external agency input to support children's positive learning outcomes. The centre has well-considered transition processes into and within the centre and on to school.</p><p>The directors demonstrate a strong commitment to the enactment of the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre. Useful systems and processes guide practices. The centre's strategic plan, vision and philosophy provide clear direction for leaders and teachers.</p><p>Review for improvement and accountability is well established. Leaders acknowledge internal evaluation requires further development. To strengthen teachers' capability to sustain and continually improve teaching and learning for all children leaders should implement an effective framework that includes: evaluative questions; relevant indicators; evaluative analysis of data gathered; and evaluation of the impact of change.</p><p>The appraisal process is currently under review. Leaders acknowledge a key next step is to implement a robust appraisal process for staff that reflects Education Council requirements and outlines timeframes and expectations for: meetings; goal setting and progress; targeted observations of teachers' practice linked to their goals; teaching as inquiry; feedback, feedforward; annual summary; and an evidential file.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure consistency in planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build te ao MƒÅori knowledge, understanding and implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen effective internal evaluation capability for all teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a robust appraisal procedure.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KidsZone Preschool (2013) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KidsZone Preschool (2013) Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>11 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
