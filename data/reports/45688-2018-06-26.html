</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Funshine Early Learning Centre is located in Riversdale, a rural community close to Gore. The centre is licensed for 30 children aged two-to-five years. The centre is governed by a board of trustees that is connected to the Presbyterian Church.</p><p>A new teaching team has been established this year. There are two fully registered teachers, two provisionally registered teachers and two teacher aides. A head teacher has been appointed in the past year. She is new to the role of head teacher.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on shared values and beliefs. These include Christian values, bicultural perspectives and building reciprocal relationships with the community and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The trustees, leader and teachers have responded well to the recommendations from the 2014 education review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive interactions between teachers and children and a caring and supportive environment, help children to develop a sense of wellbeing and belonging. There is an intentional focus on valuing all cultures. A broad range of curriculum opportunities engage children in and extend their learning. Increasing use is being made of community resources to enhance children's learning opportunities and connections to their local community.</p><p>A commitment to a bicultural curriculum and te ao MƒÅori is highly evident. Children's culture and language is acknowledged and well supported in the programme. They benefit from the opportunity to learn te reo MƒÅori and are taught to perform their mihi.</p><p>The head teacher is developing and embedding systems and processes. These are to ensure teachers have a shared understanding of expectations and demonstrate consistency of practice. This has included clarifying roles and responsibilities for all people involved with the centre. A next step is to continue to embed, refine and consolidate new systems to be more consistent for all children.</p><p>The head teacher and trustees have developed a strategic and annual plan that outlines key priorities for the centre. There is a shared responsibility taken for achieving the vision and priorities for improvement. The head teacher keeps the board well informed about progress she is making towards achieving the strategic priorities.</p><p>Strong reciprocal partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau effectively support children's learning. Parents' involvement in their children's care and education is highly valued and sought after. Teachers work closely with parents and whƒÅnau to learn about children's interests, strengths and identity. A next step is to more consistently show in documentation, how teachers are responding to parent aspirations.</p><p>The leader, teachers and children benefit from ongoing and well-planned professional development. They make good use of networking to build leader and teacher capability. A useful system for appraisal has recently been introduced. New teachers are well supported by useful induction and mentoring processes.</p><p>Newly-developed systems for assessment, planning and evaluation clearly recognise and reflect children's language, culture and identity. Teachers identify and use intentional strategies to support children's learning. They clearly specify the desired valued outcomes for children's learning. Group planning needs to show more clearly the intended learning, and to deepen the evaluation for effectiveness.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes are contributing to improvements to processes and practices at the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the trustees, leader and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>further refine strategic planning</li>
<li>strengthen aspects of planning, assessment and evaluation for groups and individuals</li>
<li>deepen their understanding and use of robust internal evaluation</li>
<li>integrate the valued outcomes into the philosophy and key documents.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Funshine Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Leaders and trustees need to amend their child protection policy to reflect the direct reporting requirements under the Vulnerable Children's Act. This has been updated since the on-site stage of the review.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Funshine Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>26 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
