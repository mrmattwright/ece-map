</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ashhurst Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association‚Äôs playcentres during Term 4, 2014.</p><p>The centre is open for four mornings per week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid supervisor supports parents and whƒÅnau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members‚Äô practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together‚Äô, encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whƒÅnau working collectively to support children‚Äôs learning. A community of learners and strong sense of family is clearly evident. At the time of this review, all parents at this centre are undertaking Playcentre training. This well-established playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Spontaneous, child-initiated learning is supported by the high ratio of adults to children. Individuals are encouraged to freely explore areas of play and activities in their own time. Interactions between adults and children are warm, purposeful and responsive. The atmosphere is peaceful and relaxed. Children‚Äôs wellbeing is fostered in this safe and secure emotional environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported to explore, interact, play and have fun with attentive adults and each other.</p><p>Useful processes for assessment have been established. Programme planning is informed by children‚Äôs interests, parents‚Äô ideas and session evaluations. Assessment, in the form of learning stories, is a current focus of self review. Parents capture the observed interests of their own children and those of others. Continuity of each child‚Äôs learning is beginning to be captured in attractive portfolios. Participation in Playcentre-run courses should further build members‚Äô consistent practice in assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is reflected through waiata, signage, murals and consistent use of te reo MƒÅori. Further provision of programmes that relate to the centre‚Äôs local environment is a next step for development.</p><p>Literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science learning are integrated throughout the curriculum in appropriate ways. Members have developed a close liaison with local schools, supporting families and children‚Äôs transition.</p><p>Centre members work well as a team. They are highly reflective and aware of their roles and responsibilities. A high level of trust is evident among members. Leadership is collaborative and inclusive.</p><p>A process for planned self review has been developed and leads to improvement and change. Centre members have identified that they should evaluate the impact of review to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Useful support is provided by the association. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finance and legislative obligations. Work is being completed to improve employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach.</p><p>The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members‚Äô understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>liaison support so it is consistently effective in identifying and responding to centre needs</li>
<li>appraisal for employees</li>
<li>members‚Äô understanding about te ao MƒÅori .</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>weaving their knowledge of the local area and history into the programme</li>
<li>using strategies and approaches to effectively promote MƒÅori children‚Äôs success as MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ashhurst Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service provider should ensure that police vetting of employees is undertaken prior to their employment and subsequently, every three years.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ashhurst Playcentre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>16 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
