</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ebabies @ Glenholme is a privately owned education and care centre located on the grounds of Glenholme School in Rotorua. It is licensed for 32 children over two years of age. The centre's roll of 26 children includes 16 who identify as MƒÅori and whakapapa to Te Arawa.</p><p>This centre opened in 2016 and since this time has experienced significant changes to the leadership and teaching team. This is its first ERO review.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims to provide quality care and education that is accessible, affordable and which meets the needs of its community. The philosophy also promotes the principles of whakawhanaungatanga, manaakitanga, aroha, tautoko and 21st century e-learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive and caring relationships are evident between teachers, children and whƒÅnau. Teachers know children and families well. They engage in supportive and respectful relationships with children and whƒÅnau. Children, parents and whƒÅnau told ERO that they enjoy their time at the centre.</p><p>Teachers interact positively with children. They use strategies to invite and develop children's play and learning. There is a natural integration of literacy, including an emphasis on oral language and mathematics. Children observed by ERO, were enjoying cooperative and purposeful play.</p><p>The focus on the ‚Äòenvironment as the third teacher‚Äô is providing children with a range of open- ended resources from which they can choose. Good indoor-outdoor access and flow is evident. There are regular visits to the local and wider community, particularly places of significance to MƒÅori. Children are developing a positive sense of themselves as learners.</p><p>The recently appointed head teacher is providing an inclusive and collaborative leadership approach for the centre. She has been involved in developing systems in relation to self review, assessment, planning and evaluation of the programme. This is contributing to an improved child-led, play-based curriculum. In addition, she is implementing an inclusive whƒÅnau-based service, with a strong focus on increasing the MƒÅori and Pacific cultural dimensions in the centre. Children benefit from a centre that promotes MƒÅori and Pacific language, culture and identity.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Governance and management systems and practices require improvement. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>human resource and performance management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher registration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policy and procedural review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service's curriculum is influenced by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Akonga o nga ngaru</em>, and increasingly <em>Te Whatu P≈çkeka</em>. The new teaching team is developing their skills and knowledge in this area. Further development of assessment practices should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>better analysis of the learning to inform planning, resourcing and programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing effective teaching strategies that add complexity for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stronger evaluation of the quality of education and care for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The provision for professional learning and development needs to be strengthened. Stronger alignment with teacher appraisal goals, practising teacher criteria and areas for development identified in this report is needed. This is necessary to build teachers' capability to improve and extend learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Clear strategic direction and planning for the growth and development of the service is required. Processes for budgeting and the head teacher's involvement in centre development and management of expenditure is necessary to ensure ongoing sustainability.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ebabies @ Glenholme completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meeting the Education Council requirements for appraisal and teacher registration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and update of policies relating to Child Protection, Positive Guidance and Performance management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure an ongoing process of self review is implemented to enable the service to maintain and improve the quality of its education and care</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7, C1,C2, HS 31]</i></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ebabies @ Glenholme will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>16 October 2017</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
