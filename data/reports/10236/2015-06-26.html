</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Tree Early Childcare Centre in Unsworth Heights, Auckland, is licensed to provide full day and sessional education and care for 148 children, including up to 50 children aged less than two years. Children are grouped according to age in six separate rooms with shared outdoor play areas.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report the centre&rsquo;s ownership has changed. The new owners have merged the two licences previously operating under Topkids Saturn Place. Extensive improvements to the premises include the provision of a new room upstairs specifically for children aged between two and three-and-a-half years.</p><p>The centre director and centre manager have successfully established a qualified and diverse teaching team. Consideration has been given to developing effective teams in each room. The diversity of the community is reflected in these teaching teams.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy statement focuses strongly on children&rsquo;s individuality. The provision of a loving and inspirational environment that supports children&rsquo;s holistic needs is important to the new team. Values of honesty, respect, trust, integrity and co-operation underpin centre practices.</p><p>The 2012 ERO reports for the Topkids Centres highlighted the need to strengthen self review and bicultural practices. Safe fall material in two of the outdoor environments did not meet safety requirements. Progress has been made in improving self review and the learning environments.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play collaboratively in attractive, well-resourced environments that encourage their exploration. Effective teaching practices and interactions encourage children to settle and become highly focused in their play.</p><p>Children aged less than two years benefit from having consistent teaching teams who provide them with nurturing, individualised care. Older children have opportunities to set themselves challenges and lead their learning. Children approach adults with confidence and show a strong sense of belonging in their environment.</p><p>Parents who spoke to ERO shared their appreciation of the management team&rsquo;s support and responsiveness to the needs of their families. Teachers&rsquo; inclusive practice and their relationships with children were also identified as strengths. Parents enjoy children&rsquo;s portfolios, which are attractive records of children's ongoing learning. Teachers could develop portfolios to better reflect the cultural heritage of each child, and the partnerships they are establishing with wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Teachers listen well to children. Their observations and knowledge of individual children help them to provide a programme relevant to their interests and dispositions. Teachers have responded positively to professional development that is guiding their programme planning and curriculum refinements.</p><p>Teachers have a sense of ownership and pride in their practice. They collaborate well with each other. Teaching teams are committed to developing environments that are unique, aesthetically pleasing, and promote children&rsquo;s learning. Environments include pieces of teacher-made furniture suited to children&rsquo;s particular needs.</p><p>Self review processes are based on identifying and improving outcomes for children. All staff members have opportunities to be involved in and to lead self review projects. Decisions around governance, teaching practice and professional learning are informed by self review and changes made are monitored and evaluated.</p><p>Teachers have committed to a professional development programme to develop their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori perspectives and to strengthen the centre&rsquo;s bicultural practice. Teachers acknowledge the importance of recognising each child&rsquo;s language and culture to support children to develop a sense of identity in the centre.</p><p>The new owners have made good progress in establishing a teaching team with a shared vision of high quality early childhood education and care. The centre philosophy, which is currently being reviewed, is clearly evident in practice. Centre operations are guided by a framework of effective policies and procedures.</p><p>Centre leaders are committed to developing sustainable leadership capacity across the centre. They have successfully promoted an organisational culture that is focused on improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and managers have identified appropriate next steps for centre development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening bicultural practice and understandings of te ao M&#257;ori perspectives</li>
<li>considering further ways of including families&rsquo; involvement in the programme</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Tree Early Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Tree Early Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>26 June 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2&nbsp;Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
