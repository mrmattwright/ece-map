</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puddleducks‚Äô Montessori Preschool is privately owned and operates under the umbrella of Aspiring¬†Services Ltd. The centre provides a Montessori programme of education and care within the framework of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> The service caters for children from two and a half to six years of age and their whƒÅnau, from across the Manawatu region.</p><p>The philosophy is underpinned by a discovery model, where children learn concepts from working with materials rather than by direct instruction. Specialised Montessori educational equipment, supplemented by other resources, is used by children.</p><p>Teachers are qualified and registered. The lead teacher is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. Management is supportive and provides teachers with opportunities to participate in appropriate professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>Since the October 2011 ERO report a professional leader has been appointed to provide support and guidance to the team. Many of the team have been in their roles for some time.</p><p>Puddleducks‚Äô Montessori Preschool has a good reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy frequent opportunities to explore their own interests within a well-considered curriculum. They are highly engaged in learning, both independently and alongside others.</p><p>Adults acknowledge the child as being competent and capable of complex learning. Responsive and attentive teachers support children‚Äôs physical and emotional development in beautiful surroundings. The atmosphere in classrooms is calm and harmonious.</p><p>Teachers use deliberate strategies to encourage and extend children‚Äôs language and thinking. They foster self-discovery and independence. Children are well supported to become confident in early reading, writing, mathematics and science learning through purposeful interactions with teachers and thoughtfully presented resources.</p><p>Successful transitions to school are assisted by effective partnerships between families, centre and school. The centre belongs to a network of local early childhood and primary school practitioners to further support children‚Äôs favourable transition to school.</p><p>Teachers comprehensively assess the progress of children through the Montessori curriculum. They keep ongoing observational records of children‚Äôs mastery and learning behaviours, introducing new concepts and skills when children are ready. Teachers capture significant moments through stories. They analyse learning and identify future pathways for individuals.</p><p>Assessment material is contained in attractive profiles. These books are shared with children and families who have opportunities to contribute. Portfolios provide for continuity of learning and a greater understanding of the child as a learner.</p><p>Biculturalism is highly valued. The lead teacher actively supports her team to develop culturally responsive practice. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are successfully interwoven throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers consult with whƒÅnau about aspirations for their child and what success might look like for MƒÅori children attending the centre. Leaders and teachers acknowledge they still have work to do in this area.</p><p>Leaders are strongly committed to the service‚Äôs philosophy, vision and goals. They provide staff with clear, written feedback and feed forward to guide curriculum, assessment, teaching practice and self review.</p><p>Recent changes have led to a professional growth and development model to build teacher capability. This new initiative is also linked to the centre strategic plan. A specific approach to appraising the head teacher is planned to extend her leadership capability.</p><p>Teachers are guided by managers and leaders to research and share their inquiries about teaching and learning with each other. This practice is aligned to their interests and strengths. It is agreed that further development to this should include support for teachers to set goals that are more closely linked to improvements that strengthen outcomes for teaching and learning.</p><p>Managers are aware of the importance of supporting leaders new to their role to promote improvements to teaching and learning. A new operations manager provides enhanced support for leaders and has an appropriate focus on building capability in leading teaching and learning.</p><p>Continuing to build leadership practice should help promote sustainable outcomes and embed desired practices. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>Reviews reflect on aspects of the programme contributing to ongoing improvements and change.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and ERO agree that the next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the evaluative inquiry aspect of self review</li>
<li>teaching as inquiry and the professional growth and development model to support teachers‚Äô improved practice</li>
<li>the appraisal of the lead teacher using a leadership as inquiry model</li>
<li>a culturally responsive curriculum through using <em>Ka Hikitia:</em> <em>Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em></li>
<li>the use of<em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> to explore how the competencies might further inform appraisal and attestation against the New Zealand Teachers Council Registered Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puddleducks' Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puddleducks' Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>7 October 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
