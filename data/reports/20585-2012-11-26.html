<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2>
</div><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>This service is developing capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.¬† Since the 2006 ERO report, Kids Biz Preschool and Daycare have worked to improve the quality of teaching and learning practices.¬† <b></b></p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kids Biz Preschool and Daycare is a privately owned, full day, education and care service.¬† It caters for small numbers of children from birth to school age.¬† The centre‚Äôs philosophy places high value on establishing warm relationships between children, parents, whƒÅnau and teachers.¬† Relationships are very inclusive, respectful and caring.¬† Children spend large amounts of time playing in mixed age groups.¬† This approach is an important feature of the programme that supports the emotional wellbeing of siblings particularly well.¬† The learning programme is unhurried and is aimed at supporting each child‚Äôs individual participation in the programme.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO report there has been a complete turnover of staff.¬† This report finds that curriculum planning is still teacher led and based on activities.¬† The challenge for managers and teachers is to make the programme more responsive to children‚Äôs individual and group interests.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The managers have developed a sound policy framework and useful management systems to provide the foundation for the centre‚Äôs operation.¬† Managers are focused on continually improving practice.¬† Staff are still developing their capacity to make ongoing positive changes through self review.¬† To further improve the management of the centre, managers could:</p><ul>
<li>review the centre philosophy so that it is clear and provides staff with a shared understanding of expected teaching practices</li>
<li>develop specific job descriptions for staff</li>
<li>further align performance management processes to indicators of high quality practice.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers link the programme closely to the strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.¬† They are encouraging parents to have more input into their children‚Äôs learning. ¬†Children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and belonging in the centre is very evident.¬† Good provision is made for individual children with special learning needs.</p><p>Positive shifts are being made in supporting MƒÅori learners. An important next step would be to consider how to better support Maori cultural identity in the programme and to build an awareness of biculturalism for all children.</p><p>To further improve practice, teachers could promote opportunities for children to develop independence as learners. Making the learning environment more accessible would be a useful step in encouraging independent learning and self management. Regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the learning environment would also be a useful practice.</p><p>Teachers could also be supported to improve their planning and assessment practices.¬† This should include developing:</p><ul>
<li>more consistent assessment practices that focus on how teachers will use children‚Äôs‚Äô strengths and interests to promote learning</li>
<li>a clearer understanding of the role of the teacher in stimulating learning</li>
<li>a shared understanding of early childhood education theories, especially for younger children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should give priority to planning programmes based on identifying and extending children‚Äôs ongoing and emerging learning interests.</p><p>Some health and safety matters were discussed during the review.¬† Strengthening ongoing self review of the centre environment would be a useful step in maintaining a safe environment.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kids Biz Preschool and Daycare completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To address these, the centre managers must:</p><ul>
<li>secure furniture and equipment that could fall and cause injury or damage,<br> <em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 1998, 23(2)];</em>¬†</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>provide adequate fall spaces around climbing equipment, <br> <em>[Education (ECC) Regulations 1998, 23(2), 24(1a, 4)].<br> </em></li>
</ul><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.¬†</p><p>Makere Smith<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>26 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
