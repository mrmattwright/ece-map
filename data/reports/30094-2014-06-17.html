</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taupo Childrens Corner (Lakeview Drive) provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age, within two age-specific areas. The centre is one of two centres owned and governed by the Mark Passmore Family Trust (MPFT). The facilities are purpose built and include an extra grass area adjacent to the centre for extending outside play. The centre is licensed for 40, including a maximum of 9 children under the age of two years. The current roll is 47, including 11 children identified as Māori.</p><p>The MPFT retains responsibility for financial, property and employment matters, strategic planning and for meeting legislative requirements. The licensee and centre manager are responsible for policy and procedure development, quality assurance, and overall governance on behalf of the trust. This includes daily operations and professional leadership. While there have been significant changes of staff since the 2014 ERO review, the centre has retained a high proportion of qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy is to support children to achieve success, and to respond to their interests and strengths. There is a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and to te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>The MPFT and centre leaders have responded positively to the recommendations in the previous ERO report, relating to strategic planning, teacher appraisal, and effective programme planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engaged in high quality learning through play. Teachers demonstrate positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. They effectively promote children’s language development through authentic conversations and the use of open-ended questions. Children are respected, and benefit from being encouraged to make choices throughout the day. Risk taking and problem solving is fostered through appropriate challenges. Teachers' use deliberate strategies to extend children's learning. Well-established routines support children to develop as self-managing, socially competent learners. Teachers should consider ways to improve children's ongoing access to resources, especially in the outside play areas.</p><p>Children up to two years of age benefit from a safe, stimulating and well-presented environment, which provides easy access to the outdoor play areas. There are positive, nurturing relationships between teachers and children. Teachers are responsive to the emotional and physical needs of young children in their care, and ensure familiarity and consistency between home and centre routines for children. There are opportunities for children of all ages to interact during the day.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to plan a learning programme in response to children’s emerging interests and strengths. Children are well supported by stimulating, engaging and well-resourced environments. Literacy and numeracy are deliberately and authentically integrated across the curriculum. The local community and environment are well used as contexts to support learning. The organisation of the learning programme is enabling children to become confident and capable learners.</p><p>Learning partnerships with parents are well developed. Extensive information about each child and their family is gathered at the time of enrolment. This information is well used to plan experiences that focus on positive outcomes for children. Effective self-review has resulted in positive and supportive transitions into, through and out of the centre for all children and their parents. Parents and whānau value the individual assessment portfolios that include multiple teacher perspectives, and reflect each child's participation in the programme. A useful next step is for teachers is to more deliberately include parent and child voice in the assessment process. This is likely to further enhance the partnership in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre culture is highly inclusive. Bicultural elements are evident through the use of te reo Māori and the inclusion of aspects of tikanga such as karakia, waiata, visual symbols and displays. Diverse cultures are valued, and children with additional learning and health needs are well supported.</p><p>Effective leadership promotes quality practice and strong relational trust amongst teachers, children and parents. Leaders plan for professional learning and development focused on improving centre practices. There is a well-considered approach to induction for new staff. The next step for centre leaders is to fully embed the current appraisal processes. This should include teaching as inquiry as a vehicle for achieving set goals, and formal observations of practice along with documented feedback and feed forward.</p><p>The centre benefits from a clear sense of purpose and direction. The strategic plan identifies appropriate priorities and goals that focus on enhancing outcomes for children and their families. The annual plan is supported by a policy framework that ensures operational management is efficient and well monitored. All teachers are involved in self-review, which is focused on improving outcomes for all children. It is now important for MPFT to implement an external performance management system for the centre manager.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>access external expertise to strengthen the appraisal of the centre manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teacher appraisal processes to include key components of good practice. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taupo Childrens Corner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taupo Childrens Corner will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>10 August 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
