</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Tot Spot is a privately owned service located in the suburb of Greerton in Tauranga. It provides all day care and education for children from birth to five years. The centre is made up of three rooms, babies, toddlers, and preschool. The centre is licensed for 84 children including 23 children up to the age of two. At the time of this ERO review there are 95 children enrolled, including seven Māori children.</p><p>The centre owner/manager takes responsibility for governance matters. The head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day organisation, curriculum, and teaching practices. She also oversees the coordination of the under two area. There is a room co-ordinator who takes responsibility for the over two areas. A recent result of self review has been the appointment of 'key teachers' for a set number of children and families.</p><p>The centre has had a positive previous ERO report. They have made significant progress in addressing the areas for development related to the centre philosophy and vision statements, assessment, planning and evaluation, self review and transition to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a curriculum that is centred on dispositional learning and underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Key teachers know children well, follow their interests and promote continuity of learning and care. A feature of this centre is the flexible routines, which allows children to make choices for learning and sustain play. This positive outcome results from effective self review. Children have benefitted by the centre gardens where they can learn and experience the growth cycle of plants. This supports understanding of Papatūānuku and sustainability, as well as Manakitanga through sharing and eating kai together.</p><p>There are many opportunities for children to build their early understanding of literacy and mathematical concepts through stories, role play and access to appropriate materials and equipment. Teachers provide a wide range of experiences that respond to children's interests and especially boys. A particular strength of this centre is the inclusive approach for families and children with identified physical and learning challenges.</p><p>Children under two benefit from key teachers who are deliberate in their practice of following home routines, providing nurturing and responsive care, and familiarity. Children demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging in a calm and well-settled environment. They are immersed in a language-rich setting that supports their communication skills. Infants and toddlers are active explorers and have ready access to the large outdoor area that is interesting and challenging. They also have the opportunity to experience gardens that support their knowledge of the natural world. Teachers should continue to review current theory and practice related to respectful and aesthetically planned routines, appropriate equipment for this age group, and maintaining a hygienic environment.</p><p>Children experience a well-planned transition into the two to three and a half years room. This includes teachers recognising children's preference for a particular teacher that will support their continuing journey of learning. They are encouraged to build on their self-help and self-management skills through their interests and strengths. Individual learning is enhanced by teacher's intentional and deliberate planning to extend children's knowledge and skills.</p><p>Children who are nearing school age enjoy the expertise of key teachers who are promoting their learning through the use of reflective teaching journals. They are encouraged to express their ideas and opinions, explore dramatic and creative play, and extend their knowledge of the wider world. There are clear plans to build on children's dispositions and emerging interests.</p><p>Children experience opportunities for leadership and responsibility through the Rangatiratanga initiative. This is promoting a positive environment for Māori children and whānau through building their independence and social skills. Children experience opportunities to develop a love of books and literacy in a print-rich environment. Teachers now need to consider how they can further integrate authentic ways to build literacy and numeracy into the curriculum and children’s learning.</p><p>The centre promotes and engages in positive and supportive relationships with parents and whānau. They operate with an open-door policy that provides a welcoming environment where parents can participate at their own pace. Parents spoken to by ERO express appreciation for the service provided for them and children.</p><p>Teachers are developing a positive collegial team with a shared understanding and philosophy. They are enthusiastic about professional learning and development, and share professional knowledge at their regular teacher meeting. They have developed supportive and collaborative relationships with specialist agencies that promote positive outcomes for children with special needs. Good quality practice observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers implementing intentional and deliberate teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning conversations that promote children's thinking and problem solving skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent learning and development skills that positively guide children's behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers actively engaging in children's play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers using rich dialogue that promotes language acquisition.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children are confident and competent learners.</p><p>Self review is having a positive impact on centre development and improvement. There are clear and high expectations relating to the teachers' practicing criteria, and effective induction and mentoring process for provisionally registered teachers. Review of planning, assessment and evaluation has improved teaching practice and promoted positive outcomes for children. Centre leaders model good practice and have appropriate experience in their roles to develop teacher capability. </p><p>The centre owner is committed to providing a quality service for families and children, and building the capability of team members. She places strong emphasis on providing high quality professional spaces and learning opportunities for teachers. The centre environment is well provisioned and designed to support positive learning outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explore further ways that enable parents to share their goals and aspirations for children's learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to implement the strategic approach to bi-cultural and multicultural responsive practices in the centre environment and programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop strategic plans that guide centre development and promote sustainability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>That the centre leaders continue to review and further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>aspects of governance and management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>culturally responsive practices</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Tot Spot completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practise the centre owner needs to ensure that the annual appraisal process is fully implemented for all staff. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Tot Spot will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>1 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
