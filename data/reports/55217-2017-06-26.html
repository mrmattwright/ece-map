</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Awapuni Under Fives Community Preschool is a community-based early learning service in Gisborne that provides education and care for up to 30 children aged over two. It is situated within the grounds of Awapuni Primary School.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board made up of parents whose children are, or have been, enrolled. Day-to-day management of operation, teaching and learning is the responsibility of a leadership team comprising the head teacher and assistant head teacher. At the time of this report there were five qualified staff.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships, respect and care for children's growth and development.</p><p>Centre staff have responded well to the next steps identified in the March 2014 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy and values are evident in practice. There is a supportive and welcoming culture. Children engage in a programme that assists them to be confident and competent learners. Cooperative play and friendships are encouraged and positive relationships between teachers and children are evident.</p><p>The centre is well resourced to promote children's creativity and support their interests. Their sense of belonging is enhanced through displays celebrating them and their work. Literacy, numeracy, science and creativity are successfully integrated into the programme. Children have ongoing, supported opportunities for investigation, exploration and challenge.</p><p>Teachers are kind and respectful, engaging well with children to support them in their play. They should continue to identify and implement strategies that extend children's ideas and maximise opportunities for them to lead their learning and persevere in their play over time. </p><p>The curriculum is strongly based on children's interests and strengths. Teachers also plan activities to engage children and introduce new ideas. An online assessment tool is used effectively to communicate with families about the programme and centre events.</p><p>Children's journals are an attractive record of their participation and engagement in centre life. These provide a way for families to contribute to their children's learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers should continue to strengthen their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation. Further consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>documenting, and planning to meet, parent/whānau aspirations for their children's learning</li>
<li>ensuring an appropriate balance of child-initiated and teacher-directed learning episodes is recorded</li>
<li>increasing the focus on showing how teachers are identifying next steps to extend children's strengths and interests, and progress their learning</li>
<li>reviewing the curriculum policy to clarify revised expectations for assessment practice.</li>
</ul><p>Diversity is recognised and celebrated. Children's languages, cultures and identities are valued and acknowledged. Teachers have well-developed knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori.</p><p>Extensive links with the local and wider community have been developed which contribute to a range of learning opportunities for children. A close relationship with the adjoining primary school has been achieved. Teachers should continue to seek ways of sharing information about individual children's learning and early childhood practice with new entrant teachers to further strengthen their approach to support children's transition to school.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led by the head teacher. She has good support from board members who work collaboratively with the teaching team to improve outcomes for children, their families and whānau.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have participated in relevant professional learning and development (PLD) to support their roles. A new appraisal process has recently been developed that has the potential to build teacher practice to improve outcomes for children. This now needs to be implemented along with the programme of support for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>Use of internal evaluation is at an early stage of development. Recent training has supported teachers' shared understanding. A next step is to support the team's ongoing use of the agreed evaluative framework to measure the quality and effectiveness of priority areas of practice and operation. </p><p>The governance board provides good support for centre operation. Trustees show a commitment to improving management systems. Parents and whānau are regularly consulted. Work has commenced on documenting expectations in relation to governance roles and responsibilities. Although some strategic priorities have been identified, further work should be undertaken to define desired outcomes, especially in relation to teaching and learning. These can then be used to support annual planning, the monitoring of progress towards goals, and decision making about PLD and planned internal evaluation. Increased collaboration with staff about long-term planning should support their ownership of the future the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders, teachers and ERO agree there is a need to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the induction and mentoring programme for provisionally registered teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding of governance and management roles and responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Awapuni Under Fives Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, systems should be put in place to ensure that resources, furniture and fittings are adequately secured and do not pose a high risk in the event of an earthquake. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Awapuni Under Fives Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>26 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
