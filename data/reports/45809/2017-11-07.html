</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Building Blocks is a privately owned Homebased Care Service in the Manawatu, based in Palmerston North. Since the February 2014 ERO report, the service has grown to two networks. This ERO report is on Building Blocks Network One.</p><p>Day-to-day organisation and oversight are shared by the manager and two coordinators. The coordinators oversee the teaching and learning programmes and environments provided for children in educators' homes.</p><p>The service is licensed for 80 children up to five years of age, for five days a week. At the time of this review the roll is 63. Of these, 25 children identify as Māori and two as of Pacific heritage. The <br> in-home educators include Māori and Pacific people.</p><p>The philosophy of Building Blocks emphasises the importance of valuing and supporting families. Building partnerships and reciprocal, responsive relationships with parents and whānau are fostered as a firm foundation for children's learning.</p><p>There has been some progress across the areas for development and review identified in the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in positive relationships with each other and adults. Information from parents affirms educators' focus on children experiencing positive education and care. Infants and toddlers are well supported to engage with other children. Parents discuss and agree to their child's routines. A focus on child-led learning is encouraged. Children's interests are fostered.</p><p>Children benefit from a range of learning experiences in educators’ homes and in the local community. Many attend Building Blocks playgroups and planned outings that provide new challenges and opportunities to socialise. The service and coordinators provide a wide variety of materials to support educators to develop learning experiences for the children. </p><p>Home visits by the manager and coordinators are used well to check that health and safety requirements are met and there are suitable experiences for children.</p><p><em>Te Whāriki, </em>the early childhood curriculum, guides educators in their understanding about assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. The coordinators model appropriate practice.</p><p>Children's learning is recorded and shared with families and whānau. Coordinators provide positive guidance, new ideas and prompts for educators to develop and extend learning. The educator manual provides expectations for teaching and learning.</p><p>Parents’ aspirations, input and feedback are valued. A focus has been to strengthen relationships between educators, families and whānau. An online platform has been introduced to further extend opportunities for educators, families and whānau to communicate about children's education and care.</p><p>Professional development is supporting the service to develop systems and processes. These are designed to more readily focus on coordinators and educators promoting children as competent capable learners.</p><p>Coordinators support best practice for educators who facilitate infants' learning and development. There is a focus on age appropriate environments and resources. Journals and daily books are used to record routines and learning. Child placement practices are well considered.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics, arts, science and physical play are richly woven through learning programmes. Coordinators feedback to educators and record children’s emerging interests and suggestions for development. Communication with parents about children's wellbeing and progress is shared regularly face-to-face, in photographs and through emails.</p><p>A well-considered curriculum design for planning of learning has been developed, but yet to be fully implemented. Assessment practice needs strengthening. Coordinators support educators to develop planning. A next step is to improve coordinators' visit notes so that they include ideas about educators’ next stages of development as learning facilitators. Continued focus on helping educators understand and describe children’s learning should be useful.</p><p>Te ao Māori knowledge and understanding are valued. A management strategy has been to source Māori expertise to develop and build educators' Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based practice. Māori coordinators also guide processes. Understanding of Pacific knowledge and cultures is shared by Pacific educators.</p><p>Children's transition to school is well-considered. Coordinators visit educators to assist with questionnaires and 'Journey to School' books to support children and families.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are welcomed. Coordinators are aware of community support and resources to assist participation of these children in learning programmes.</p><p>Management and coordinators demonstrate commitment to their roles. Open communication and positive relations are evident. Professional learning and development opportunities are sought to lift capability. </p><p>A new appraisal process is being implemented in 2017 and has the potential to enhance coordinators' professional growth and positive outcomes for children. Management agrees that a next step is to articulate clearly through the framework and policy requirements for:</p><ul>
<li>frequency of meetings and how they will be documented</li>
<li>goals that are measurable</li>
<li>formal observations by appraisers</li>
<li>constructive feedback</li>
<li>mentoring and coaching.</li>
</ul><p>The service has developed but not yet implemented a new internal evaluation framework. This is supporting development of systems and processes focused more clearly on promoting children as competent capable learners. A next step is to build greater knowledge and understanding of the purpose and use of internal evaluation in improving learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Management and coordinator continuity supports sustainability. Strategic and annual planning, and regular review are in place at governance level to support continuous improvement. However, updated guidelines for curriculum and operation have yet to be fully implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>develop and implement an educator appraisal process and fully implement the new appraisal procedure for coordinators that includes teacher inquiry, observations and coaching</li>
<li>build leaders' knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation</li>
<li>extend the quality of the teaching and learning</li>
<li>implement the curriculum design with a focus on children as learners</li>
<li>continue to build knowledge of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Building Blocks completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Building Blocks will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>7 November 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
