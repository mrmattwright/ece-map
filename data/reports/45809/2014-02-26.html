<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Building Blocks is a privately owned homebased care service (the service) operating in the Manawatu region and based in Palmerston North. It comprises one network with a manager and two visiting teachers. Twenty-eight educators provide care for 62 children aged up to five years. Responsibility for day to day management is shared between the manager and coordinators. This is the service's first ERO report.</p><p>Positive and caring relationships between educators and children are evident. Two visiting teachers support educators in their roles, as part of their home visits, through the use of positive advice and encouragement.</p><p>The programme of learning is based around children&rsquo;s and educators&rsquo; interests and ideas. Educators provide topical activities, outings and a good range of play equipment to support learning.</p><p>The manager and coordinators are committed to implementing a bicultural perspective within the organisation. This is further supported by fortnightly sessions in te reo M&#257;ori at its playgroup.</p><p>The service&rsquo;s improvement focus is evident through self review of what they do. This leads to positive outcomes for children. The service provider makes herself available to parents and educators. A range of documentation outlines expectations of the organisation and licensing requirements.</p><p>ERO and management agree that the key next steps for improvement include: supporting educators to deepen their understandings of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum; strengthening quality assurance processes; improving the staff appraisal system; and enhancing understanding of self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The service&rsquo;s philosophy acknowledges the importance of building positive relationships with people working together, in an inclusive family-based atmosphere, to care for children. A centrally based playroom is available for home educators and families to meet, network and seek support from a teacher or the manager.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Positive and caring relationships between educators and children are evident. The service personnel provide high levels of support for children&rsquo;s and educators&rsquo; emotional wellbeing. Coordinators&rsquo; visits to home educators are flexible to best meet the needs of the children.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s feelings of belonging are fostered by familiarity with the home environment. They are taken on excursions to local places of interest and to the service's playroom. Resources for children&rsquo;s use in the home environments are provided primarily by the educators, with some additional ideas and resources provided through the service.</p><p>The programme of learning is based around children&rsquo;s and educators&rsquo; interests and ideas. Educators provide topical activities and a good range of play equipment to support learning. Coordinators offer support and advice related to early childhood education, as part of their home visits. A coordinator plans a thematic programme for the playroom and community outings. Stories and photographs record children's participation at sessions and aspects of their learning linked to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Journals document children&rsquo;s day to day activities and participation in outings.</p><p>The manager and coordinators are committed to implementing a bicultural perspective within the organisation. This is further supported by fortnightly sessions in te reo M&#257;ori at the playroom sessions.</p><p>The service provider with the visiting teachers makes herself available to parents and educators. A range of documentation outlines expectations of the organisation and licensing requirements. Coordinators use home visits to check these requirements are met and provide assistance as necessary. A good range of policies supports the practice of coordinators and home educators.</p><p>The collaborative leadership team is improvement focused and reflective. A strategic plan supports development over time and is centred on quality outcomes for children.</p><p>The service&rsquo;s improvement focus is evident through its self review of what they do. This leads to positive outcomes for children. Purposeful discussion ensures issues are addressed and priorities for advancement are identified.</p><p>The service provides some support for educators to plan for children about to transition to school. It has developed a booklet for educators&rsquo; use.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>There is a need to continue to support educators&rsquo; understanding of biculturalism and what this means for their practice. While wh&#257;nau are asked about aspirations for their tamariki, service personnel need to be more proactive in recording and responding to these wishes to promote success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Actions are required to implement the strategic plan including timelines, monitoring progress and linking to self review to measure the impact of initiatives and identify development steps.</p><p>ERO and management agree that key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>supporting educators to deepen their understandings of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>strengthening quality assurance processes so that the manager can be assured that visiting teachers are meeting expectations. This should include systematic checks of coordinators' practice in homes and documentation.</li>
<li>the implementation of an improved appraisal process for teachers, including regular and constructive feedback to improve the quality of professional development</li>
<li>improving ongoing hazard checks by coordinators and organisation of trips with specific guidelines to support the care of children aged up to two.</li>
<li>undertaking a review of the philosophy to support decision making about change and improvement</li>
<li>promote further understanding of self review with a focus on how well practices support the service&rsquo;s improvement focus.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Building Blocks completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
