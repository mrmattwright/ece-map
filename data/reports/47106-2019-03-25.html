</table><p>The Children's House Greymouth is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children's House Greymouth is a privately owned centre. It opened in 2016, and was fully licensed to cater for 35 children, including 10 under two, in 2018. The centre provides sessional and all-day care in a converted villa.</p><p>The owner takes responsibility for governance and the new head teacher, appointed at the end of 2017, leads the day-to-day management of the centre. There have been a number of changes in teaching staff since the centre opened. Most teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers. Some of the teachers have Montessori qualifications.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy is underpinned by the whakatauki, 'Ko te ahurei o te tamariki aroha o taa mahi ‚Äì Let the uniqueness of the children guide our work.' The philosophy values positive relationships and the role of the teacher in supporting children to become confident, capable learners. It weaves Te WhƒÅriki, the Early Childhood Curriculum, and Montessori philosophy together.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for the Children's House Greymouth. This review is one of a cluster of two early childhood education and care centre reviews in the Children's House Hokitika Company Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are provided with many opportunities to lead their own learning in settled, unhurried learning environments. Teachers effectively support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing and are responsive to children‚Äôs needs, interests and strengths. They work together to identify and plan how best to meet specific learning priorities for each child. Te WhƒÅriki effectively underpins assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning with some aspects of the Montessori curriculum influencing learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers are committed to growing their culturally responsive practices. The increasing use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is having a positive impact on outcomes for children. Teachers are responsive and respectful of children‚Äôs home culture, celebrating the diverse cultures within the centre. Care and sensitivity is shown to towards children with additional needs and their families in the provision of learning programmes.</p><p>Effective transitions within the centre support children‚Äôs wellbeing. The well-considered learning environment allows friendships to develop and supports tuakana-teina relationships. The over two outside environment encourages exploration and creative play. Teachers model and scaffold positive interactions. Children remain focused and engaged in their learning for considerable lengths of time.</p><p>Children under two are encouraged and supported to develop independence. They are actively involved in making decisions about their learning and wellbeing. Teachers care and nurture infants and toddlers, enabling them to form strong and secure attachments. Structures and systems ensure teachers have the time to develop positive relationships with infants and toddlers and their parents and whanau.</p><p>Leaders have high expectations and are focused on what is most important for promoting positive outcomes for children. Teachers are well supported to grow their practice through collaboration, reflection and effective internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation practices, including evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching strategies and developing systems that allow for a greater contribution of children's voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a more cohesive approach to align the centre‚Äôs strategic direction and priorities for learning across key documentation and practices, including a more systematic and planned approach to professional development provision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen risk management practices and documentation when planning trips and excursions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure appraisal practices are well understood, fully comply with Teaching Council expectations and are consistently implemented so teacher practice is affirmed and challenged.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Children's House Greymouth completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>25 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
