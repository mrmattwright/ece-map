</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Child Pre-school Education Ltd is a privately owned and managed centre. It provides education and care for up to 128 children, including 30 under two years. The centre caters for different age groups in five separate rooms. Each room has its own supervisor, teachers, bathroom, sleep room, programmes and indoor and outdoor areas. Several of the children and families are new speakers of the English language.</p><p>The centre employs 23 teaching staff, most of whom are registered teachers. Two of the supervisors and some of the teaching staff are new to their roles. A long serving centre manager works closely with the centre's owner to manage the centre and lead curriculum.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy statement focuses on intentional teaching plans, incorporating the principles and strands and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The provision of a happy and stimulating environment that supports children‚Äôs holistic needs is a feature of the philosophy.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report highlighted positive relationships and an improvement to internal evaluation. Several areas were identified as areas for further improvement. These included the need to formalise strategic planning, monitor progress towards centre goals, improve appraisal systems, and build teachers' capability and cultural competence. Whilst staff changes have impacted on sustained improvement in some areas, managers have begun to implement more effective progress this year. Centre managers have recently taken care to update policies and procedures to meet legislative requirements.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play collaboratively and co-operatively. They are curious, and confident and choose activities independently. Children are benefiting from more consistent staffing throughout the centre. Children are enthusiastic about contributing to routines and practising self-help skills. Respectful teaching practice and sensitively timed interactions support children to settle, engage in conversation and to share their ideas. Children are developing the confidence to be leaders of their own learning and to test their theories about how they learn.</p><p>Children under two years receive nurturing, individualised care. Children are provided with high quality resources and equipment. The supervisor has a good knowledge of infants' individual goals and rhythms encourages teachers to be flexible in following children's individual needs and responding to their different stages of development. The teaching team would benefit from professional development that is specific to the infant and toddler age group. This should support them in providing a more spontaneous, responsive curriculum.</p><p>Centre managers have implemented a strategic goal to further enhance the learning environments to encourage children's exploration and engagement. Teaching teams are evaluating how they can enrich their indoor and outdoor environments to be more responsive to children's specific ages and stages of development, learning goals and needs.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need for teachers to access professional development to improve their bicultural practice and responsiveness to all children's cultural identity and diversity. Some teachers integrate te reo MƒÅori in routines and play through basic commands, greetings, songs and stories. Future development should support teachers to provide authentic te reo and te ao MƒÅori experiences throughout the programme for all children. Managers are still considering how the Ministry of Education's <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>, could be a helpful tool for leaders and teachers to enhance positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Teachers should inquire into effective teaching practices and research to support children and families who are new speakers of the English language. Teachers should consider how well the curriculum, environment and learning portfolios value and celebrate children's cultural heritage, home languages and family contributions. Improved parent voice and collaborative consultation about children's learning would help to inform internal evaluation processes.</p><p>Managers have recently developed systems and processes to support more consistent centre-wide curriculum practices. Teachers have begun to implement a new planning process to more specifically document their responses to children's individual and group interests. Ongoing external professional support will be key to strengthening curriculum leadership and teachers' shared understanding of good quality teaching practices. Improvements should be guided by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kei Tua o te Pae: Assessment for Learning Early Childhood Exemplars</em>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nga Arohaehae Whai Hua</em>, the self-review indicators.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This year managers have begun to implement internal evaluation to improve outcomes for children. Managers are consulting with staff more regularly to enact the strategic plan and are beginning to develop a shared understanding of the centre's future direction. They have reviewed the centre mission, philosophy and set goals to improve the teaching culture and sustainability of the centre. Teachers should now reflect on the centre philosophy and what this means for their practice. The strategic plan could now be strengthened by including more specific goals in relation to outcomes for children.</p><p>Managers are working with external professional support to refine the appraisal process. The centre employs an external professional to assist provisionally certificated teachers to attain full certification. Managers agree that they should continue to strengthen teachers' reflective practice and provide professional development that supports teachers to meet their individual goals, professional expectations and the centre's strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers are setting priorities for strengthening the sustainability of the centre. They agree that these should include ongoing external professional development to increase understanding and implementation of robust internal evaluation that promotes enhanced outcomes for children. In particular, they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to extend bicultural practices and use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> to promote familiarity with the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen teacher capability to implement an effective, emergent curriculum and responsive programme planning, assessment, evaluation and reflective practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase partnership and consultation with parents/whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expand strategic and annual planning to provide a clearer future direction and to enable regular monitoring of progress towards strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen appraisal processes for teachers and the centre manager.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Child Pre-School Education Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, centre managers should implement a cycle for reviewing policies and procedures, and establish processes to ensure that all legal requirements are met.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Child Pre-School Education Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
