</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matariki Kindergarten is situated in Wallaceville, Upper Hutt. It is a mixed-age setting operating under an all-day licence for 30 children aged two years and over, and 15 children under two years of age.</p><p>The kindergarten is currently licensed under the 1998 early childhood regulations. The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association) is working towards transitioning the kindergarten to the 2008 early childhood regulations by the end of 2014.</p><p>The teaching team has been together for two years and good progress has been made since the 2011 ERO review. The kindergarten’s philosophy and vision have recently been reviewed as a result of teachers undertaking professional development in assessment and planning.</p><p>The association coordinates the Upper Hutt Professional Learning Community (UPLC) cluster. This focuses on teachers from both the early childhood and primary sectors regularly meeting to support positive transitions to school for children. Matariki Kindergarten is part of this cluster.</p><p>The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association governs the kindergarten effectively and provides senior teacher support. The association is committed to maintaining 100% of teachers being qualified. Well developed policy guidelines clearly outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have positive and respectful interactions with children. Relationships with parents and whānau are valued. They know the children and their families well.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and this contributes to them having a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals. These are highly evident in practice. Many opportunities are provided for children to be involved in tuakana teina relationships. Aspects of te ao Māori are integrated into the environment. Teachers are committed to implementing this further.</p><p>The programme is focused on children’s emerging interests and they lead their own learning. Children engage in sustained play both independently and in groups. Teachers use a range of teaching methods to support children’s learning. Regular visits into the community are used to extend the curriculum. Te reo Māori and appropriate tikanga Māori practices are incorporated into the programme.</p><p>The environment is used effectively and provides many opportunities for children to engage in a wide range of learning experiences that promote exploration, challenge, physical play and development. The space for infants and toddlers provides opportunities for them to develop at their own pace. Transitions into the kindergarten and between the under-two and over-two spaces are flexible and managed effectively.</p><p>There are redeveloped assessment and planning processes in place, led by knowledgeable people. Practice has the potential to promote opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>linking learning over time within the portfolios</li>
<li>teachers to focus further on their role and to plan how they will add depth and challenge to children’s learning</li>
<li>a partnership approach involving parents and whānau in the process.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should consider how this process can assist with maximising all learning opportunities for children and further encouraging children to be independent and develop their self-help skills.</p><p>Information about transition to school information is readily available for parents. Families and children are well supported by teachers during this time. The team should consider how well the ‘ready-for-school’ programme is aligned with the philosophy.</p><p>Professional leaders work collaboratively to provide ongoing support and guidance for teachers. A shared leadership approach, where teachers are provided opportunities to use their strengths and skills to support the programme, is highly evident.</p><p>Children are provided with many opportunities to take on leadership roles. Children with additional needs are well supported and monitored by teachers. They liaise with parents and external agencies when appropriate.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well targeted, ongoing support and guidance for staff. They promote regular professional development opportunities and systems that are focused on positive outcomes for children. Recently implemented performance appraisal processes have the potential to enhance teachers' practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, teachers and leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen and embed the redeveloped assessment and planning process using self review to evaluate its effectiveness</li>
<li>define, with the team and the current kindergarten community, what success for Māori as Maori and success for Pacific mean and continually evaluate how well these priorities are responded to over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Matariki Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matariki Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>8 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
