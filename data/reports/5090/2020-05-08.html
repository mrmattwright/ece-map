</table><p>Parnell Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parnell Kindergarten is licensed for 30 children over two years of age. It operates from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm. There are small numbers of children from MƒÅori and other diverse ethnicities enrolled. The philosophy values play-based learning, a commitment to bicultural practice, and celebrating cultural diversity.</p><p>The teaching team includes an acting head teacher and two other registered teachers. The team is supported by a teacher aide and an administrator.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified positive aspects of practice, including a stimulating learning environment, and a curriculum that was responsive to children's interests and parents' aspirations. These aspects continue to be present. Areas for improvement included continuing to deepen evaluative self review and enhancing the sense of community through culturally responsive practices. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides leadership, a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel, and programmes of professional learning and development. A revised operation manual has recently been introduced by AKA.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the AKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently approach teachers for support, and to engage in conversation with them. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and have formed friendships with peers.</p><p>Children play and explore with and alongside each other in a purposeful and engaging learning environment. Teachers have created areas that reflect individual children's cultures and <span lang="mi">papat≈´ƒÅnuku</span> (nature/earth). Children respect the space and resources, and quickly settle into the day, finding things that interest them. They have good opportunities to sustain their play.</p><p>Teachers interact with children in positive and respectful ways. They implement a bicultural curriculum. Teachers have identified they want to continue to grow their confidence and skill in using <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori</span> naturally in conversations with children. AKA support and teachers' commitment to inclusive practice, ensures that children, including those with additional learning needs, experience positive outcomes.</p><p>Teachers know children and their whƒÅnau, and their response to individual children's cultures is visible in practices and documentation. Parents who spoke with ERO appreciate the teachers' contribution to their children's learning. They comment that teachers are approachable, open-minded, and provide parents with opportunities to share their culture.</p><p>Teachers have used their knowledge of <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, to support them to develop a local curriculum that aligns strongly with their philosophy. Parents and children engage with the philosophy in meaningful ways.</p><p>Children's assessment records identify their interests, and dispositions. Parent contributions form a part of the documentation. Teachers regularly meet to plan the programme and reflect on the learning outcomes for children. They could strengthen assessment by documenting the effectiveness of teaching strategies and the impact of the curriculum in extending children's learning.</p><p>Teachers use a suitable framework to record their improvement-focused internal evaluation. They are collaborative, seek multiple perspectives, and are systematic and deliberate in their inquiries.</p><p>AKA continues to provide support for kindergartens to strengthen bicultural practices. Specialist support impacts positively on teachers‚Äô confidence and on the inclusion of children with additional learning needs. AKA is currently considering ways to strengthen the role of Parent WhƒÅnau Groups in all kindergartens. The strategic direction established by AKA leaders is providing a positive framework for kindergartens‚Äô annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that key next steps include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop effective teaching strategies to extend children's play and exploration to add complexity to their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation by identifying specific, measurable indicators to assess the impact of improvements made on the outcomes for children, whƒÅnau and teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>AKA leaders agree that next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>quality assurance by monitoring that the individual kindergarten's procedures, and the recording of aspects related to children's health and safety, align with AKA policies and meet licensing requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation at all levels of the AKA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parnell Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>8 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
