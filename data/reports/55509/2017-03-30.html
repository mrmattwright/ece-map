</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Queen St is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart, (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd), is a large national organisation that owns early learning services throughout New Zealand.</p><p>Full time and sessional education and care is provided for 72 children including 22 aged up to two years. The current roll of 55 children includes 18 who identify as Māori.</p><p>A centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre. She is supported by a business and professional services manager (PSM), who work across the region for BestStart.</p><p>ERO’s March 2014 evaluation recommended that the centre continue the focus on promoting children's cultures, languages and identities in the programme, especially in relation to Māori and Pacific children; and strengthen the planned approach to review and evaluation. Progress in these areas is evident.</p><p>There have been a number of changes in centre management since the previous ERO review. A new centre manager and head teacher were appointed in 2016. This has provided stability for the teaching team.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four in BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have access to a learning environment that promotes their independence. Attractive play spaces are well organised and resources are readily accessible. Children work individually or with their peers often engaging in sustained play. A wide range of learning experiences is provided. Literacy, mathematics, and science are valued and highly promoted.</p><p>The values expressed in the recently reviewed philosophy statement are highly evident in the programme. Positive interactions between teachers and children contribute to the settled learning environment. Children appear happy and engaged. Teachers' respectful and collaborative practices result in a calm, unhurried environment where children and their families feel welcome and valued.</p><p>Children requiring additional learning support are identified and external agencies' guidance is accessed when required.</p><p>Comfortable, safe spaces are provided for those infants who are not yet mobile. Teachers have an unhurried, respectful approach. They respond to children's verbal and non-verbal cues with descriptive language to promote and extend vocabulary. Resources reflect children's current and emerging interests.</p><p>Teachers have developed a collaborative and visual approach to planning for learning that is inclusive of parent's contribution. Children participate in the development of the planned programme which is responsive to their interests. Specific teaching strategies are identified to support their learning. Regular entries in e-portfolios provide information about their engagement in the programme and developing friendships. At times parents provide feedback about their children's entries and share stories from home.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that teachers' approach to assessment requires further strengthening to more clearly show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>how parents' aspirations are responded to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's progress in learning over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledgement of children's cultures, languages and identities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Bicultural practice is highly evident. Thoughtful consideration has been given to acknowledging the cultural backgrounds of children and their families throughout the environment and the programme. Culturally significant events are celebrated. Aspects of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are evident in teachers' practice. Waiata Māori are popular with children. Teachers acknowledge that further strengthening their knowledge of te ao Māori should support them to better understand and promote educational success for Māori learners. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><p>Leaders have identified that support is required to improve teachers' understanding of the <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017.</em></p><p>Children's transitions into and through the centre are thoughtfully considered and made in collaboration with families and whānau. Teachers' developing relationships with local schools and children's participation in a BestStart initiative provide good support for them as they move onto school.</p><p>A clear framework is in place to guide the appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment and has a developmental focus. Leaders formal observations of teacher practice are providing useful information about the quality of teaching. Implementing practices that reflect teaching as inquiry should further strengthen the process. Teachers participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>Teachers' implementation of self review is guided by the organisation's collaborative and reflective approach. Planned and spontaneous reviews are becoming established practices. To strengthen internal evaluation processes teachers should deepen the analysis of the evidence collected to better inform their judgements about the quality of practices and the impact of changes on outcomes for children.</p><p>The PSM provides regular in-depth feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. She clearly identifies strengths and areas for development. The PSM, in partnership with centre leaders, should continue to monitor the progress made by staff as a result of these ERO recommendations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, leaders and management agree that the next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' knowledge and understanding of strategies to support educational success for Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation practices including monitoring the impact of changes on children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' approach to assessment to show children's progress in learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Queen St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Queen St will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>30 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
