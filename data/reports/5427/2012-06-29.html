<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro is located in the West Coast rural town of Greymouth. The experienced and qualified teaching team works effectively together to cater for the learning and well-being of children within a diverse community.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Pike River Mine disaster 2010 and the Canterbury earthquakes during 2010 &ndash; 2011. The association and the kindergarten teachers have provided a high level of support to children and families.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the way teachers give priority to fostering a welcoming environment and supportive relationships with children and families</li>
<li>the way that parent and family participation and contribution to the programme is being highly valued</li>
<li>the caring and respectful ways that teachers work with children to promote exploratory play and problem solving</li>
<li>the wide range of interesting learning experiences and resources that encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and investigation</li>
<li>the way children make extensive use of the spacious outdoor area that strongly reflects the natural West Coast environment.</li>
</ul><p>The education services manager and the teaching team have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to strengthen the documentation of recent developments in assessment, planning and self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and teachers.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The teachers&rsquo; vision statement places an emphasis on aspiring to promote life-long, collaborative learning within a respectful, welcoming West Coast environment. They are focused on fostering positive and supportive relationships with children and families. The learning programme is underpinned by Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Teachers give priority to providing a welcoming environment for children and families. They model care and respect for one another and for children. They communicate effectively and work well together and with children in ways that empower children and develop their sense of responsibility. They interact with children and families in calm and respectful ways with a focus on developing positive and reciprocal partnerships with families.</p><p>Teachers highly value parent contributions to the programme. Many parents spend time at the kindergarten and are comfortable to be involved in activities with their children. Teachers make time to talk with parents to support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being.</p><p>Children demonstrate a good sense of belonging and settle quickly at activities of interest. They benefit from a good range of interesting activities and learning experiences and have ready access to resources to add to play ideas. Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s sustained involvement in activity to develop their ideas.</p><p>The teachers provide an inclusive learning environment. They listen attentively to children. They are very responsive to the individual interests and needs of children and encourage them to make their own choices and develop self-help skills.</p><p>Teachers make good use of questioning and respond in ways that develop children&rsquo;s oral language and conversation skills.</p><p>Teachers challenge children by prompting them to explore things in different ways and encouraging them to problem solve. They place a strong focus on exploratory and sensory play.</p><p>Many children play well with and alongside others for substantial lengths of time. They initiate and maintain relationships with others. ERO observed children caring for one another, playing cooperatively and sharing ideas. Teachers and children have fun together.</p><p>Children benefit from a well organised and maintained learning environment. The spacious outdoor learning area strongly reflects the natural West Coast environment. Children make extensive use of this are where they have many opportunities to be involved in physical play and to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</p><p>Teachers have developed a reflective culture that focused on ongoing improvement of teaching practices to extend on children&rsquo;s learning. They are currently trialling different approaches to assessment, planning and self review.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p>The teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the use of assessment information to identify specific directions for learning and teaching that will add depth and complexity to individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the identification of children&rsquo;s learning progress</li>
<li>the recent developments in programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>self-review practices so that they can consistently review the quality of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The experienced and qualified teaching team works effectively together to cater for the learning and well-being of children within a diverse community.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Pike River Mine disaster 2010 and the Canterbury earthquakes during 2010 &ndash; 2011. The association and the kindergarten teachers have provided a high level of support to children and families.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the way teachers give priority to fostering a welcoming environment and supportive relationships with children and families</li>
<li>the way that parent and family participation and contribution to the programme is being highly valued</li>
<li>the caring and respectful ways that teachers work with children to promote exploratory play and problem solving</li>
<li>the wide range of interesting learning experiences and resources that encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and investigation</li>
<li>the way children make extensive use of the spacious outdoor area that strongly reflects the natural West Coast environment.</li>
</ul><p>The education services manager and the teaching team have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to strengthen the documentation of recent developments in assessment, planning and self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of kindergarten&rsquo;s performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
