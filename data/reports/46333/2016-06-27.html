</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>RIverstones Early Learning Centre is a purpose-built, privately-owned centre in the township of Lumsden. It opened in 2013 to provide education and care for up to 33 children from a widespread rural catchment.</p><p>Children play and learn in attractive, well-resourced spaces. There are separate spaces that cater for the specific needs of infants and toddlers, with flexibility for all children to play and learn together.</p><p>The owner manages the operation of the centre, as well as leading teaching and learning. All teachers are early childhood or primary trained, and are fully registered or working towards becoming fully registered teachers. There have been some changes in staff since the centre opened.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's sense of belonging is well supported. They are warmly welcomed and settle quickly into the programme. The owner and teachers actively foster caring and respectful relationships between children and adults. Children have strong friendships with each other and are supported to play well together. Teachers know children and their families well. They use a variety of ways to communicate with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Teachers use their knowledge of children's interests and family lives to provide a wide range of learning experiences. They make useful links within the local and wider community to support children's learning. The owner and teachers have positive relationships with local schools.</p><p>Teachers use specific ways to support children's language development. They deliberately include aspects of early literacy, mathematics and science within the programme. Children hear and use some te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia.</p><p>While children are familiar and comfortable with routines, teachers need to evaluate how effective these routines are in meeting the needs of individuals and groups of children.</p><p>Children's transitions into and within the centre are well supported. Infants and toddlers benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>nurturing and caring relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a settled and calm environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low ratios that enable one-to-one responsive interactions between them and their teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are developing a shared understanding of planning for groups and individual children. They now need to consistently gather parents' wishes for their children's learning and show how these are responded to. Teachers have explicit guidelines for writing learning stories that provide a model of good practice. They now need to ensure that these guidelines are used effectively. Group planning needs to clearly show the intended learning and the strategies and experiences teachers will use to extend children's learning.</p><p>The owner provides strong leadership, has high expectations for herself and staff, and is committed to continuous improvement. She has developed effective systems for managing the day-to-day operation of the centre. With the teachers and community she has identified areas for ongoing development, including the design of a bicultural curriculum. These areas need to be prioritised in future planning.</p><p>The teachers and owner are in the early stages of developing their understanding and use of effective self review. They have made some improvements to practices and centre operation as a result of spontaneous reviews.</p><p>The owner and teachers have built a collaborative team culture. The owner identifies teachers' individual strengths and is building their skills and capabilities. She actively seeks appropriate professional development to respond to identified needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and teachers have made significant progress in establishing the centre. They agree with ERO that there are a number of key next steps to support their vision for high quality education and care. These include further developing and strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the philosophy to identify the centre‚Äôs desired learning for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation for individual and groups of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning partnerships with parents and reflecting children's culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>long-term planning that is aligned to important aspects of the centre, reflects MƒÅori perspectives, and is regularly monitored and evaluated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified, and the owner agrees, that aspects of self review need to be improved.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverstones Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Riverstones Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
