<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Lower Hutt Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Strong leadership, a well-organised approach to management and high levels of commitment from parents support sustained good practice and improvement.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association). Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association&rsquo;s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>At the time of this review the centre provides five mixed-age and two SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education) sessions each week. The mixed-age sessions are predominately parent-supervised. Members are drawn from a wide geographical area. They demonstrate high levels of commitment to training and playcentre philosophy.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in improving the daily operation and management of the service, since the 2011 ERO review. Self review has been a particular focus of their development. The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</em></p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of inclusive practice, working together, the bicultural environment and play to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Members&rsquo; practice strongly reflects the centre philosophy. Their inclusive and well-considered approach provides good support for a diverse range of learning needs. All children are encouraged to investigate, explore, interact with others and have fun. Adults are responsive and purposeful in their engagement, particularly in relation to promoting social and language learning.</p><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children's independence and confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials which are well organised and freely available to children. The outdoor area supports physically active play and adventurous activities. Sustained free play and creative self expression are encouraged. Literacy and language are well integrated into the programme in the context of play. Well developed photographic displays provide good opportunities for adults and children to reflect on playcentre events and their involvement in activities. The calm tone reflects the settled, sustained involvement of children in their play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are valued members of the playcentre community. They are acknowledged as competent learners and provided with a carefully-considered range of resources to support their care and learning.</p><p>A process is in place, including a school visit, to support families transitioning to school. A next step is to further develop the relationship with the local school.</p><p>The association actively promotes bicultural partnership. A M&#257;ori perspective is strongly evident in the centre environment. A parent, who has taken on the role of bicultural officer actively supports others to integrate te ao M&#257;ori into the programme. Children are very aware of protocols and aspects of te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p>The daily programme is strongly child-led. Parents are well supported to understand and take part in planning for learning. Session evaluation is well developed and supports the ongoing sharing of information about children&rsquo;s interests, learning and development needs and how the programme will respond to these. Members intend to develop a visual diary to improve planning on a daily basis. Portfolios provide visual records of children&rsquo;s participation at playcentre.</p><p>The centre has strong leadership. Guidelines, records and reporting are well organised, up-to-date and easy to follow. Members are highly committed to ongoing improvement and fostering the involvement of others in the management of the programme and daily operation. Strengthening the quality of induction for new families has been a particularly successful focus.</p><p>The friendly culture, well-developed communication and support for each other, foster parents&rsquo; confidence and willingness to become involved in leadership roles and training. Adults take pride in being part of a learning community alongside their children. Many families retain membership until children move on to school. Their strong sense of belonging and commitment to playcentre philosophy points to a positive future for this service.</p><p>Members show a well-developed understanding of the purpose and value of self review. Frameworks provided by the association have been put to good use. Members are highly reflective and make regular opportunities for discussion about the children and programme aimed at improvement.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members&rsquo; practice. A more formalised approach focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It effectively works alongside members to support self management. The centre makes good use of association systems and processes to ensure legislative requirements are met, good practice is sustained and improvement is promoted.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further development is needed to strengthen centre members&rsquo; approach to assessment, planning and evaluation, particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>highlighting children's significant learning and adults&rsquo; responses in portfolios</li>
<li>Illustrating progressions of learning</li>
<li>continuing to develop members&rsquo; understanding of early learning</li>
</ul><p>Members should continue building their understanding and use of self review, particularly in relation to building quality improvement in key aspects of practice. Further development of strategic and annual planning processes is also timely</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lower Hutt Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
