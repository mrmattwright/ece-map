</table><p>Wakari Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.&nbsp;</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wakari Kindergarten is located in the hill suburb of Wakari in Dunedin. It is one of 24 kindergartens in the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). This is the only kindergarten in the DK to offer morning sessions for older children and afternoon sessions for younger children. A weekly playgroup is a meeting place for prospective parents and children before starting kindergarten.</p><p>The teachers are experienced, qualified and have worked together for a considerable time. They value the positive relationships they have with the children's families and the wider community. They aim for children to have fun as they learn. A parent committee actively raises funds for new resources and organises social events for families. The teachers have developed close links with local schools and external agencies.</p><p>The team has worked on the recommendations from the July 2012 ERO report, however self review still requires further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from the inclusive and welcoming atmosphere teachers have created in the kindergarten. Teachers foster and develop caring relationships with children. They have created a culture where children are valued and affirmed for who they are. They provide strong support for families and work with them in the best interests of their children. Teachers seek parents&rsquo; wishes for their children&rsquo;s learning and are seeking ways to do this more regularly and especially in ways that are preferred by M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. Wall displays and social media help parents to know about the learning in the kindergarten.</p><p>Children are settled in the programme. They benefit from consistent routines and teachers&rsquo; high expectations about how to play and learn together. They play well, have fun and enjoy the company of their friends. The outdoor environment is well planned and provides choice and challenge for children and encourages exploration. Children independently choose from a wide range of resources indoors.</p><p>Teachers have purposeful learning conversations with children. They intentionally:</p><ul>
<li>extend children&rsquo;s thinking by building on their ideas</li>
<li>make connections to children&rsquo;s home lives</li>
<li>build on children&rsquo;s oral language skills.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers incorporate te reo M&#257;ori and M&#257;ori perspectives into the programme. They draw on the knowledge and skills of parents to support them with this. Teachers have identified that implementing a rich bicultural curriculum is a work in progress. They should include this focus in long-term planning to ensure progress is sustained.</p><p>Key features of the programme that enhance children&rsquo;s learning include many opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>early mathematics and literacy</li>
<li>gardening and caring for the environment</li>
<li>exploring science and the arts</li>
<li>creativity and construction</li>
<li>making connections with and being part of the wider community.</li>
</ul><p>The group programme is based on teachers&rsquo; knowledge of children and is carefully thought out with strategies and experiences. Teachers have found weekly written evaluations an effective way to share information and provide continuity of teaching within the programme. These would be even more effective if they were evaluative rather than descriptive.</p><p>Profile books show many aspects of each child&rsquo;s learning journey and children enjoy revisiting their experiences in their books. It is timely for teachers to review the effectiveness of assessment practices to ensure the good practices identified are consistently implemented for all children.</p><p>The experienced teaching team shares the various roles and responsibilities and works well together. Teachers have a strong commitment to teaching and learning. They are thoughtful and knowledgeable. There are useful systems for the daily running of the kindergarten.</p><p>The association has provided teachers with a useful format to support self review. Teachers have made some positive changes, however self review would be strengthened by teachers making more effective use of indicators throughout all stages of a review.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are responsive to the identified needs of children and families within the association, and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, senior teacher and ERO agree that the next steps for the kindergarten&rsquo;s ongoing improvement journey are to:</p><p>continue to strengthen aspects of self review and assessment</p><p>ensure the kindergarten philosophy makes clear what is valued as important learning for children and includes teachers&rsquo; commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association's vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent, high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wakari Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wakari Kindergarten will be in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>4 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
