</table><p>Kidlywinks Childcare Centre¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Changes in key staff and leadership have occurred in 2018.¬† Leaders and teachers should benefit from time and some support to establish shared understanding of expectations for, and a cohesive team approach to, teaching and provision of the learning programme<strong>. </strong></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidlywinks Childcare Centre is a privately owned early learning service located in Trentham, Upper Hutt. It caters for 31 children, including up to 10 aged under two. Of the 39 children enrolled, eight are MƒÅori. Children work together in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>The owner (and curriculum leader) and two senior staff make up the leadership team. Of the seven teachers (kaiako) employed, three are registered. There have been some recent staff and leadership changes. Four new kaiako have been permanently employed in the last six months. One permanent teaching position remains vacant.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of respectful and collaborative working relationships, and promoting children‚Äôs independence, needs and interests in line with the intent of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>The March 2016 ERO review identified that teachers needed to develop a shared understanding of high quality teaching practice. In addition, there was need to review assessment and planning practices strengthen the bicultural curriculum. These continue to be areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The daily programme is largely child led. A range of learning materials is available to support children's interests and learning. They have choices about where, when and with whom they will play throughout the day. Meal times are flexible to enable them to complete their self-chosen activities.</p><p>Kaiako are kind and responsive. Some newer staff are still building relationships with children and familiarity with routines. Leaders should ensure all kaiako have the time and opportunities to deeply engage with individuals in meaningful and purposeful learning activities. Priority should also be given to improved play-based integration of literacy and mathematics, and support for children's creativity and perseverance in self-chosen play.</p><p>Leaders continue to strive to build purposeful partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. Families' aspirations for their children's learning are sought. Parent/kaiako interviews are held to share children's learning progress and seek parents' views. Use of on-line platforms that showcase children's participation in programme activities is improving communication between the centre and homes.¬†</p><p>Children's transitions are facilitated with care. New enrolments are supported by ongoing consultation with their parents and a focus on their wellbeing. A range of initiatives assist with children's move to primary school. As a next step, leaders should seek to develop purposeful relationships with new entrant teachers to share details of individual children's learning and support the continuity of their learning.</p><p>The curriculum leader shows strong commitment to the implementation of a culturally responsive curriculum. A bicultural perspective is becoming evident in parts of the programme. Professional development has been sought to support the team's understanding and consider a way forward. Kaiako should continue to seek study options and links with local MƒÅori to support their approach.</p><p>Further development of provision for infants and toddlers is required to better support their inclusion, engagement and persistence in play and learning.</p><p>The team leader has recently introduced a new approach to planning for learning that incorporates kaiako and parent input into children's learning goals. In order to strengthen the process kaiako should: place greater emphasis on children's significant learning and needs; better define the strategies they plan to use to progress the learning; and measure their effectiveness in order to clearly determine next teaching and learning steps. The team leader should define indicators of success for this new process to support improved implementation and decisions about how well the approach is working.</p><p>Individual learning portfolios record aspects of some children's participation and learning. The quality of these learning records is variable. The team leader plans to redefine which children should have portfolios and improve their ongoing access to them. ERO's evaluation supports these decisions. Strengthening consistency and quality, and better integrating cultural perspectives are also next steps.</p><p>With changes in leadership and teaching staff, leaders are working to re-establish shared understanding of expectations and cohesive teamwork to more effectively implement the learning programme.</p><p>Good support for staff development is in place. An induction process for new staff and professional learning opportunities are offered. Useful appraisal assists teachers to grow their practice. Further work is necessary to define what <em>The Standards for the Teaching Profession</em> mean in relation to this centre's practice, and improve the quality of appraiser feedback/feedforward.</p><p>A suitable framework for internal evaluation has been adopted. Next steps are for the curriculum leader to further clarify her understanding of the process and work with teachers to support their mastery and participation.</p><p>Some aspects of management of the service are well developed. A vision, philosophy and appropriate range of policy guidelines are in place to provide direction for teaching, learning and operation. However, long-term development planning needs improvement. There should be an increased focus on measurable outcomes for children and ongoing monitoring and review of progress in relation to goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p class="TableParagraph">Priorities for this service are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of teaching and aspects of the curriculum</li>
<li>planning for learning</li>
<li>leadership for teaching and learning</li>
<li>long-term planning and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidlywinks Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, and governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that adults providing education and care engage in meaningful, positive interactions to enhance children's learning and nurture reciprocal relationships</li>
<li>ensure that information is provided for parents about the amount and details of the expenditure of any Ministry of Education funding received by the service.<br> <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C3, GMA3</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice the service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>check the rubber impact surfacing under the play equipment is still fit for purpose</li>
<li>check that noise levels in the playroom are within a safe range.</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review the centre manager has taken steps to address these.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidlywinks Childcare Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Director Review and Improvement Services Southern<br>Southern Region</p><p>18 February 2019¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
