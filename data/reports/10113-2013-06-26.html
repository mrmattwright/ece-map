<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Little Angels Childcare &amp; Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Little Angels Childcare is a privately owned, mixed-aged centre in Half Moon Bay, Auckland. It caters for children from the local and wider community. The environment is organised around an attractive outdoor play area and garden, and a large room divided into inviting learning spaces.</p><p>The owner maintains financial and governance responsibilities and shares the leadership of the centre with the centre manager. The centre has a well established teaching team. Close relationships have been built with families over time.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s mission statement and philosophy are about providing children with holistic high quality care and education, influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and learning. Teachers strive to provide an environment in which each child is able to reach his or her full potential. The centre philosophy acknowledges the importance of partnership with family.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s 2010 ERO report noted the good care and learning opportunities provided for children and the positive relationships between staff and families. ERO commended the way the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of child-initiated play was reflected in all areas of practice. These good practices continue to be evident.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has an inclusive, caring family atmosphere and teachers know children and their families well. Teachers&rsquo; calm and gentle interactions support a programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s preferences and routines.</p><p>The learning environment is inviting. Teachers make good use of natural materials to stimulate children&rsquo;s play. Learning resources enable children to enjoy a range of experiences in long periods of uninterrupted play. M&#257;ori themes and bilingual signage are reflected throughout the environment.</p><p>Children play and learn together cooperatively and positively. These respectful interactions enable older children to be role models and leaders, and encourage them to care for younger children. The Reggio Emilia approach means that children are encouraged to explore and engage in their learning and to develop a sense of well being and belonging in the centre.</p><p>Teachers support children to be curious and to make choices as they work quietly alongside them to support their play. They help children to develop communication skills and children enjoy participating in conversations with adults and each other.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s assessment records are available to parents and children and provide good information about children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme and relationships in the centre. The aspirations of families could now be more formally documented to support programme planning and to reflect parent perspectives in children&rsquo;s learning and development. This documentation would be particularly useful when children move between groups and go on to school.</p><p>Families benefit from good processes and information to support children&rsquo;s transition to local schools. Class visits and the children&rsquo;s participation in school events help build children&rsquo;s confidence and provide continuity in their new relationships with adults and children.</p><p>Centre managers support teachers to have a shared understanding of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and approaches to teaching. Teachers could now evaluate programmes in more depth, with a focus on what they are learning about children and their own teaching practice. This more targeted evaluation would provide useful information to support continual improvement in professional practice.</p><p>Centre managers are developing their use of self review through a variety of approaches. A greater focus on working with evidence from a range of perspectives would support their decision making and help identify priorities for development. This self review should also support the centre owner in developing the centre&rsquo;s strategic vision and effective annual management plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders discussed the following key next steps to support ongoing centre improvement and agree that centre managers and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>document the ways in which children&rsquo;s interests and parents&rsquo; aspirations are used to plan programmes</li>
<li>evaluate programmes in more depth</li>
<li>strengthen their understanding of self review as a means to ongoing improvement</li>
<li>develop and review strategic and annual plans so that they reflect the centre philosophy and vision</li>
<li>update teacher appraisals so that they support teachers&rsquo; professional growth and reflect the criteria for teacher registration.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre managers prioritise reviewing policies and practices to ensure that they align with the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Little Angels Childcare &amp; Learning Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the licensee must:</p><ul>
<li>review the indoor centre environment and take all practicable steps to ensure that displayed artefacts and other items are secure and will not fall and cause injury in an earthquake</li>
<li>ensure that when children leave the premises on an outing or excursion, a risk assessment and management process is undertaken, and that adult-to-child ratios are determined accordingly.</li>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
