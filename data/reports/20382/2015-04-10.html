</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (5) Remuera provides education and care for 50 children including up to 20 children under two years of age. The children attending the centre are predominantly New Zealand European, Chinese and Middle European.</p><p>The Kindercare organisation provides management and administrative systems, including a policy and procedural framework. Centre staff receive ongoing professional support from a regional manager. The guiding philosophy for the centre is common to all Kindercare centres.</p><p>The centre director was appointed in 2013 and leads the centre with lead teachers in each of the three rooms. Children are cared for in three age-related groups. The first of these groups is for babies and toddlers up to two years of age. The second room is for children two to three years of age. The third room is for three to five year olds and is the transition to school room. There is flexibility in the transitioning of children between rooms, dependent on their readiness to move to the next stage. All children have access to outdoor areas that make good use of available space.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended that the centre needed to recognise and promote the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/ New Zealand. It was also recommended that staff deepen their understanding of how to evaluate and respond to children‚Äôs ongoing learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children are settled and comfortable in their environment and move easily into their chosen activity. The centre philosophy focuses on providing children with safe, loving learning environments.</p><p>Relationships between children and teachers are respectful, nurturing and affirming. Teachers respond well to children‚Äôs needs. They provide babies with a focused and nurturing quality of care. The respectful quality of relationships throughout the centre support children‚Äôs capacity, confidence and capability to learn. Children are trusting and confident of each other and their teachers. Children in all areas of the centre show a sense of belonging and wellbeing, playing independently and cooperatively alongside each other.</p><p>Learning is child-centred at all age levels and learning topics are generated by the interests of children. These ideas and interests are being increasingly developed as project-based learning. Teachers ensure relevant connected activities are provided to challenge and provoke children‚Äôs play and creativity.</p><p>Children‚Äôs interests and developmental progress are recorded in individual learning journals. Teachers are continuing to refine journals so they better reflect children's learning progress. Babies‚Äô journals provide a daily account of their progress and events and promote good home centre communication. Teachers are committed to involving families in partnership and are successfully working to achieve this outcome.</p><p>Teachers participate in rich and meaningful professional learning and development. The centre director has a good understanding of the need to improve self review processes and how this could positively impact teachers' professional capacity and the children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>Children experience smooth well-supported transitions between rooms. The unhurried pace of transitions fosters children's confidence, sense of place and well being. Readiness for school is integrated in the transition to school programme. Teachers have a good understanding of the importance of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to enable children to be well prepared for school.</p><p>The centre has identified that it needs to build teachers‚Äô bicultural capacity. This will mean that children and families can expect to increasingly hear te reo MƒÅori being spoken, waiata being sung and see an environment that indicates the centre is biculturally aware and supporting te Ao MƒÅori.</p><p>As a result of internal self review, the centre has changed the room layouts. They are colour coordinated and homely environments. Teachers could provide more opportunities for children to revisit their learning through visual displays of the programme in action.</p><p>The centre director provides very good leadership. She is committed to advancing the professional capacity of teaching and learning and developing a learning community. In the short time she has been director she has made positive decisions to lead the centre forward. This leadership model is providing opportunities for teachers to improve their practice and build a strong sense of team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the director and teachers are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>a strategic plan that provides direction for development in all areas of centre operations and is regularly reviewed</li>
<li>plans to ensure that bicultural practice becomes an integral part of the centre‚Äôs curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre (5) Remuera completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centre (5) Remuera will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
