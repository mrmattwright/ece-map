</table><p>Just Four Kids Ltd is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Just Four Kids Ltd is a family-owned, home-based early childhood care and education service. The directors are fully involved in the day-to-day operation of the service. This report refers to one of two networks owned and operated by the same service. This network caters for the care and education of infants, toddlers and young children in home-care environments within the Invercargill and Gore areas.</p><p>The two visiting teachers who provide a range of support, are qualified and registered early childhood teachers who were appointed in Term 1 2017. They work closely with the visiting teachers in the other network. Together they provide a weekly whānau playgroup and regular excursions for educators and children.</p><p>The director has developed some useful links with other early childhood professionals and agencies that provide professional learning opportunities.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The director and visiting teachers foster positive and respectful relationships with educators and families to promote children’s sense of wellbeing. Children and parents are well supported to make a successful transition into the care arrangement.</p><p>The visiting teacher from the service’s second network is providing high level support, along with the director, to induct new visiting teachers and promote a reflective team culture. Educator appraisal is well used to inform service priorities. There is a very well planned approach to good quality, regular professional learning and development (PLD) for educators, visiting teachers, parents and directors.</p><p>The director and visiting teachers have a number of systems to support educators to share learning. Visiting teachers work collaboratively and value the educators' views and ideas, and are responsive to their needs. Their well-written reports are detailed and help to build educators' assessment capability. Visiting teachers provide useful feedback to educators to improve their teaching and ways to extend children's learning. Useful communication systems have increased parents', and whānau contributions to children’s learning.</p><p>Visiting teachers and educators understand and value the home setting. Importance is placed on children learning through play and enjoying meaningful everyday experiences around the home and in the community. An appropriate focus on science and mathematics is evident.</p><p>The visiting teacher and educators place importance on providing nurturing care for infants and toddlers and the provision of routines that align to parent preferences.</p><p>The children's culture, language and identity is acknowledged and valued. Leaders are committed to culturally responsive practices. They successfully promote te reo Māori and celebrate Pacific languages within the service and learning community.</p><p>Leaders are focused on ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children. They have high expectations and work to remove barriers to learning, including quickly responding to individual needs and any concerns. Leaders are introducing and strengthening a number of internal systems to support sustainable practice and the growth of the service. Educators are well supported to be effective in providing education and safe learning environments for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders recognise that a number of systems and practices are at an early stage. They have high expectations. Internal evaluation is beginning to be used to support sustainable practice and the provision of an effective learning environment. Service leaders and ERO agree that priority should now be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing understanding of in-depth internal evaluation and developing a framework to guide practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing appraisal and attestation processes to align to the Education Council requirements for registered teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a programme for provisionally registered teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring consistency of the quality of assessment, including explicit goal setting and progress of learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop leadership capability for newly-appointed visiting teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Four Kids Ltd completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The service has a range of formal and informal systems for managing health and safety requirements. In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure:</p><p>that the service is fully compliant with all aspects of the Vulnerable Children's Act for personnel and child protection, including the direct reporting of any suspected child abuse.</p><p>Since the on-site stage of the review the service provider has improved this centre's provisions for ensuring that all educators hold a current first-aid certificate prior to caring for children.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Just Four Kids Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>30 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
