</table><p>Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.¬†</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool is a Tongan language immersion service in Papatoetoe, Auckland. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including up to five children aged under two years. Most of the children attending are Tongan.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance of the Tongan Catholic Chaplaincy with a management committee of church, parent, and staff representatives. The centre has three registered teachers who are supported by three other staff.</p><p>The centre has had a variable reporting history with ERO. The 2013 ERO report recommended that teachers and managers enact the centre philosophy and develop effective performance management systems to improve the quality of teaching practice. The centre has responded positively to that report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is now evident in practice. Adults promote Catholic and Tongan values and the programme for children is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children are settled in an attractive learning environment. They are confident and know centre routines well. Generally supportive, positive interactions among children and teachers have fostered children's sense of belonging. Children have good opportunities to explore and make choices in their play. They enjoy singing and movement.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken professional learning to develop their practices and planning in order to improve the programme for children. The programme is increasingly responsive to the children's interests with a focus on learning through play. Teachers follow children's lead and support their play. The programme for children also promotes children's health through nutrition and exercise. Learning stories have a clear focus and celebrate children's learning.</p><p>Teachers model Tongan language and children are encouraged to converse in Tongan. Children are also developing an appreciation of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>A separate indoor play space is provided for younger children to spend some of their day. Infants and toddlers mix well with other children and are well supported to develop independence. It would be timely to review the adequacy of resources to support play for these children.</p><p>The committee and head teacher have improved the centre's policy framework, strategic planning and personnel management. A process for self review has been established to promote ongoing improvement in centre practices. Staff appraisal has been implemented and can be further strengthened to meet recent Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers discussed the following priorities for development. To extend children's learning opportunities in a child centred programme, teachers should increase the level of challenge. They should develop children's thinking, creativity and expression by:</p><ul>
<li>planning a programme that encourages children's curiosity and discovery, promoting more opportunities for them to develop their oral skills in the Tongan language by sharing their experiences, questions and opinions</li>
<li>ensuring there is adequate provision of challenging learning resources to support children's play</li>
<li>strengthening interactions that facilitate play.</li>
</ul><p>To ensure ongoing improvements in centre practices, managers should:</p><ul>
<li>use <em>He Pou TƒÅtaki</em> <em>to develop and evaluate key strategic goals</em></li>
<li><em>ensure current legislative requirements are incorporated in regular policy review</em></li>
<li><em>incorporate indicators of effective practice in the centre's self</em><em>-</em><em>review processes</em></li>
<li><em>rationalise the appraisal process to focus on the</em> <em>Practising Teachers' Criteria</em><em>.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, the committee should ensure centre policies are rationalised, dated and are current with legislative changes.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
