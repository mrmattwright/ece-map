</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mosgiel Central Kindergarten provides education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten moved to a brand-new, purpose-built building and playground in 2015. The teachers place high importance on children being self managing and making decisions for themselves.</p><p>The kindergarten operates according to school-day hours. Some of the younger children go home at lunchtime, so 40 children attend in the mornings and 30 in the afternoons. A large number of two year olds attend.</p><p>After some leadership changes, an experienced teacher has been appointed as acting-head teacher. All the teachers are qualified. An active parent committee supports the kindergarten well with fundraising and improvements. The teachers have made significant progress on the recommendations of the 2012 ERO report.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the Dunedin Kindergartens (DK) umbrella. DK provides management and professional support for the teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm and caring relationships with their teachers. The teachers take the time to get to know the parents, form strong relationships with them, and make them feel welcome at the kindergarten. They hold events to include the whole family. The teachers use a variety of ways to show parents what children learn through their kindergarten experiences.</p><p>The teachers foster a calm and settled atmosphere which is especially valuable in helping the younger children feel at home. The children have a strong sense of belonging at the kindergarten and form their own friendships.</p><p>The teachers focus on learning. Their emphasis on children being self/managing and making decisions for themselves is clearly evident in the programme. The flexible rhythm of the day gives children choice and uninterrupted time for play. Children have a wide variety of interesting learning experiences to choose from. Extensive use of open-ended resources, such as a collection of big foam climbing blocks and a pile of driftwood, allows children to make choices, set challenges for themselves and solve problems.</p><p>The teachers talk with children in a respectful and responsive way in order to build a sense of trust and develop children‚Äôs oral language and social skills. They provide rich experiences including literacy, music, ICT and dramatic play and then engage children in conversations about what they are doing and learning. Teachers allow children time to think and reply.</p><p>Children take part in real-life learning experiences such as making their own morning tea, gardening, and caring for the kindergarten‚Äôs guinea pigs and birds. They go on regular excursions into the local community, including to the public library and to water the planter boxes in Mosgiel's main street. Children are prepared for starting school through regular visits with one local school and some contact with others.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor areas are thoughtfully and imaginatively designed. The kindergarten has many high-quality resources. It also has a variety of play spaces so children can choose an open or a cosy spot, a quiet or a more active place to play in.</p><p>Children‚Äôs awareness of te ao MƒÅori is growing through use of waiata, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and wall displays. Teachers encourage MƒÅori whƒÅnau and children to contribute their cultural knowledge to the daily programme. This is an area the teachers are continuing to strengthen.</p><p>Teachers create group plans to foster important learning for children. They have a system to plan for individual children. Parents and teachers discuss children‚Äôs interests and future learning. The children‚Äôs portfolios describe what children are learning and often show children‚Äôs progress. Teachers agree that identifying children‚Äôs next learning steps more clearly and what teachers will do to support this learning will improve their planning and assessment practices.</p><p>The acting-head teacher has strengthened systems for the kindergarten‚Äôs operation. Teachers work well as a team and value the different approach that each person brings. They have common understandings about what is important for children here. They build these understandings further through shared professional learning, readings and discussions.</p><p>The most recent self review (using the DK format) is a well-implemented and documented process. This has led to positive changes for children. The teachers need to refine their use of indicators and develop a schedule to ensure all aspects of the kindergarten‚Äôs operations are reviewed over time.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to the identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers agree that their next steps, with the support of their senior teacher, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen and build consistency in planning and assessment of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>rewrite the philosophy statement to better represent what is important for children‚Äôs learning in this kindergarten</li>
<li>develop the long-term plan so it becomes a useful guide for the kindergarten‚Äôs future</li>
<li>involve parents more consistently in making important decisions, such as in relation to the philosophy and long-term plan.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees these are appropriate next steps.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association‚Äôs vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher, it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent, high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mosgiel Central Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mosgiel Central Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>22 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
