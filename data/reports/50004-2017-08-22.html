</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Toko Playcentre is licensed for up to 30 children, including 15 aged up to two years. Thirty children are enrolled. The centre opens for mixed-age sessions, two mornings a week.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 parent-led early learning services administered by the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association). A management team of elected volunteers implements the directives from playcentre governance and provides the adult education programme, guidance and support for members.</p><p>Centre supporters are employed by the association to regularly visit playcentres. Their role is to provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. Parents share the duties associated with implementing the daily programme.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is planning a significant restructure in 2017 that includes amalgamating associations. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>The January 2014 ERO report for Toko Playcentre identified that development of self-review practice and assessment, planning and evaluation was needed. Centre members have made positive progress in responding to these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven playcentre reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The association philosophy of parent-led education and child-initiated play is valued by centre members and reflected in practice. The principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, underpin practice to promote positive outcomes for children. A commitment to honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident across the organisation.</p><p>An inclusive atmosphere encourages children to lead, challenge and experience learning as fun. The sustained commitment of members has contributed to the centre's well-embedded systems and structures.</p><p>Children are viewed as confident, competent, individual learners and explorers. Care, respect and shared responsibility for children's learning is upheld by the collective. Rituals and routines are established. Children holistically engage alongside peers and adults.</p><p>Children's interests, needs and preferences inform and guide the well-planned curriculum. Daily, weekly and termly documentation practices support adults' planning for the learning of individuals and groups of children. Adults' contributions to planning and assessment are modified and strengthened. An evaluative framework of daily and termly programmes is used. Continuing to embed planning for learning is an ongoing priority.</p><p>A deliberate focus on bicultural practices is implemented. WhƒÅnau tangata is evident. Adults apply a high level of care for their own and other children. Children support each other in tuakana teina interactions and are actively engaged. Resourcing is purposefully considered to uphold te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Te ao MƒÅori, place-based information is shared.</p><p>Portfolios are attractive and show children‚Äôs active involvement in and beyond the centre. Children‚Äôs learning progress over time is recorded. Parents uphold their children‚Äôs culture, language and identity. Approaches to grow members' understanding assessment, planning and evaluation are useful.</p><p>A well-considered transition process with local schools is in place. Information packs are provided for children and families. The positive, collaborative relationship supports children's transition interactions and experiences.</p><p>Adults have made good use of self review to strengthen assessment and planning for children's learning. More clearly showing the impact of adults' planned strategies on children's outcomes is a next step.</p><p>The association's MƒÅori representative of Puriri Whakamaru o Taranaki, supports centre members to gain further understandings of te ao MƒÅori. This aspect is developing well as an integral part of the curriculum. Association and centre leaders should use strategic planning and internal evaluation to ensure the good practice occurring is sustained and continues to be built on.</p><p>The centre support person provides useful written reports on centre environmental developments and programme practices. These have a focus on outcomes for children and identification of next steps for centre members to improve teaching and learning.</p><p>Appraisal for centre supporters requires strengthening. The process, to enhance outcomes for children and their families, should: include more focused goals that build their capability; and provide more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about supportive practices.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embed planning for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support centre members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve appraisal for the centre support people to respond to individual needs and identify professional development to grow them in their leadership roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build centre support staff knowledge and capability to undertake effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Toko Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Toko Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>22 August 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
