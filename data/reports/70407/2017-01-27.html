</table><p>Aratupu Preschool and Nursery is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aratupu Preschool and Nursery is governed and managed by the Christchurch Methodist Central Mission. It is a community hub that is particularly focused on advocating for families with additional needs and promoting equity and excellence for all children. The centre caters for the care and education of children from birth to school age.</p><p>The mission and centre staff are focussed on supporting the participation of tamariki and whƒÅnau in centre programmes. They provide additional funding to meet specific requirements, including an extra teacher, to support the individual needs of children transitioning into the centre and onto school.</p><p>All teachers, including the manager, are qualified early childhood teachers. A whƒÅnau support worker, and partnership community worker are based at the centre to support an holistic approach to the wellbeing of children and their families. Nutritious meals and snacks are provided for children.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been changes to the leadership team and some staffing. The centre manager and a core group of teachers have provided consistency for families. They have addressed the recommendations from that report, including developing a stronger focus on teaching and learning, bicultural perspectives, assessment and planning and self review.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have strong links with the wider social and education community, including a learning cluster of other early learning services and schools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have a strong, shared vision and philosophy that is very evident in practice. Teachers work collaboratively towards a culture of respect, inclusion, and are committed to the holistic wellbeing of tamariki, whƒÅnau and community.</p><p>Teachers actively foster respectful relationships with tamariki, parents and whƒÅnau. They value and respect the languages, cultures and identities of all children while embracing the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Leaders and teachers establish a culture in which tamariki are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are, and for what they bring to their learning. Tamariki are at the heart of everything that leaders, teachers and staff do.</p><p>Teachers are caring and nurturing. They strive to understand the child in the context of family, whƒÅnau and community. Teachers take time to talk with whƒÅnau and encourage them to have a voice and share information that supports children‚Äôs learning and sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers model care and respect for one another and for tamariki and whƒÅnau. They are responsive to the individual interests, strengths and capabilities of infants, toddlers and young children within a child-led curriculum. There is a strong focus on developing oral language, independence, social skills and friendships with others. Older children are encouraged to support and care for younger children (tuakana teina relationships).</p><p>Children benefit from the careful thought given to the presentation of the environment and natural resources to inspire curiosity, creativity and exploration. They adapt resources to extend children's ideas, involve themselves in physical challenges and help learn children about caring for the natural world.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs interests and participation through conversations, informative wall displays and well-written learning records. Parent involvement in their children's learning is encouraged and valued.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are very reflective. They challenge themselves, and one another to further develop teaching and learning practices. Key governance and management documentation is well aligned to short-term goals, self review, appraisal and professional development.</p><p>Leaders ensure that effective processes are used to guide internal evaluation to build leadership capacity and to continue to improve teaching and learning capability. Leaders make good use of the individual strengths and passions of teachers to provide positive outcomes for tamariki and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on good practices, the next steps for leaders are to continue to strengthen the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focus on learning and the evaluation of teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal processes to better align with all of the requirements of the Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confidence of teachers in leading, implementing and monitoring effective internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aratupu Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aratupu Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>27 January 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
