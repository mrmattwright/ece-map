</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Kiwis Playhouse Learning Centre operates in a modified residential property. It provides good quality education and care for children between two and five years of age. Most children come from new immigrant families who live locally. Full day attendances are offered. Children can attend part time depending on family commitments.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy values children as capable and confident learners. Teachers are promoted as facilitators of children‚Äôs learning. Relationships between teachers and families are seen as foundations on which to build learning partnerships. The Treaty of Waitangi is valued as a unique opportunity for partnerships and is used as a base on which to foster multi-cultural relations.</p><p>The three teachers who work at the centre are qualified. Two of the teachers, including the manager/owner, hold full teacher registration. The third has just completed her training and is a provisionally registered teacher. The staff to child ratio is very high.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that positive teaching, learning and management practices had been established. ERO suggested that further work could be done to focus more on children‚Äôs individual ideas and interests and develop processes to extend children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Since the 2012 report the centre manager has engaged ongoing external advice and support and staff have participated in professional training to help them continue to raise the quality of teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display a good sense of belonging and are confident and articulate learners. They frequently engage in sustained conversations in their play with friends and are at ease with teachers. New children settle quickly and are supported to transition smoothly into the centre. Teachers use effective procedures to help this happen. Children with special learning needs are sensitively supported.</p><p>The importance of close home and centre relationships is central to the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Teachers arrange events and outings where whƒÅnau can get to know one another and the teachers better. WhƒÅnau friendships are formed. Teachers are aware of families‚Äô individual life circumstances and are keen to consider relevant ways to support them in order to sustain the children‚Äôs on-going learning.</p><p>Teaching and learning partnerships are growing between parents and teachers. WhƒÅnau surveys confirm that parents value the individual care and education that children receive. In return parents willingly share their expertise and knowledge about their children.</p><p>Children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds are valued. Home languages are spoken naturally by children. Some teachers are able to help children‚Äôs understanding of learning opportunities by translating conversations as required. Cultural celebrations are becoming regular events. Prized cultural items are appreciatively displayed and give children a heightened sense of belonging.</p><p>The owner is keen to learn new ways to operate the centre efficiently and at a high educational standard. She recognises that currently there are sustainability issues that challenge the operation of the centre and has thought about strategies to overcome them.</p><p>There have been recent changes to the leadership. When the head teacher left, the owner, in addition to managing the centre, has needed to take broader teaching responsibilities to enable the smooth running of the centre. She is managing this situation well and has maintained the quality of programmes for children.</p><p>The learning programme links strongly with the recommended practices in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Programme planning promotes children‚Äôs social, emotional, physical and cognitive growth. Children learn through individual exploration and also in group situations.</p><p>Group learning is a combination of teacher planned experiences such as cultural celebrations or outings and programmes based on children‚Äôs common interests. The learning environment is enriched to stimulate children‚Äôs interest. Teachers evaluate programmes regularly.</p><p>Individual development plans (IDPs) are designed to effectively promote children‚Äôs learning. Plans focus on goals based on interests observed in children‚Äôs play. Objectives and strategies are designed to support children‚Äôs spontaneous learning.</p><p>The new staff appraisal system encourages teachers‚Äô reflective practice and has recently been aligned to the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager plans to continue working with a professional development provider to strengthen outcomes for children. ERO and the manager agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>implementing and reviewing positive guidance strategies for managing children‚Äôs behaviour</li>
<li>further developing partnerships with whƒÅnau to support children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>developing a team understanding about mathematics and literacy learning in early childhood</li>
<li>evaluating children‚Äôs ongoing learning in portfolios to show progress over time</li>
<li>using self-review processes to guide strategic improvements</li>
<li>simplifying strategic plans to make goals more achievable.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Kiwis Playhouse Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Kiwis Playhouse Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
