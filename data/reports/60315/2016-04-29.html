</table><p>To improve service provision, stronger leadership, curriculum development, effective monitoring of teacher practice and consistent implementation of policies and procedures are required.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years 178 Rongotai operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood centres across New Zealand.</p><p>Full time and sessional care and education are provided. The centre is licensed for 30 children, with eight up to the age of two. Eight MƒÅori children are enrolled and seven children who identify as Pacific. The centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The November 2012 ERO report identified a number of areas for improvement. These included promoting children's ownership of their learning, extending children‚Äôs thinking, the bicultural programme, assessment, planning and evaluation, and self review. Insufficient progress has been made in these areas. Providing a suitable space for non-mobile infants and increasing parent involvement have been addressed.</p><p>This ERO review was part of a cluster of three in the BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy has recently been reviewed by the teaching team and reflects a collective vision for the centre. It is now timely for teachers to develop a shared understanding of high quality practice and use this understanding to develop indicators to inform curriculum design, implementation and review and evaluation. This will enable the service to ascertain how well they meet their vison.</p><p>Professional Service Managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance on the curriculum. They clearly identify strengths and areas for ongoing development. Some areas for improvement have been consistently identified over time. Increased support has been provided. However, the strategies implemented have not yet resulted in sufficient improvement.</p><p>Stronger leadership in curriculum design and implementation is a priority. Improved monitoring of teacher practice is required to ensure that high quality provision for children's early childhood education and care is consistently enacted.</p><p>The current practice of providing a range of planned activities around a theme provides a shared direction for the programme. The planning process requires improvement as it does not provide a sufficient level of complexity for children or clearly stated learning intentions to guide teachers practice. Once achieved this would assist with evaluating the outcomes for children's learning.</p><p>In the infant and toddler area, teachers are warm and responsive to children's cues. They work alongside children and use rich descriptive language to build their communication skills.</p><p>Children participate in a play-based programme. Those with additional learning needs are well supported. A focus on promoting healthy food and physical activity, and excursions into the local community extends the curriculum. Children play independently and alongside their peers. A stronger focus on promoting literacy and numeracy learning in the curriculum is required.</p><p>The quality of teaching and learning was identified as an area for development in ERO's previous review. This has not been sufficiently addressed. Leaders and teachers should provide children with opportunities to make choices in their play and learning, and take a more purposeful approach to engaging children in problem solving and active exploration.</p><p>Practices for positively guiding children's behaviour are not consistently implemented. Clear expectations are stated in the guiding policy. Revisiting this policy to develop a shared understanding of appropriate practice is a key next step. Leaders should then regularly monitor teachers practice.</p><p>Leaders and teachers recognise that the integration of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori into the curriculum is an urgent next step. ERO agrees, as insufficient progress has been made since the previous ERO review.</p><p>Leaders have identified that promoting educational success for MƒÅori children and for Pacific children are key next steps. Further developing leaders' and teachers' understanding of Ministry of Education publications will guide culturally responsive practice. These resources include <em>TatƒÅiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>, <em>Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017.</em></p><p>Regular profile entries provide useful information for parents and whƒÅnau about their child‚Äôs participation and interests. There is a strong focus on celebrating children's developmental milestones, and at times, their learning. Key next steps for teachers are to more consistently identify and plan for children's significant learning. Documentation should clearly reflect this and show children's learning progression over time. Leaders should monitor the quality of assessment documentation and provide targeted support for teachers to improve their practice.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have successfully implemented a range of strategies to further involve families in the programme.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment and has a development focus. Leaders have indicated that a next step is to include formal observations of all teacher practice to inform appraisal. The appraisal process should be consistently enacted for all staff and include clear documentation of feedback and next steps. BestStart provides opportunities for teachers to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>Internal evaluation is an area for development. Leaders and teachers should improve their understanding of review and evaluation processes.</p><p>Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified. A comprehensive policy framework including procedures and systems, is in place to guide the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clear indicators of quality teaching practice based on their vision and philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership in curriculum design, implementation, and improved monitoring of teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a curriculum that supports children to make choices, solve problems and promotes literacy and numeracy learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a consistent approach to enacting the positive guidance policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bicultural programme and an understanding of how educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children will be promoted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent enactment of the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years 178 Rongotai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>demonstrate an understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support children‚Äôs developing social competence and understanding of appropriate behaviour.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 43, C4, C10]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years 178 Rongotai will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>29 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
