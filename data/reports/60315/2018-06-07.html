</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years 178 Rongotai is situated in Wellington. It provides education and care for children from three months to five years of age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, 43 children were enrolled and six are MƒÅori and five are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>Since the April 2016 ERO review a new centre manager has been appointed. The centre has had a number of changes to the teaching team. Most teachers are fully qualified and they represent a diverse range of cultures. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager who supports the teaching team.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified a range of areas requiring further improvement. These included: improved curriculum leadership to develop quality assessment, planning and evaluation; a bicultural programme; promoting educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children; and developing internal evaluation processes. Very good progress has been made in addressing ERO's 2016 findings.</p><p>Early Years is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have opportunities to participate in an environment that promotes a sense of belonging. They experience warm and respectful relationships. Children‚Äôs leadership and engagement are promoted through positive interactions with their teachers and peers.</p><p>Teachers sensitively respond to and support infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô needs for strong and secure attachment. Effective strategies are used to promote these children‚Äôs literacy skills. Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers, parents, whƒÅnau and external agencies work in collaboration to support their full participation in the programme.</p><p>A review of the philosophy was recently undertaken to determine what the centre's key valued learning outcomes are for children. Indicators of good practice guide and support its effective implementation. Leaders acknowledge that a key next step is to work collaboratively with parents and whƒÅnau to deepen teachers' understanding of what educational success looks like for them and their children. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is actively promoted and evident in the centre. Children have opportunities to celebrate and share their whakapapa with their peers. Aspects of te reo MƒÅori are used in general conversations with children. Leaders should consider ways they can enrich the bicultural programme, by encouraging teachers to use te reo MƒÅori. The centre should also consider ways they can weave a place-based curriculum into the programme that celebrates local cultural places of significance to MƒÅori.</p><p>There has been a positive shift in teachers' practice that has resulted in a greater understanding of planning and assessment. A recently introduced framework for individualised planning is growing teachers' responses to individual children‚Äôs learning. Group planning is well established, and supports children‚Äôs emerging interests. Leaders and teachers should continue to strengthen the planning process by:</p><ul>
<li>developing intentional planning that recognises and extends the individual learning of each child</li>
<li>responding to children‚Äôs culture, language and identity and parent aspirations that informs planning for learning</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen progress towards children's learning goals.</li>
</ul><p>A sense of belonging for children, parents and whƒÅnau is nurtured during and after transitions into and within the centre and when they move onto school.</p><p>A sound appraisal system is in place to support and grow teachers' capability. The professional service manager provides regular feedback, support and guidance for teachers. The teaching team use inquiry to strengthen their teaching practice. BestStart provides regular professional learning and development opportunities for the centre.</p><p>An effective internal evaluation process has been implemented with clear expectations for its use. Leaders work collaboratively with the centre manager and teaching team to build their evaluative understanding. Teachers are becoming more confident to evaluate the impact of their practices on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leaders promote a shared understanding among teachers of the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre. There is a strong commitment to teaching and learning that contributes to improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a share understanding of what educational success looks like for MƒÅori children with their parents and whƒÅnau</li>
<li>encourage teachers to use te reo MƒÅori in their practice and the place-based curriculum significant to MƒÅori</li>
<li>enhance aspects of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years 178 Rongotai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years 178 Rongotai will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>7 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whƒÅnaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
