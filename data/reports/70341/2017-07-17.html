</table><p>Ara Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ara Early Learning Centre is located on the campus of Ara Institute of Canterbury (formerly CPIT). The Institute oversees the operation of the centre. A parent advisory committee also supports the centre.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for babies and children to school age in two separate rooms. The preschool and the nursery have their own outdoor areas.</p><p>The centre manager has been employed at the centre for a number of years. The head teachers in the nursery and the preschool were appointed since the 2014 ERO review. All teachers are qualified early childhood teachers and many have worked at the centre for a number of years.</p><p>The centre has made good progress to meet many of the recommendations in the previous ERO report. Parents are more involved in decision making, particularly developing the strategic plan and commenting on their children's learning. While progress has been made in internal evaluation and the use of te reo and tikanga Māori, they remain key next steps in this report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy's emphasis on relationships, environment, whānau and Māori values are well met in the programme by the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>nurturing and respectful relationships evident between children, teachers and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carefully considered environment that promotes sustainability, exploration, independence and engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>genuine acceptance of all families by valuing their culture, knowledge and aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integration of Māori values into relationships and the ways that children learn.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children are self-motivated learners who confidently use the environment to discover and develop their interests and extend their creativity and imaginative play. They make effective use of the well -presented and spacious learning areas to play independently and build positive and inclusive relationships with others. Literacy and mathematics is well integrated into all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Teachers skilfully extend children's learning by the ways they listen, ask questions and provide additional resources. They make effective use of children's interests to help them develop their investigative skills and increase their understanding of the world. Children are leaders of their learning and are developing useful research skills.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for by teachers who have a good knowledge of each child and their family. Routines are flexible to meet the needs of children and their families. The programme strongly focuses on children developing their sensory and communication skills. There is a reassuring emphasis on the familiar, with new resources and experiences introduced thoughtfully into the curriculum. Children are happy, settled and engaged.</p><p>The centre has many effective governance and management systems and practices. Leaders work collaboratively and make very good use of teacher strengths and interests to improve teaching and learning. The strategic plan is strongly focused on achieving the Institute's and the centre's vision and goals. The strategic goals are closely linked to professional development and staff appraisal. Regular reporting on progress to achieve the goals and evaluation of the impact of these developments is improving the quality of learning and teaching.</p><p>The centre's contributions to the success of the Ara Institute of Canterbury are highly valued. Institute managers visit regularly and acknowledge the significant role of the centre in providing for the wellbeing of children and families. Children and their learning are highly visible at all levels of the Institute. The centre leaders receive the support that they need from the Institute to provide high quality learning and teaching for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers, leaders and ERO agree that the effectiveness of governance and management systems and practices would be improved by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing internal evaluation processes to more effectively identify priorities for improvement, monitoring implementation of improvement actions and evaluating their impact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying expectations and refining processes to improve the usefulness of assessment to effectively identify learning and teaching outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying bicultural understanding and practices already in place and making them more visible in the environment and documents. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ara Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ara Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>17 July 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
