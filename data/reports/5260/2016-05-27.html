</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Milson Kindergarten is one of 25 early childhood services administered by the Ruahine Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). It is licensed for 40 children aged over two years. Of the 52 children enrolled, 14 are MƒÅori. All five teachers are qualified and certificated.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy's core foundation is to promote trusting, respectful relationships between children, whƒÅnau and teachers.</p><p>The October 2012 ERO report identified that use of self review to enhance programmes for children, and further building bicultural understanding needed further development. Professional support has been provided to improve these aspects of practice. Good progress is evident.</p><p>Day-to-day management of the association's affairs is the responsibility of the general manager. A governing board sets the overall strategic direction. The senior teacher provides professional leadership for teaching and learning. An operations manager supports kindergartens' compliance, policy development and leadership. A management restructure has been undertaken since the previous ERO review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Ruahine Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a child-initiated, play-based curriculum for the majority of time and are busy, purposeful, active learners. Teachers encourage emerging interests, and support child-led inquiries and investigations. Children‚Äôs risk-taking within a safe environment is well supported. They make choices from the wide range of rich learning experiences.</p><p>Children are developing skills that support them as capable, confident, lifelong learners. Early literacy and numeracy experiences are included meaningfully throughout the programme.</p><p>Teachers focus on developing positive relationships between homes and the kindergarten. Children with special needs are welcomed and supported by close partnerships with parents. Teachers know each child and their personalities well.</p><p>Children's learning and development are celebrated and shared between teachers and parents. An on-line programme supports improved parent communication about children's plans, progress and achievements. Teachers continue to refine and embed systems to better record how they recognise and respond to individual learning. This development should include giving further consideration of the purpose and intent of children's portfolios.</p><p>Children have a variety of opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. Teachers are enthusiastic about exploring further ways of enhancing culturally responsive practices for MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Transitions to school are managed with care. Strong connections are formed with the adjacent school. Teachers and parents increasingly share information so that children‚Äôs confidence and capability at preschool transfer to the new entrant classroom. Teachers should continue to seek ways to further strengthen this relationships with other contributing schools.</p><p>The experienced head teacher confidently leads staff. They have ample opportunities for leadership to support their professional growth. Teachers continue to develop evidence-based internal evaluation processes and practices, to improve on the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The kindergarten's annual plan outlines priorities for the year linked to the association's strategic goals of having high quality staff, coordinated services, effective partnerships and operations. Progress is recorded and reflected upon in collaboration with the senior teacher and operations manager. Quality indicators linked to outcomes for children are a useful addition to the annual plan. These should be further defined to enable more effective monitoring of progress.</p><p>Progress has been made in developing a bicultural perspective in the programme. This is supported by an environmental focus, bicultural values, teacher development goals and professional learning opportunities. Association leaders are strongly committed to implementing a bicultural curriculum and promoting success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori. The revised Te Tiriti o Waitangi policy, Wise Practice document and bicultural exemplars should support development of these practices.</p><p>The association provides effective governance and management support for this service. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>constructive and improvement-focused support from the senior teacher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable quality assurance processes and guidelines linked to compliance with regulations and association expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective and targeted support for teacher and leadership development through appraisal and wide-ranging professional learning opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a variety of operational and administrative support.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association agrees the continued development of the Wise Practice indicators should occur to support understanding about the quality and effectiveness of practice and operation at kindergarten through to board level.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and association leaders agree that teachers should be supported to continue to strengthen understanding and use of internal evaluation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Milson Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Milson Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em>¬†</p><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3 style="font-size: 10px;">ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>¬†timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
