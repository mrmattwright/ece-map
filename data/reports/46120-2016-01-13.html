</table><p>Moreporks Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Moreporks Preschool is part of the Evolve Education Group. The privately-owned company purchased the centre in December 2014. Evolve provides the policy and administration framework. The centre is well supported by the new owners with an area manager who regularly provides professional support and guidance to the centre manager and staff.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children to school age in four separate rooms. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers. The centre is purpose built and has been open since March 2013. This is the centre‚Äôs first Education Review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy gives strong emphasis to building respectful relationships with children, parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers integrate bicultural practices in meaningful ways into learning programmes.</p><p>Children experience positive relationships with each other, their teachers and support staff. These respectful relationships support their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Children are settled and confidently make choices about their play. They have many opportunities to use a wide range of natural resources that encourage their curiosity and exploration.</p><p>Teachers listen carefully to children and take time to extend their ideas and thinking. They plan the learning programmes from children‚Äôs interests. There is an appropriate focus on literacy and numeracy throughout the centre. Teachers provide a good range of meaningful experiences to promote children‚Äôs independence and imaginative play. Visitors to the centre and excursions into the community enrich children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have a high level of commitment to ensuring te ao MƒÅori and bicultural practices are evident across the teaching teams. Teachers naturally integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into learning programmes.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are supported by responsive adults who know them well. They promote calm, unhurried interactions and routines. Teachers and parents regularly share information to foster children‚Äôs sense of security and wellbeing. Home routines are closely followed at the centre.</p><p>Parents are kept informed about their children‚Äôs learning through well-written learning stories and informative wall displays. Individual child assessment and programme planning reflect the child‚Äôs language and culture and show progress of learning over time. Parent aspirations and contributions are valued and used effectively in planning for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are carefully planned to meet the needs of each child and family. The recent review of transition to school processes has resulted in the development of useful information for parents and stronger relationships with local schools.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. The centre manager, head teacher and area manager work collaboratively. They have a strong commitment to the ongoing improvement of learning and teaching, and to promoting positive outcomes for children. Leaders make good use of professional development to increase teachers‚Äô knowledge and skills.</p><p>Leaders and teachers use a systematic, collaborative process for self review. This provides teachers with frequent opportunities to think deeply about their practice. Effective self review results in positive outcomes for children and worthwhile changes in centre practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified and ERO agrees that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine and consolidate new initiatives</li>
<li>evaluate the impact of teaching strategies on outcomes for children and group planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Moreporks Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>13 January 2016</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
