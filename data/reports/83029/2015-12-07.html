</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Clair Kindergarten has recently come under the umbrella of the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). It had previously been a small, stand-alone community kindergarten with 100 years of history. The community initiated and has strongly supported the move.</p><p>The kindergarten operates a six-hour session and now caters for 30 children in the morning and 20 in the afternoon. The teaching team has mainly stayed the same since 2009. The head teacher is new to the role but was already part of the existing teaching team.</p><p>The kindergarten is temporarily housed in a hall on the DK site after the June 2015 floods in the South Dunedin area. The DK is exploring options for building a new facility in consultation with the kindergarten community. </p><p>Teachers aim to develop a culture that fosters the principles of tuakana/teina, mahi tahi, aroha and awhina. They aim to work in partnership with families and the community to provide a curriculum that responds to children’s knowledge, skills and interests. ERO found this to be evident in the interactions and daily programme.</p><p>This review of St Clair Kindergarten was one of 24 kindergartens under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have adapted very well to the changes, including moving into a temporary building and extensive changes to the outside area, brought about by the South Dunedin floods.</p><p>Children:</p><ul>
<li>play confidently in the indoor and outdoor areas</li>
<li>are settled and engaged in their learning</li>
<li>have fun alongside their teachers and friends</li>
<li>are secure in the routines and expectations within the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have created a strongly inclusive, welcoming environment for children and their families. Children with particular needs are well supported to participate fully in the programme alongside their peers. Skilled teacher aides work with them and adaptations are made within the programme such as the use of sign language so all children can be included.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-planned and interesting curriculum. Teachers have set up the environment so that it encourages children to explore, be creative, ask questions, make choices and build on their learning. They provide resources to enrich and extend learning, including children’s passions and interests. Teachers seek children’s ideas about their learning. Children experience:</p><ul>
<li>purposeful outings into the community</li>
<li>early literacy and oral language</li>
<li>creative and expressive play</li>
<li>physical challenges and exploration</li>
<li>real-life experiences as a starting point for learning, such as children following a teacher’s trip to Africa.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers demonstrate their commitment to a programme that reflects the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Children hear and use te reo Māori, observe tikanga practices such as karakia, enjoy waiata, celebrate Matariki and learn about te ao Māori.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to share their strengths and interests to enrich the learning programme.</p><p>Children and their families are well supported as they settle into the kindergarten and in the transition to school process. Parents share information about their children, and teachers consult with parents about important matters concerning the direction of the kindergarten.</p><p>There is a useful system for planning for individuals. Children’s profile books show the wide range of experiences children have at the kindergarten. Teachers have frequent informal discussions with families about their child’s learning. Teachers should now find ways to show more consistently in the written records how they use these discussions to decide the next steps for learning and what they will do to support this. </p><p>Records of group planning would be strengthened by teachers stating more clearly the intended learning. Currently evaluations describe what has happened. These need to be evaluative and show how well the intended learning is met through the strategies and experiences provided.</p><p>The long-serving and experienced team work well together. They have a strong commitment to teaching and learning. They appreciate the support given to them through the process of becoming part of the DK.</p><p>Teachers are using a purposeful format for self review provided by the DK. They are developing their understanding of effective self review. This continues to be work in progress.</p><p>The teachers and parents, with the support of the DK, have managed the time of significant changes well.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to the identified needs of children and families within the association, and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, senior teacher and ERO agree that the next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop the philosophy to make clear what is valued as important learning for children</li>
<li>show more consistently the way that teachers and parents work together to agree on learning priorities for their child and how the teachers respond</li>
<li>strengthen group-planning records to show the intended learning</li>
<li>extend evaluations to show how the strategies and experiences have supported children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to further develop their understanding and use of self review. This includes developing:</p><ul>
<li>a clearly identified focus and an evaluative question to guide each review</li>
<li>indicators of best practice relevant to the review</li>
<li>links to and use of indicators to evaluate current practice and any changes made as a result of the review. </li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association’s vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher, it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistently high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Clair Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Clair Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>7 December 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 621px;">

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
