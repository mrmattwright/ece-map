<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2 provides home-based education and care for up to 60 children from birth to school age in Hamilton. There are currently 54 children on the roll. It is one of four networks governed by The Hamilton Services Trust. The director continues to provide strong and effective leadership with the support of a knowledgeable and experienced management team.</p><p>Educator and coordinator interactions with children are respectful and caring and interactions with babies are gentle and affectionate. Educators encourage children to be independent and provide effective support for the development of children&rsquo;s social, communication and learning skills. The coordinator gets to know children well through her visits to educators&rsquo; homes and interactions at other meeting places.</p><p>Children benefit from a wide variety of learning experiences in home and community settings. A feature is the regular attendance of children at playgroup and gymnastics sessions. These sessions provide a sound foundation for children&rsquo;s future learning by providing opportunities for them to express their creativity, explore mathematical, scientific and literacy concepts and extend their physical abilities.</p><p>Parents appreciate the two-way communication they have with educators about their children, verbally and in writing. They also value their children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios and the additional information that the coordinator provides about the quality of their children&rsquo;s education and care.</p><p>The coordinator has developed effective ways of increasing educators&rsquo; understanding of good practices in early childhood education, and their use of relevant resources. She works with educators to plan interesting and varied learning programmes, and to keep records of children&rsquo;s development and progress. The coordinator also supports educators to document how they identify and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and learning. Increasing educators&rsquo; confidence to use M&#257;ori language with children would be appropriate.</p><p>The management team makes good use of self review to identify priorities for further review and development. Communication with educators and parents has been identified as one area of focus. The team of coordinators has written an annual action plan to guide the implementation of this and other service long-term goals. This team should consider placing more emphasis on recording their effectiveness in implementing these goals.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 Review Priorities</span></h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atHamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>The managers also suggested, and ERO agreed to consider the quality of communication between managers, coordinators, educators and families.</p><p>Findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2 is a quality-funded network that provides education and care for children and families in Hamilton. Educators care for up to four children at a time in their own homes, and are supported by a coordinator who is a registered early childhood teacher. Reviewers visited four of the 18 educators in this network, as well as the service&rsquo;s gym and playgroup. They observed interactions among children, educators and coordinators and evaluated the quality of learning environments, programmes and planning and assessment documentation.</p><p>This network receives quality funding from the Ministry of Education as its educators have completed Module One of the Certificate in Family Daycare or higher qualifications in early childhood education.</p><p>Coordinators for Hamilton Homebased Care Networks work closely as a team. Reports for the four networks are written to reflect minor differences that acknowledge any particular features identified during the reviews.</p><p>The service responded positively to the areas for improvement and recommendations from the previous ERO report.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p><strong>Interactions and relationships:</strong> Educators have caring, respectful and nurturing relationships with children. They use positive guidance to help children behave responsibly and show empathy for others. Educators&rsquo; interactions with children encourage them to listen, respond and engage in conversations, increasing their understanding of language and their ability to communicate effectively.</p><p>Through networking, and their attendance at the gym morning and playgroup centre, educators form strong, supportive relationships with each other. Many educators interact with children who are another&rsquo;s responsibility, to enrich their learning and care. Children have extensive opportunities to relate to friends of different ages and to develop good social skills.</p><p>Parents appreciate the regular conversations they have with educators about their children&rsquo;s well-being, daily experiences and achievements. The coordinator keeps in contact with parents to provide additional information about the quality of their children&rsquo;s education and care.</p><p><strong>Environment and resources:</strong> Children benefit from the supportive, family-like environments evident in the homes visited during this ERO review. They enjoy exploring different indoor and outdoor spaces at their own and other educators&rsquo; homes. Trips to local places of interest or excursions to more distant attractions increase their knowledge of the wider community.</p><p>Educators offer children interesting activities, and often enrich their programmes by using high-quality play equipment and resource kits from the service&rsquo;s extensive pool of items for loan. Another feature of the network is the regular attendance of educators and children at an attractive and well-resourced playgroup centre. This permanently set up centre operates four mornings a week. Its learning areas are thoughtfully planned to extend children&rsquo;s opportunities for exploration, challenge and making friends. New educators benefit from observing models of sound educational practices provided by the coordinator and more experienced educators.</p><p><strong>Programme:</strong> As expected by the trust, all educators keep records of children&rsquo;s experiences in home-based care. Individual portfolios are well presented and contain photographs and descriptions of children&rsquo;s participation in activities. The quality of planning for individual children has improved with the introduction of a new format for educators to record how they &lsquo;notice, recognise and respond&rsquo; to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Educators and coordinators foster learning about literacy and early mathematical concepts through their conversations with children and provision of home and playgroup experiences. Children learn about measuring, counting and shapes and enjoy sharing books and experimenting with drawing and writing. A challenging programme at the weekly gym is developing children&rsquo;s physical strength, balance and coordination, providing a strong foundation for their ongoing learning.</p><p><strong>Leadership:</strong> The director provides strong and effective professional leadership and enjoys the support of a knowledgeable and experienced management team. She clearly identifies priorities to maintain and improve the quality of the network services, and delegates and monitors implementation of tasks to achieve priorities set.</p><p>The team of coordinators is well supported and receives appropriate professional development. The team leader works closely with her colleagues to support their professional development and learning, and to manage the operations of the networks. The team has a strong focus on communication with parents, children and educators. An important part of their responsibility is to visit educators and keep parents informed about their children&rsquo;s well-being, development and learning.</p><p>As a qualified teacher, the coordinator in this network shares with educators her in-depth knowledge of good practice for teaching and learning in early childhood education, and her extensive experience of what works in home-based care. She uses a variety of effective strategies to support educators to notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning, and to keep records showing children&rsquo;s development and progress.</p><p>This is contributing to the network&rsquo;s ability to provide high quality services for parents and children.</p><h4>Agreed priorities for development and review</h4><p><strong>Self review:</strong> The director has made effective use of self-review processes to identify areas for further development of the services&rsquo; home-based childcare networks. As a result, a detailed annual plan has been developed to address priority tasks. To further improve the quality of home-based education and care, coordinators need to undertake robust self reviews that involve:</p><ul>
<li>clear expression of expectations, and indicators of good practice;</li>
<li>the analysis of information gathered to identify areas of strength and what needs to improve;</li>
<li>the development and implementation of an action plan for improvement;</li>
<li>the evaluation of outcomes that affect the quality of children&rsquo;s education and care; and</li>
<li>a record of each stage of the process.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Communication with educators and parents:</strong> As part of the internal review of home-based childcare networks, the trust has identified a need to review and improve aspects of the service&rsquo;s communication with parents and educators. The trust considers, and ERO agrees, that there would be benefit in coordinators:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop educators&rsquo; confidence in documenting how they notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning and interests;</li>
<li>increasing parent input into planning for their children&rsquo;s learning; and</li>
<li>developing agreed goals for individual educators, and collating these to identify network and service priorities for support and development.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports.&nbsp; This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.&nbsp;</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>In accordance with its philosophy, Hamilton Homebased Childcare accepts all children who can be accommodated in its services, including those with special needs. Three networks operate in Hamilton, and one in Cambridge and Hamilton. These networks provide a wide range of options for children to be placed in appropriate environments. Management has a policy of approaching specialist services, with the permission of parents, to seek and offer help and maintain communication about each child&rsquo;s well-being.</p><h4>Findings</h4><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this network, managers would welcome any such children and their families. The service is very inclusive of children with special needs, their families and educators.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2 completed an ERO <em>Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-hamilton-homebased-childcare-network-2" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>To the Parents and Community of Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2</span></h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2.</p><p>Hamilton Homebased Childcare Network 2 provides home-based education and care for up to 60 children from birth to school age in Hamilton. There are currently 54 children on the roll. It is one of four networks governed by The Hamilton Services Trust. The director continues to provide strong and effective leadership with the support of a knowledgeable and experienced management team.</p><p>Educator and coordinator interactions with children are respectful and caring and interactions with babies are gentle and affectionate. Educators encourage children to be independent and provide effective support for the development of children&rsquo;s social, communication and learning skills. The coordinator gets to know children well through her visits to educators&rsquo; homes and interactions at other meeting places.</p><p>Children benefit from a wide variety of learning experiences in home and community settings. A feature is the regular attendance of children at playgroup and gymnastics sessions. These sessions provide a sound foundation for children&rsquo;s future learning by providing opportunities for them to express their creativity, explore mathematical, scientific and literacy concepts and extend their physical abilities.</p><p>Parents appreciate the two-way communication they have with educators about their children, verbally and in writing. They also value their children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios and the additional information that the coordinator provides about the quality of their children&rsquo;s education and care.</p><p>The coordinator has developed effective ways of increasing educators&rsquo; understanding of good practices in early childhood education, and their use of relevant resources. She works with educators to plan interesting and varied learning programmes, and to keep records of children&rsquo;s development and progress. The coordinator also supports educators to document how they identify and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and learning. Increasing educators&rsquo; confidence to use M&#257;ori language with children would be appropriate.</p><p>The management team makes good use of self review to identify priorities for further review and development. Communication with educators and parents has been identified as one area of focus. The team of coordinators has written an annual action plan to guide the implementation of this and other service long-term goals. This team should consider placing more emphasis on recording their effectiveness in implementing these goals.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
