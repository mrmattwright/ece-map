</table><p><span>Active Explorers Highbrook¬†<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers Highbrook provides for 150 children, including up to 75 aged under two years. Children are cared for in nine separate learning areas, grouped according to their age. Two adjoining rooms and shared outdoor spaces enable infants, toddlers and young children to play together. Children are from diverse cultural backgrounds, with the largest group being Chinese. Eight percent of children enrolled are MƒÅori and 12 percent have Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre was previously known as Lollipops Educare Highbrook. Since the 2015 ERO review, the centre has become part of the Evolve Education Group (EEG). Visiting personnel from EEG support the centre in its day-to-day operations, long-term planning and development projects. The centre manager, assistant manager and team leaders work together and alongside EEG.</p><p>The centre's philosophy recognises diversity and the uniqueness of each child. It expresses a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Children are viewed as being carers of and for the environment where respect and responsibility are fostered. Social competencies and self-regulation are key features of the philosophy. Kai times are shared experiences and for older children, this takes place in the whare kai.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted a variety of positive practices. Next steps identified in the 2015 report included deepening teachers' self-inquiry, increasing children's learning in mathematics and reviewing the philosophy. There has been significant improvement in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are welcomed and well known by centre staff. Interactions and relationships between children, their peers and teachers are positive. Teachers affirm children's languages and cultures and value diversity. Some teachers speak children's home languages, which supports oral language development.</p><p>Children have access to abundant resources and flexible materials. Environments offer opportunities for investigation and support curiosity, active exploration and imaginative play.</p><p>Children are engaged in meaningful learning experiences that are often sustained for prolonged periods. Collaborative play helps to extend their thinking, foster independence and enhance social competence. Teachers encourage children to initiate purposeful problem-solving activities. Children learn to strategise and reason with each other, deepening their understanding and acceptance of differing perspectives.</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for children to engage in complex play to broaden learning dispositions. They skilfully integrate mathematics, literacy and science into children's play. A holistic curriculum supports children's wellbeing.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive quality care and benefit from high adult-to-child ratios. They are familiar with centre routines and are independent learners. Their learning environments are relaxed and calm. Teachers read the cues of children well and understand their ways of communicating. They respect children's preferences and support them to deal with conflict and frustrations.</p><p>Teachers are deliberate in noticing what is important and valued learning for children. They are responsive to children's interests, strengths and abilities. Individual development plans (IDP) have strengthened teachers' understanding and knowledge of children as learners.</p><p>Documentation of children's learning demonstrates a high level of teacher engagement. Children's ideas, thinking and child-led learning are carefully considered and made visible through individual and group learning stories. Teachers use a range of observational techniques to gather information about children's learning to inform decisions and extend their planning. Their assessment and planning are linked with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers' positive relationships with parents/whƒÅnau contribute to mutual respect and a shared understanding of parents' aspirations and expectations for children. Transitions from room to room are managed well. Children from both preschool rooms have been part of a newly designed readiness for school programme. It would be useful to document this and evaluate how successful it has been for children.</p><p>EEG provides a framework of policies and procedures to guide centre practices. EEG has established an effective process for centres to implement internal evaluation. The centre manager and assistant manager support a shared understanding about internal evaluation among all staff. This is contributing to the ongoing improvements of the service. Strategic and annual plans are aligned to the overarching vision of EEG.</p><p>The appraisal process is robust. Constructive feedback to team leaders for each room has supported teachers' professional knowledge and practice, with explicit goals and expectations. This has been particularly significant in shifts towards better understandings of teachers' inquiry-based learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO have identified next steps for sustaining and building on current very good practices. These areas include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen curriculum evaluation, making explicit links to theory, current research and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support new leaders in their role to ensure the maintenance of high-quality education and care in all learning spaces.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group senior managers agree that their key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company's vision and values, goals and principles reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addressing staffing issues in some centres to ensure quality teaching practices are evident, promoting positive outcomes for all children and ensuring sustainability of quality practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively the levels and quality of learning resources in centres promote collaboration amongst children and promote more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional learning and development for leaders and teachers to ensure a deeper engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers Highbrook completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, Evolve Education Group senior managers must take steps to ensure that health and safety policies and procedures are implemented rigorously across all services.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> <i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
