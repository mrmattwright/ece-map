</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the only full-day early learning centre in Clinton. It is a small centre and caters for infants to school-age children. This is its second ERO review since opening.</p><p>The centre has a new manager/owner who also works with the children. She is training to be an early childhood educator. There have been recent changes in the teaching team. The staff is made up of in-training, recently graduated and experienced teachers and part-time helpers.</p><p>Toddlers and infants have a special room with age appropriate resources. However, they often learn alongside the older children. This means that they are familiar with all staff and children and this eases their later transition into the over-two year old room. Each room has a lead teacher.</p><p>Since the last review, centre leaders and teachers have improved the outdoor environment. This spacious area now offers good opportunities for physical challenge, exploration and imaginative play.  Recently the centre won a Gold Healthy Heart award.</p><p>The past manager/owner and teaching team worked hard to address the recommendations in ERO’s 2013 report. Many of these improvements have been maintained. Some areas need further work and are referred to later in this report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's priorities for children's learning are clearly stated in the centre's philosophy. These include: social competence, developing confidence, having choice, taking responsibility and growing leadership skills. These priorities are very evident in teachers' planning for individuals and groups, and in children's learning stories. They are prominently displayed for parents and staff.</p><p>ERO observed respectful interactions between adults and children. Adults give children time to express their thoughts and attempt tasks independently. Older children are encouraged to be gentle with and help younger children (i.e. tuakana-teina relationships).</p><p>There is a calm and settled feeling to the centre. Most children play well with and alongside each other. Many show a sustained interest in their play and/or learning activities. Children know and follow the centre's well-established routines.</p><p>Teachers carefully support children to manage their social interactions. They do this through encouraging children to use their voice, listen to each other's views and reflect on positive ways to resolve conflict. </p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of interesting learning experiences. These are often based on children's interests and ideas. Teachers deliberately find relevant resources and activities to further children's curiosity and learning. In particular, children enjoy a variety of science, mathematics and art experiences.</p><p>Children benefit from well-planned transitions into and through the centre. Transition to school has been a special focus, with regular visits to and from local schools. An assigned teacher plans a special four-year old programme. This includes interesting inquiries into areas of interest for children. She also provides helpful information to parents.</p><p>Each term, teachers develop learning plans for each child. These are based on children's interests and needs, and link back to the centre's philosophy. Plans include learning goals and strategies to achieve these. Each term, children's progress is evaluated and new goals set.</p><p>In children's profiles there are regular stories about group and individual learning. Many individual learning stories are very good quality. The best stories linked back to a child's learning goal, noted significant learning and how teachers had or will support this. Teachers need to ensure all learning stories reflect best practices described above. The centre needs a system that enables all staff to know each child's goals and the strategies to support these.</p><p>Infant and toddlers have an assigned teacher but all teachers and children interact with them. When ERO was at the centre, infants and toddlers appeared happy and settled. Teachers write for parents a daily record about their child's care, wellbeing, activities and learning.</p><p>Teachers regularly evaluate and reflect on how they could better support children in their learning. This was evident in meeting minutes, planned and emergent reviews of centre practices and in teacher's individual folders.</p><p>Over the last year, teachers have reviewed how well they value and include Māori perspectives, language and learning in the centre. They show a commitment to continuing to strengthen these areas. A next step is to consult with Māori parents as to how the centre can best support their child, as Māori.</p><p>The previous owner had developed a useful long-term (strategic) and annual plan to guide centre development and improvement. These plans need to be reviewed each year to reflect current priorities. This will help the manager/owner, leaders and teachers keep agreed priorities to the fore and work together to achieve these. </p><p>The new manager/owner shows a genuine desire to provide the best for children. She has purposefully sought an experienced early childhood manager to act as her mentor. They talk and meet regularly to discuss best practice and other matters. ERO encourages the manager to maintain this relationship and seek other guidance when necessary.</p><p>The centre has policies, procedures and management guidelines that outline what should happen in the centre. Most policies and procedures have been reviewed over time. However, work is needed to remove duplication and to update some to reflect current requirements and/or best practice (e.g. assessment and planning procedures).</p><p>The procedures and practices related to appraisal of teachers and their endorsement for registration do not meet the requirements of the Education Council.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for this centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>review and update the centre's strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>regularly review progress against the annual and other action plans (e.g. next steps from any self review)</li>
<li>maintain and build on the effective assessment, planning and evaluation and self-review practices</li>
<li>improve appraisal procedures and practices</li>
<li>carry out regular and anonymous surveys of parents and staff</li>
<li>better document and respond to parents' wishes for their child's learning</li>
<li>consider extending self-review areas to include how well the centre supports children's oral language and other early literacy skills. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Clinton Little Oaks Learning Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>While on site, ERO discussed two safety issues that needed addressing. These related to objects that might fall on children and the need to ensure that children were in view of teachers at all times.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Clinton Little Oaks Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>26 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
