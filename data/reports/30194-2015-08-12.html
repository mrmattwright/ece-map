</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whakamarama &amp; Districts Kindergarten is located in the rural area of Whakamarama, north of Bethlehem, near Tauranga. It is licensed for 30 children over two years of age. Currently 34 children are attending, including six who are identified as MƒÅori. It provides an all-day programme from 8.30am to 2.45pm, five days a week.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, two new teachers have been appointed. The kindergarten is supported by a committee of active parents and enjoys the support of the wider parent and farming community. Leaders and teachers have recently begun to consult with parents to review the kindergarten philosophy. Their shared belief in care, kindness and respect for one another are values that underpin this unique place for children. The kindergarten expects to provide a safe, nurturing, fun and stimulating environment where children care for each other and the world around them.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK). This early childhood education service is governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a Resource Teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens placing emphasis on:</p><ul>
<li>nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities</li>
<li>educating for sustainability</li>
<li>meeting community needs</li>
<li>honouring the Treaty of Waitangi.</li>
</ul><p>The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There is a good range of self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of education and care provided by its kindergartens.</p><p>Consistent with TRK policy of only employing trained and registered teachers in regulated positions, the kindergarten is staffed by three qualified and registered teachers along with an administrator.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergarten reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children develop high levels of in-depth, trusting relationships with teachers and each other. They approach teachers with affection and share their ideas and interests. The environment is well-prepared to provide a rich variety of experiences. Children enjoy playing and exploring in the outdoor area, joining in imaginative play and showing creativity in arts and music. Oral language, literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated in the programme.</p><p>A strong feature of the curriculum is the teachers‚Äô commitment to visiting and investigating the native bush areas close to the kindergarten. Children experience a sense of wellbeing as they discover the world of nature and develop responsible attitudes as guardians of the native bush. They also learn to recycle their rubbish and use other natural resources such as water in a sustainable way.</p><p>MƒÅori concepts and values are expressed in kindergarten practices. Visitors and new families are welcomed with a whakatau, led by older children who are recognised as rangatira. Children are learning about MƒÅori legends, sing waiata and learn to use poi. MƒÅori parents feel valued and contribute their skills and knowledge to further children‚Äôs understanding of the MƒÅori world. This also recognises MƒÅori children‚Äôs culture and identity.</p><p>Children are able to make choices and to follow their interests. Teachers spend time with children, supporting their engagement in self-initiated and sustained play. They ask open-ended questions to prompt children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving. Teachers place importance on children‚Äôs sense of self esteem and wellbeing. They make good use of specific feedback to recognise positive social behaviour and contribution to the life of the kindergarten. Teachers are skilled in supporting children with additional learning needs. Together with parents and external agencies, they work to identify areas for development and share useful skills and approaches to respond to their specific needs.</p><p>Teacher planning includes ideas from children‚Äôs interests as well as a balance of teacher-initiated interests such as autumn, butterflies and Matariki. Parents and children enjoy reading and sharing their individual profile pukapuka, which describe children‚Äôs activities and involvement in the programme. Some parents contribute to the pukapuka and many share information about children‚Äôs learning and interests. These ideas are then followed up in the daily programme. Parents appreciate the richness of the programme and the welcoming, family-like environment.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive and supportive relationship with the adjacent school. Teachers assist parents to plan children‚Äôs transition to this school and to others in the wider community.</p><p>The head teacher leads a team that shares a commitment to values about children‚Äôs care and wellbeing, and care and respect for the environment. These values underpin their teaching. The team is working together to develop robust processes for effective communication and professional sharing. Leadership roles are shared amongst the team.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in professional development and learning that has increased their confidence in supporting children‚Äôs interests and establishing positive relationships. The proposed review of the centre‚Äôs philosophy is likely to result in a more purposeful programme for environmental sustainability. The kindergarten is well supported in its operation and development by the association‚Äôs senior teacher, who has a strong collegial relationship with the team. The head teacher and team have created a culture where children are, first and foremost, highly valued and celebrated for who they are.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that teachers need to review assessment processes to more clearly identify changes in children‚Äôs learning. Strengthening systems for assessment will enable teachers to provide an environment that more specifically challenges and supports individual children‚Äôs ongoing growth.</p><p>Teachers need to enhance the ways they ensure that children benefit from a partnership between home and kindergarten. This will include:</p><ul>
<li>interpreting the curriculum for parents</li>
<li>assisting parents to support desired learning outcomes at home.</li>
</ul><p>Self-review systems need to be strengthened to follow an agreed process and maintain systematic documentation of the evaluation, the resulting decisions and the outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leaders agree that establishing a closer relationship with the local iwi would assist the kindergarten to acknowledge the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand, and increase children‚Äôs local knowledge and sense of identity.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whakamarama &amp; Districts Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whakamarama &amp; Districts Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
