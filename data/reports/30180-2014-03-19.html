</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parent and Child is a privately owned education and care service in Havelock North. It is licensed for 54 children, including up to 38 aged under two years. It operates in the mornings.</p><p>Previously, the centre operated under a separate licence for each age group. Merging the licences in 2012 has brought greater flexibility in staffing and programme planning. The current roll of 191 children includes 11 who are MƒÅori.</p><p>A key feature of the centre is that it is family based. Parents and whƒÅnau members attend with the children. The guiding philosophy is based on the belief that the relationship between parents and children is the foundation for learning. Teachers at the centre support children‚Äôs development by providing a stimulating and secure environment in which parents and children are valued and respected.</p><p>The centre continues to use the specialised indoor-outdoor area set up for infants and toddlers. Parents move freely with their children between different areas, according to need and readiness. Many families bring more than one child.</p><p>The director is the licensee. She works in close partnership with managers and teachers, who are responsible for day-to-day operations and programmes. All teachers are qualified and registered.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is highly evident in practice. Managers, teachers, parents and whƒÅnau have a shared understanding of the values that underpin teaching and learning.</p><p>Programmes, relationships and the environment effectively support and stimulate learning and development. The wellbeing of children, their parents and whƒÅnau is at the heart of decision-making and planning. Teachers work closely with families to cater for children with special education needs.</p><p>Parents appreciate and value the flexible, responsive approach of centre staff. For them, the centre is a place where they are known, respected and trusted, and where they enjoy genuine partnership with teachers. Family members receive warm hospitality and support. Transitions into, within and out of the centre are managed with sensitivity and care.</p><p>Learning environments, indoor and outdoor, are of high quality. Furniture, equipment and play materials are laid out with careful consideration of space, mobility and safety. A broad range of learning resources enable children to explore, create and experiment freely. Teachers and parents monitor children‚Äôs interests and strengths. They provide opportunities to extend children's learning and challenge their thinking and physical skills. Programmes are child-led.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The leadership team is highly collegial and child-focused. Sound structures, policies and procedures support smooth operations and ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and leaders recognise that they need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>support teachers to raise the profile of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>refine and develop self review</li>
<li>strengthen appraisal processes by ensuring that teachers‚Äô goals are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-framed) and aligned with the centre‚Äôs strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><p>ERO‚Äôs evaluation found that overall, teachers have good informal knowledge of children‚Äôs learning and development. More systematic documentation and recording of individual children‚Äôs dispositions and progress should further increase the effectiveness of teachers‚Äô and parents‚Äô responses to what they observe and notice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parent and Child completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Parent and Child will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
