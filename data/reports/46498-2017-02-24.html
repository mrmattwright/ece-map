</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blossoms Educare Riverside is a new privately owned centre located beside the Tamaki River and close to Otahuhu. The service provides full day education and care for up to 64 children including up to 15 under two years old. There are separate indoor areas and adjoining outdoor spaces for each age group. Most children on the roll are of Māori, Indian or Pacific heritage and they are supported by a culturally diverse teaching team. This is the first review of the centre.</p><p>The centre is one of eight in the South Auckland area operated by the owner. The service focuses on increasing participation in early childhood education by providing an affordable service. Children of families in need are fully subsidised to attend the centre. Staff are well supported by the organisation's support team that visits frequently to foster the quality of teaching and learning, help with resource development and monitor centre operations. This team is building the capability of staff to operate the centre more independently with specific procedures aligned to the organisation's policies and goals.</p><p>The owner, two support team leaders and seven staff members are registered teachers. Centre staff have an external appraiser and mentor who supports their ongoing development and monitors their achievement of goals. Teachers also participate in professional development focused on strengthening bicultural practice and enhancing the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>Centre practices are underpinned by the Blossoms philosophy of providing uninterrupted play, enabling children to self-regulate and build reciprocal relationships.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four education and care reviews in the Blossoms Educare group of centres. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and happy in the centre. They have trusting and respectful relationships with teachers and are developing social skills as they play cooperatively with their peers. Children know about making choices from easily accessible resources and benefit from sustained periods of uninterrupted play. Children are also learning to manage their snack and meal times independently.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy nurturing care and the close attention of teachers as they explore resources indoors and in the playground. They are well settled and benefit from frequent interaction with older children. This supports them to transition into the larger environment when they are two.</p><p>Teachers enthusiastically engage in children’s play. They encourage children to play cooperatively and develop independence. Teachers affirm children’s endeavours, some using questions effectively to foster ideas and prompt children’s use of equipment. They also regularly include cultural activities in the programme which often involves parents and whānau sharing their skills and knowledge. Teachers, could now focus on deepening children's learning through fostering group skills and raising their expectations of children’s competence.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop their planning, assessment and evaluation processes. They regularly observe and discuss children's interests and have successfully documented children's recent exploration of art and craft materials. While teachers provide a wide range of resources and activities to support planned topics they should improve their focus on planning that will guide their teaching practices. They could draw on the best examples of teaching and learning within the Blossoms group to develop a profile of an effective teacher and use this to help grow their skills and knowledge. Taking leadership responsibility for curriculum areas such as literacy, numeracy and science could help teachers to enhance children's communication skills and complex learning opportunities.</p><p>The service leaders are planning further development of the environment. While the outdoors is attractively designed, the owner recognises the need to better utilise space, provide further challenges and reduce the extent of barked areas. The leaders also plan to enhance the range of natural materials indoors and maintain ongoing reviews of play areas.</p><p>The owner provides sound leadership for staff. She provides an inclusive environment, regularly consulting teachers and involving them in decisions about strategic goals, the service’s philosophy, policies and vision. The owner strongly encourages professional development which has significantly helped teachers to extend their understanding of self review, learning stories and biculturalism. The relatively new centre leadership team is being supported to take collaborative responsibility for the centre and guide teacher development. Centre leaders agree they should continue to enhance their internal evaluation processes and strengthen their strategic planning.</p><p>The Blossoms management team is committed to the ongoing development of all centres in the organisation. The team leaders have begun developing an action plan to address the key next steps identified in the current cluster of centre reviews. They are taking responsibility for mentoring and guiding staff while strengthening their expectation that centre managers and teachers will continue to review programme planning, learning extension, internal evaluation and bicultural practices. The management team has plans to further develop its strategic plans and to provide an appropriate appraisal process for the centres' owner. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing teachers’ capability to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation in order to more effectively guide teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen self review to focus evaluations on the effectiveness of practices and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing development of bicultural practice's.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blossoms Educare Riverside completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices centre leaders should shield the window behind the carpentry table.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blossoms Educare Riverside will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
