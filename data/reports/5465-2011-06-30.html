<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham is located in the Burnham Military Camp. Children who attend the kindergarten come from a variety of locations including Burnham camp, Rolleston and outlying rural areas. Since the 2007 ERO review the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten currently operates morning and all day sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two. It is licensed to provide care and education for up to 40 children.</p><p align="left">It is one of sixty three kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the varied and interesting range of learning experiences children choose to take part in, including learning about te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and environmental education</li>
<li>the positive and affirming ways teachers relate to children and their parents</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; consistent use of teaching approaches that foster and extend children&rsquo;s learning and oral language</li>
<li>the good use made of the extensive outdoor environment to promote children&rsquo;s physical development, exploratory play and interest in nature.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The teachers work well together and make good use of their strengths and interests to enhance and improve the programme. Reflective practices, along with ongoing professional development and support, including that given by an association education manager, are continuing to improve the quality of care and education for children.</p><p align="left">The next step for the teachers is to refine and further develop programme planning, assessment and self review practices to increase their quality and usefulness.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten vision is for teachers to encourage children to develop an enthusiasm and passion for learning and exploration through providing a range of learning experiences. They aim to encourage parent and wh&#257;nau involvement and contribution to children&rsquo;s&rsquo; learning and the kindergarten programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Learning Programme</strong></p><p align="left">Teachers provide children with a varied and interesting range of learning experiences. Particular features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the extent to which children have opportunities to make choices, follow their interests and confidently take part in exploratory play</li>
<li>the way teachers help children to develop their oral language skills</li>
<li>the degree to which te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are promoted and effectively integrated.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Relationships</strong></p><p align="left">Teachers relate to children in ways that foster their emotional well-being and sense of belonging. Features of these relationships include:</p><ul>
<li>calm, affirming and responsive interactions</li>
<li>teachers making good use of what they know about individual children to meet their needs</li>
<li>children clearly wanting and valuing teachers&rsquo; involvement in their play.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Positive relationships exist between teachers and parents. Reviewers observed parents choosing to stay and be actively involved in the programme. They also make helpful contributions to programme planning. Parents and teachers both initiate useful discussions about family circumstances and children&rsquo;s interests and development. Teachers are supportive and respond effectively to unique family circumstances, such as the deployment overseas of parents from the military.</p><p><strong>Promoting children&rsquo;s learning</strong></p><p align="left">Teachers use effective approaches to support and extend children&rsquo;s learning. They:</p><ul>
<li>encourage children&rsquo;s participation in activities through teachers&rsquo; own enthusiasm for learning and exploration</li>
<li>notice children&rsquo;s individual interests and skilfully build on these in the programme</li>
<li>use questions and talk with children in ways that help children think, communicate their ideas and motivate them in their learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Learning environment</strong></p><p align="left">The kindergarten physical environment successfully promotes children&rsquo;s learning and development. A feature of this kindergarten is its extensive outdoor environment. This includes a wide range of equipment and spaces that are effectively used to extend children&rsquo;s physical development, interest in nature and environmental education.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten has an interesting and varied range of resources. Children&rsquo;s ready access to these resources helps them to engage in a wide range of exploratory play for sustained periods.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><strong>Programme planning, assessment and self review</strong></p><p align="left">While teachers have developed some effective programme planning, assessment and self review processes, strengthening some aspects of these will enhance their quality and usefulness. For instance:</p><ul>
<li>programme planning and evaluation should include more information about teaching practices and their effectiveness</li>
<li>assessment records should be more consistent in showing how the programme has enhanced key aspects of individual children&rsquo;s learning over time and also better reflect the contributions of parents</li>
<li>greater use of indicators in self reviews to evaluate the success of teaching programmes and practices and to clarify future priorities would help to promote ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this kindergarten understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the kindergarten;</li>
<li>managers and teachers have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this kindergarten works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">There are currently nine M&#257;ori children attending this kindergarten whose parents/wh&#257;nau have identified them as M&#257;ori.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Teachers are committed to providing a bicultural perspective in the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">The emphasis teachers have placed on:</p><ul>
<li>building effective relationships based on teachers&rsquo; knowledge of each family</li>
<li>providing a programme and centre displays that acknowledge and celebrate Maori language, culture and symbols</li>
<li>developing plans and reviewing M&#257;ori children in early childhood education and parent involvement in the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association has recently developed &lsquo;Kidsfirst Wh&#257;nau&rsquo;. This strategy promotes a wh&#257;nau based approach for involving and engaging parents in kindergarten life and their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p align="left">The teachers have identified that their next step is to extend the range of strategies they use to help clarify parents&rsquo; aspirations and involve them in the programme and assessment.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-burnham" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Burnham is located in the Burnham Military Camp. Children who attend the kindergarten come from a variety of locations including Burnham camp, Rolleston and outlying rural areas. Since the 2007 ERO review the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten currently operates morning and all day sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two. It is licensed to provide care and education for up to 40 children.</p><p align="left">It is one of sixty three kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the varied and interesting range of learning experiences children choose to take part in, including learning about te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and environmental education</li>
<li>the positive and affirming ways teachers relate to children and their parents</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; consistent use of teaching approaches that foster and extend children&rsquo;s learning and oral language</li>
<li>the good use made of the extensive outdoor environment to promote children&rsquo;s physical development, exploratory play and interest in nature.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The teachers work well together and make good use of their strengths and interests to enhance and improve the programme. Reflective practices, along with ongoing professional development and support, including that given by an association education manager, are continuing to improve the quality of care and education for children.</p><p align="left">The next step for the teachers is to refine and further develop programme planning, assessment and self review practices to increase their quality and usefulness.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
