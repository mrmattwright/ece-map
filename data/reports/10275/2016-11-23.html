</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (18) Dannemora provides education and care for up to 139 children, including a maximum of 45 children under two years of age. It caters for different age groups in eight separate learning areas. The children enrolled at the centre come from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds and more than half are Chinese. The centre's staff includes 20 teachers and an administrator.</p><p>The Kindercare organisation's philosophy of 'Safe, Loved and Learning' guides centre beliefs and practices, and is prioritised in the centre. Programmes are underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre‚Äôs philosophy statement focuses strongly on inclusive practices, respectful partnership relationships with families and a caring and stimulating environment.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report noted the positive relationships in the centre and the sensitive transitions as children move between rooms. These positive aspects continue to be evident. ERO identified the need for staff to develop their philosophy, improve assessment and planning, and evaluate programmes. The teacher appraisal system required improvement and policies needed to be better aligned with practice. Good progress has been made in a number of areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three Kindercare Learning Centres reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play confidently and enthusiastically. They benefit from unhurried, calm environments and a sense of belonging. Children enjoy conversations and articulate their ideas. The youngest children particularly benefit from consistent staff and nurturing, individualised care in environments that are sensitive to their rhythms and needs.</p><p>Older children are leading their own learning and becoming socially competent problem solvers. The attractive, well resourced environments encourage children's exploration and engagement in play and learning. Respectful teaching practices and sensitively timed interactions support children to settle and become highly focused in their play, both indoors and outdoors.</p><p>Teachers support each other and work well together as a team. They plan the curriculum in response to what they observe about children. Planning is displayed to encourage parents' participation and responses. Teachers celebrate children's progress through documenting their learning in attractive portfolios, which they also make available for parents online.</p><p>Centre leaders work collaboratively to establish and sustain leadership capacity across the centre. The supervisor has developed a strong model of mentoring and coaching for teachers and regularly models effective practice. Leaders have recently focused on developing a centre culture that supports ongoing improvement. Leaders are continuing to work on refining teacher appraisal processes and on ensuring that teaching teams support children's learning effectively.</p><p>A strong commitment to bicultural practices is reflected in the partnerships that teachers establish with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and there is an expectation that teaching practices throughout the centre will promote te ao Maori. Teachers are developing culturally responsive practices that align with their commitment to environmental sustainability and respect for Papat≈´ƒÅnuku.</p><p>The centre's vision, philosophy, strategic approach and annual plan are well aligned and identify a clear direction for the future. Internal evaluation is collaborative and linked to children's learning outcomes, and provides good guidance for centre leaders and teachers.</p><p>Kindercare provides well established systems and policies to guide its centres. These systems are consistently implemented and regularly monitored. The organisation's values and strategic direction also guide each centre. Specific goals are developed by each staff team to guide individual centres. Ongoing support for Kindercare staff ensures centre sustainability, accountability and continued improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that they should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop partnerships with whƒÅnau that focus on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop teaching practices that support children to increase the complexity of their play and extend their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (18) Dannemora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (18) Dannemora will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
