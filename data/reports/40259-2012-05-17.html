<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Lilliput Preschool is located in Tauranga and provides all-day education and care for babies, toddlers and young children up to school age. There are separate age-based areas for children aged under two and over two years.</p>
<p align="left">The centre is privately owned, and operated by a qualified early childhood teacher. She is committed to the provision of quality education and care by well informed, qualified teachers, and maintains generous teacher-child staffing ratios. A strong professional partnership between the centre owner and the supervisor is evident, and teachers are receiving sound direction and guidance.</p>
<p align="left">An attractive, welcoming and well-maintained environment provides safe and interesting areas for play and care. Teachers are knowledgeable and dedicated. They plan an emergent programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s identified and developing interests. A strong emphasis is placed on developing early literacy and mathematical understanding. Children have easy access to an appropriate range of good quality equipment and materials.</p>
<p align="left">The centre places high priority on building positive and reciprocal relationships amongst teachers, children and their families. There are well-embedded processes in place for transitioning children to school.</p>
<p align="left">A comprehensive review of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy for teaching and learning is being planned by centre leaders. Their intention is for this review process to be consultative, informed by current best practice and research in early childhood education, and designed to further enhance the education and care of children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<h3>2. Review Priorities</h3>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Lilliput Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLilliput Preschool.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The centre provides education and care for children in two separate age-based areas, each led by a delegated team leader. The centre supervisor, who is also a team leader, has oversight of day-to-day operations across the centre.</p>
<p align="left">Since the last ERO review in 2009, a more strategic approach to planning professional development has been implemented. This approach is ongoing, involves all staff and is aligned with the appraisal process.</p>
<p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s philosophy for teaching and learning, last reviewed in 2009, is underpinned by Te Wh&#257;riki, (The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum).</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left"><b>Relationships:</b> The centre places high priority on relationship building. Relationships amongst teachers, children and their families are positive and respectful. Teachers make time to informally share information about children&rsquo;s learning and care needs with family members. Their interactions with children are focused and ERO observed some examples of rich learning conversations that extended children&rsquo;s thinking and learning skills. Teachers of the under-twos are skilled in the provision of primary care, and babies and toddlers demonstrate high levels of confidence, in a settled and calm environment. The transition process between the areas is enhanced by the primary care provided by the supervisor.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Environment:</b> The centre provides a welcoming place for children and their families. In the under-two area, teachers plan and present an attractive and interesting environment for babies and toddlers to explore. All children enjoy ready access to well-considered spaces that invite explorative, imaginative and creative play and learning. They are able to choose from a wide range of high-quality equipment and materials. The recently upgraded outdoor environment enables children to experiment with open-ended play and experience appropriate levels of physical challenge. Teachers document and display children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme in attractively presented, individual profiles that are accessible to parents and children. Informative wall displays make the learning visible and enable teachers, children and their parents to revisit memorable learning experiences.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Programme:</b> Dedicated and well-informed teachers plan an emergent programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s identified and developing interests. They demonstrate a genuine desire to engage with children in their play and learning. There are rich, contextual opportunities for children to develop early literacy and mathematical concepts and understandings through play and teacher-led sessions. ERO observed children making choices and sustaining an interest, using information and communication technologies (ICT) to research ideas, and engaging in creative and dramatic play. The programme is enriched by frequent excursions to places of interest in the local and wider community.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Leadership:</b> The centre owner and the supervisor are providing effective leadership. Their collaborative approach contributes to the strong collegial relationships evident amongst staff. Transparent communication processes support and encourage reflective practice. Teachers articulate the positive impact that professional development is having on their practice and outcomes for babies, toddlers and young children.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Centre leaders recognise and ERO agrees that the philosophy for teaching and learning is due for review. Through a comprehensive process of review and development, leaders and teachers will continue to reflect on and revise:</p>
<ul>
<li>the shared rationale for assessment;</li>
<li>biculturalism in the curriculum;</li>
<li>partnerships for learning with parents;</li>
<li>the environment and the range of learning experiences; and</li>
<li>the appraisal process for teachers.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Engaging the services of an external advisor/mentor to work alongside staff in their self-review process is likely to enhance the centre&rsquo;s internal evaluation capacity.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Lilliput Preschool completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<p align="left">An attractive, welcoming and well-maintained environment provides safe and interesting areas for play and care. Teachers are knowledgeable and dedicated. They plan an emergent programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s identified and developing interests. A strong emphasis is placed on developing early literacy and mathematical understanding. Children have easy access to an appropriate range of good quality equipment and materials.</p>
<p align="left">The centre places high priority on building positive and reciprocal relationships amongst teachers, children and their families. There are well-embedded processes in place for transitioning children to school.</p>
<p align="left">A comprehensive review of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy for teaching and learning is being planned by centre leaders. Their intention is for this review process to be consultative, informed by current best practice and research in early childhood education, and designed to further enhance the education and care of children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
