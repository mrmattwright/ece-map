<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>KidStart Waitaki is part of the Barnardos KidStart organisation, operating under the Otago-Southland network. Educators care for up to four children at any one time in their homes. The network is licensed to cater for up to 60 children.</p><p>Children who attend this service receive a very good standard of care and education. Educators are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s care and education needs. The visiting teachers and educators know the children and their families well.</p><p>The key features of this service are:</p><ul>
<li>the warm and positive relationships between adults and children and amongst children</li>
<li>children learn and play in well-resourced, calm and settled environments</li>
<li>the high level of support the educators receive from the visiting teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Children take part in interesting learning experiences within and beyond the home. Educators and children regularly meet for planned activities. A nature programme has been recently developed where children can extend their learning and develop skills within a natural environment.</p><p>ERO and the visiting teachers have identified several next steps for this service. These are to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>educators have an increased focus on supporting children to explore their thinking and concepts about the world around them</li>
<li>reports consistently show the quality of interactions and how these support children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>parents&rsquo; aspirations and expectations are regularly reviewed as their child develops and grows.</li>
</ul><p>There are effective systems and practices in place for the smooth operation of the service. These include well-developed and useful templates, guidelines, policies and procedures.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the last ERO review in February 2011, Barnardos Homebased Care Services has undergone changes to its management structure and practices. The outcome of these changes is likely to result in visiting teachers having increased time to work with educators.</p><p>KidStart Waitaki aims to provide a service that &lsquo;is safe and friendly, where all learning is valued and encouraged.&rsquo;</p><p>ERO reviewers observed the programme in action in three educators&rsquo; homes. These visits were arranged by the service. The visiting teachers and educators endeavour to offer a programme which allows children to develop a range of skills and follow their own interests.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Children learn and play in environments that support their wellbeing and belonging. Educators are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s care and education and quickly establish warm and nurturing relationships with them. Children demonstrate trust in their educators and take pleasure in the visits of their visiting teacher.</p><p>Children enjoy regular outings to local shops, parks and playgrounds. Educators attend a weekly playgroup to provide the children with social and community experiences. A recent development has been a nature programme where children can develop a variety of skills while exploring the natural environment. Children have access to a wide range of resources both indoor and outdoor play. ERO observed educators joining in play and following the children&rsquo;s interests. The variety of environments and homes visited provide good spaces for exploration. Children&rsquo;s learning profiles are often shared with parents.</p><p>Educators are well supported by the two visiting teachers who work collaboratively to achieve the high expectations they share for improving educators&rsquo; practices. The quality of support is evident in the improvement of children&rsquo;s learning stories and the ongoing development of bicultural practices. They provide educators with interesting information and resources to help them develop their knowledge and understanding. Visiting teachers actively seek ways to gather input from parents about their child&rsquo;s learning and educators&rsquo; practices.</p><p>Visiting teachers set goals with educators to build on best practice. The next step is for educators to show that what they do supports the most important goals of the service.</p><p>There are very good processes for educators and visiting teachers to review the effectiveness of what they are doing. Reviews include:</p><ul>
<li>indicators to measure progress against</li>
<li>recommendations and further actions that are leading to positive outcomes for children.</li>
<li>links to the strategic plan, performance management and feedback to educators.</li>
</ul><p>Visiting teachers acknowledge that as part of review they need to monitor how well practices are being enacted and what impact they have on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>There are useful systems and practices in place for the effective management of the home-based care service. These include well-developed and useful templates, guidelines, policies and procedures.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO has identified, and visiting teachers agree, that:</p><ul>
<li>there is a need for educators to have a greater focus on helping children to explore their thinking and understanding about the world around them</li>
<li>visiting teacher reports need to more consistently show the quality of interactions and how these support children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>educators regularly revisit the &lsquo;all about me sheets&rsquo; to ensure that parents&rsquo; emerging aspirations and expectations are current as their child develops and grows.</li>
</ul><p>The visiting teachers need to provide ongoing support for educators to develop their bicultural practices. This support should include helping educators to show bicultural perspectives in children&rsquo;s learning stories.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of KidStart Waitaki completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
