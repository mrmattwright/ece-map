</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Opunake Playcentre is a community-based service located in rural Taranaki. The centre is licensed for 30 children and offers two sessions each week. Children who identify as Māori make up a third of the roll.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 parent-led services governed under the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association) umbrella. The governance of these centres has recently reverted to a structure where all centre representatives contribute to association decisions and priorities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents as educators work collaboratively to promote and support children’s learning through play. Children’s emerging interests are documented and updated to assist ongoing planning and evaluation of learning. Continued targeted support and documented feedback through associationled initiatives should continue to increase parents’ knowledge of assessment.</p><p>As a response to ERO's 2010 report, increased emphasis on bicultural perspectives and opportunities for Māori children to achieve success as Māori are evident. A group of parent bicultural office holders, using external support, is beginning to lead initiatives to increase the use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Children enjoy using resources including the developing whare space to celebrate and promote their identity and culture. These developments are supported by the Puriri W’akamaru o Taranaki role established by the association to build bicultural understandings. Acknowledged next steps are to develop strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children to enjoy success as Māori.</p><p>Parents, whānau and children are encouraged and supported to take on leadership roles. Collaborative leadership that demonstrates a commitment to the centre philosophy and principles of the early childhood curriculum are evident. Good use of succession planning and training enables emergent leaders to gain experience and the benefit of support from former office holders at the centre.</p><p>Creativity and dramatic play are valued. Children have many opportunities to express themselves through well-resourced learning spaces. Literacy and numeracy are appropriately integrated into the curriculum.</p><p>High adult-to-child ratios assist positive and productive interactions that are responsive and affirming. Toddlers and babies are well catered for to make secure attachments with parents, adults and other children. Supervised mixed-age learning enables children to develop through tuakana teina relationships.</p><p>Parents are developing knowledge and confidence to plan learning that is responsive to children’s interests. Planned excursions and cultural days enrich children’s experiences and opportunities to extend their learning. Association support for parents to further develop assessment skills should assist with evaluating the quality of curriculum and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Both Opunake Playcentre and the association have annual plans that inform operational decisions. However, there are few links between the association and individual playcentre goals. The association’s strategic vision does not effectively focus on priorities for improving teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre's annual strategic plans involve a comprehensive list of centre-driven priorities, tasks and operations, some of which appropriately include ongoing improvement in the quality of teaching, assessment and learning. To better assist self review of centre effectiveness, more specific action plans and success indicators should be developed for monitoring progress towards goals in these key areas.</p><p>Generic association policies guide or inform many centre practices. ERO and centre leaders identify the need to review and develop some policies, procedures and practices to better cater for the needs and aspirations of parents and whānau. This includes review and evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of programmes and strategies for children’s transitions to school.</p><p>Regular visits by association personnel provide advice and guidance. Positive relationships between playcentres and those in support roles are evident. The association offers opportunities for parents to train in the playcentres’ early childhood education courses. Extending and improving the support the association offers to playcentres is an important next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders, in partnership with the association, should:</p><ul>
<li>provide parents with targeted support in assessment</li>
<li>further develop annual plans so that success goals and expected outcomes for children are more specific and measurable</li>
<li>further develop their understanding and use of self review to update policies, practices and annual priorities across the centre.</li>
</ul><p>The association would benefit from external support to strengthen and improve its understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>annual and strategic planning that better informs priorities for teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relevant approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fostering opportunities for Māori children and whānau to have success as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting members understanding of teaching and learning and regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>current approaches to self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opunake Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Opunake Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
