</table><p>Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool, in Mangere East, is a bilingual Samoan centre that provides education and care for 60 children, including up to 15 aged under two years. Most children attending are Samoan, and there are small numbers from other Pacific groups. The preschool provides separate spaces for younger and older children, who have opportunities to interact and participate together at centre and church events.</p><p>The centre operates under the Taeaofou I Puaseisei Trust and the Christian Congregational Church of Samoa. In 2018 the trust opened another centre, Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool - Winthrop, in the same neighbourhood. A centre manager takes responsibility for the day-to-day management and leadership of both centres. Since the 2015 ERO review, there has been an increase in the number of qualified teachers. Low staff turnover has helped teachers to build close relationships with families over time.</p><p>The centre's purpose is to develop Pacific children's cultural pride and identity, emphasising the Samoan language and culture, and Christian values. Its philosophy statement acknowledges the importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report included recommendations to improve teachers' capability through professional learning, responsiveness to children's strengths and interests, and strategies for extending children's thinking. It also identified the need to strengthen early literacy and mathematics through the programme and environment. While some progress has been made, these areas continue to be priorities for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme and teachers' interactions with children reinforce children's cultural identity and sense of belonging at the preschool. The centre manager and her staff ensure that gagana and aganu'u Samoa are integral parts of the daily programme. Children have opportunities to participate in local community and church events. Nurturing care for infants and toddlers is modelled well by some teachers.</p><p>Teachers are becoming more child-focused in their programme planning, assessment and evaluation. They use a planning model that guides teachers to notice, recognise and respond to children's interests and learning. The centre manager agrees that there are some good models of assessment and planning that could be used to promote more consistent curriculum management practices.</p><p>The preschool's curriculum is currently under review. Teachers have participated in professional learning to help them to better integrate literacy and mathematics in the programme and environment. As teachers make more meaningful connections to children's learning interests, consideration needs to be given to providing learning resources that will enable children to be curious and challenge their thinking. Ongoing professional development will be essential for the teaching team to implement these changes.</p><p>The preschool has several ways to share children's learning and interests with their parents. There are interviews twice a year and an end of year report, as well as regular conversations with staff when parents drop off or pick up their children from the centre. Leaders plan to continue to grow parents' involvement and partnership in children's learning.</p><p>Members of the trust board have a strong commitment to the cultural philosophy and growth of the centre. They value the preschool's role in providing a service for the local Samoan community and families. The preschool has good systems and processes for health and safety management. The manager reports to the trust board, and the board's meeting records show a focus on progress towards annual goals. The trust, and manager continue to develop evaluation practices. They have established a schedule for reviewing policies and procedures. Teachers' evaluation and inquiry into the effectiveness of their own practice are at an early stage of development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include teachers engaging with external professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase their responsiveness to children's strengths and interests to promote their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve children's access to resources that provide more challenge, and extend their thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support children to lead their own learning, and younger children to learn self-help skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop teaching practices related to current best practice and the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain written records of their reflections on evidence for each of the Teaching Standards, and of their professional learning<em>.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>As part of the planned leadership restructure for the two centres, it will be worthwhile to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each leader in supporting and building teaching capability.</p><p>Key next steps for managers include external professional support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure more frequent written feedback is shared with each teacher about their individual goals and the Teaching Council Standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarify the performance appraisal policy and procedures, and the link between annual appraisal and the three yearly endorsement of teachers' practising certificates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a mentoring programme for teachers who hold provisional practising certificates.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The service will provide ERO with an action plan that shows how key next steps identified in this report, and actions for compliance, will be addressed. ERO will request a progress update in six months.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taeaofou I Puaseisei Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>15 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
