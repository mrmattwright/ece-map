</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikanae Beach Kids is a privately owned early childhood centre providing full-day education and care for twenty five children up to school age, including five children up to two years. The centre is one of several operating under the service provider G. Williams Daycare Limited.</p><p>The provider recently appointed a visiting teacher who leads the implementation of strategic goals and oversees systems and procedures, and a head teacher for onsite leadership and administration. Together they are leading the process of reviewing centre-wide policies, procedures and teaching programmes to gain a shared understanding of areas for development.</p><p>The well-planned, complementary indoor and outdoor environments support children of all ages to explore a wide range of challenges, resources and opportunities to extend their learning.</p><p>The centre philosophy is currently under review to establish a foundation for setting shared high expectations of good practice and outcomes for all children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre leaders and staff effectively promote positive outcomes for children through a range of wellplanned and responsive programmes, receptive teaching practices and respectful relationships.</p><p>Children are well engaged, interact positively with peers and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Interactions with teachers are positive and respectful. Teachers are welcoming and provide meaningful contexts for play, exploration and discussion with children. Teachers provide feedback that acknowledges children's successes.</p><p>In the up-to-twos area, interactions are caring and support young children to develop a sense of self. Teachers are responsive to verbal and non-verbal communications and children's needs. Warm respectful relationships are evident.</p><p>Teachers make good use of opportunities for learning within routines. They engage in authentic dialogue in meaningful contexts to promote learning and to extend children's oral language and thinking.</p><p>Interactions are deliberately established to support children's knowledge and confidence in using te¬†reo MƒÅori. Strong whƒÅnau relationships and increasing parental involvement in the centre are evident. Parents' aspirations for their children are known, updated and reported on twice during the year. Maori children's language and culture are affirmed through aspects of the programme and interactions with teachers.</p><p>Portfolios are engaging and present inviting records of children's learning at the centre. They contain regular, useful stories and summaries to capture learning over time. It is evident that an ongoing focus has resulted in an increase in quality and consistency in these records over the past two years. Links are made to parents' aspirations and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Further reference should be made to cultural aspirations, language and identity in learning stories and portfolios.</p><p>Planning is well informed by children's interests and some links to parent aspirations. It is regularly displayed for sharing with parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers identify daily learning and possible activities to continue and extend the subsequent learning. More revisiting of experiences should better help children enrich and consolidate their learning.</p><p>Transitions within the centre are deliberate, planned and supported. Leaders are establishing stronger links with schools and the local marae to further develop learning partnerships.</p><p>Leaders are improvement focused and have developed effective systems for sharing expectations and building staff capability of staff through professional learning and development. Leaders' feedback and suggestions for improvement are well documented and aligned to strategic and self-review priorities.</p><p>The newly developed appraisal system and strategic priorities provide useful frameworks for expectations and vision for the future. The centre leader models good teaching practice and provides useful support for developing teachers' knowledge and skills.</p><p>Self-review processes, reflection and evaluation are well used to inform centre-wide improvements in outcomes for children and teaching practices across the centre. Leaders model and promote inquiry processes and the monitoring of initiatives to address children's identified needs. Leaders agree that ongoing building of teachers' inquiry and evaluation capability is a next step. Well established administration and governance systems provide for consistency and stability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree the next step is to further refine the evaluation of teaching and learning programmes to:</p><p><span>better capture</span> the growth in children's learning over time</p><ul>
<li>
<p>gauge how well deliberate teaching strategies impact on this learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider how well English language learning acquisition strategies support children whose home language is other than English.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikanae Beach Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waikanae Beach Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>10 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
