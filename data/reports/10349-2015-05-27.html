</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dragonfly Early Learning Centre (ELC) provides full day education and care for up to 50 children, including up to 16 infants and toddlers less than two years of age. The centre is well established and was bought by Evolve Education Group at the end of 2014. This is the service‚Äôs first ERO review under the management of its new owner.</p><p>Improvements have been made to the leadership structure of the centre. A business manager and professional service manager (PSM) provide external support on a regular basis. A new head teacher position has been created to help ensure the smooth daily operation of the centre.</p><p>The majority of the regular staff are registered teachers and there are high ratios of teachers to children. Most children are of NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ descent, and a small number of children from a diverse range of ethnicities also attend.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended that teachers further support older children to develop more complexity in their play, problem solving, and thinking and reasoning skills. It also encourages teachers to refine the documentation of strategies to support and evaluate children‚Äôs learning, and critically reflect on their own practices.</p><p>In response to the 2012 ERO report, centre managers and staff have made some progress in improving self review, the environment and bicultural practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled and are generally engaged in activities. They are developing self-help skills. Teachers promote respectful relationships throughout the centre. Interactions are friendly and sociable, providing children with good opportunities to participate in group discussions. Infants and toddlers are able to freely explore the indoor and outdoor learning environments.</p><p>Teachers plan topics to provide opportunities for children to increase their knowledge. They see children as capable learners. Their challenge is to now provide experiences that further encourage the development of children‚Äôs thinking and problem solving skills.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs learning philosophy is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The educational programme and environment for infants and toddlers are guided by RIE and Reggio Emilia approaches. Staff are continuing to learn more about the benefits of these approaches to support the younger children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs bicultural curriculum continues to develop. Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnerships and the place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua of Aotearoa/New Zealand are valued. Children learn about, and enjoy participating in, tikanga and using te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers have recently focused more specifically on gathering information about parents‚Äô aspirations for their children. Parents are encouraged to contribute their ideas to strengthen children‚Äôs learning records in their individual portfolios. A computerised record of children‚Äôs learning is being introduced so that teachers and parents can work together more readily to extend children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers place emphasis on helping children to develop positive attitudes to learning. They also focus on preparing older children for their transition to school. Teachers use current research to inform their thinking, and meet with teachers from the local primary school to develop shared understandings about the best ways to support this transition process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre manager, team leaders and PSM agree that in order to continue enhancing the quality of learning provided for children they now need to:</p><ul>
<li>review and analyse their practice to ensure that it reflects the centre philosophy</li>
<li>continue their focus on developing children‚Äôs individual interests and learning dispositions</li>
<li>engage more frequently in learning-focused interactions that challenge children‚Äôs thinking and extend their learning</li>
<li>continue to progress staff understanding and use of self review.</li>
</ul><p>Teaching staff should also consider long-term strategies to support the planned future directions for the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dragonfly Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dragonfly Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
