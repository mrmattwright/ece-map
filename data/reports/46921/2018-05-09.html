</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Poimaino 1 Homebased Childcare is one of six home-based education and care networks in the Poimaino Homebased Childcare Services Limited organisation. The network provides for up to 60 children, from infancy to school age. Currently there are 13 educators whose homes are located in Mangere, East and Central Auckland. There are 44 children enrolled in this network and most children are Tongan. The licensee and staff communicate with, and provide information for families in both English and Tongan. This network has one coordinator. Many educators are family members of the children who attend.</p><p>Poimaino 1 opened in 2016, and since then the other five networks have been licensed. The service is led by the owner/licensee. She works with the coordinators from all six networks, and is involved in all aspects of service operations. Each network operates under the Poimaino policies, procedures and philosophy.</p><p>The service's philosophy reflects the definition of Poimaino which means teaching and caring, similar to the role of a shepherd. The philosophy expresses the value of the home environment where children are nurtured to flourish and develop to their potential. It emphasises children's cultures, and sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. The coordinators are qualified early childhood teachers with current practising teacher certificates. They regularly visit each educator, and together plan educational programmes for children.</p><p>This is the first ERO report of the service.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four network reviews in the Poimaino Homebased Childcare Services Limited organisation. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service is underpinned by clear professional expectations of staff, and continuing development of frameworks for strategic development and evaluation. Good practices for monitoring children's wellbeing, health and safety are maintained, particularly for those children under two years of age, and for children with additional learning needs.</p><p>The licensee and coordinators work together as a professional and supportive team. Their philosophy of home-based education and care and the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are evident in their planning, practice, and service documentation.</p><p>Inclusive relationships and partnerships guide children's learning and service development. The licensee and coordinators work as a professional team focused on developing a quality programme for children and a quality service for parents. Parents are encouraged to contribute to their children's learning programmes. Coordinators and educators regularly communicate with families in a variety of ways, including formal interviews with parents.</p><p>Appropriate planning and assessment practices guide programmes for children. Coordinators and educators work together to develop monthly plans that are topical or reflect children's common interests. Tongan children benefit from educators' knowledge and use of the Tongan language and cultural practices. Children are encouraged to talk and learn in their own language. They have regular opportunities to meet and play with other children across the network at playgroups and on trips.</p><p>Coordinators and educators have reviewed and adapted documentation for curriculum planning, assessment and evaluation. These updated records are shared with parents. The coordinators' monthly reports record information about the children's programmes and activities.</p><p>Coordinators benefit from both internal and external professional development relevant to the context and rapid growth of this new service. They participate in professional learning together. This support is helping to increase their understanding about effective practices that best promote children's education and care. Coordinators provide educators with support and guidance through monthly workshops and home visits. </p><p>Internal evaluation continues to be a key focus of professional development in the service, from strategic planning to curriculum provision. Developing evaluation practices would help the licensee and staff to achieve the service's strategic goals, and support each child's individual learning. An external facilitator will continue to support the coordinators' professional development in evaluation.</p><p>The service's appraisal processes are currently being developed to support coordinators and educators to develop their teaching practice. This term, the external facilitator will provide professional development to the licensee and coordinators to guide this work, and to align coordinators' appraisals with the Education Council requirements. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The licensee has identified relevant priorities for development that include:</p><ul>
<li>further professional learning regarding the revised national curriculum <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em> to develop teaching practice that is focused on children's learning outcomes</li>
<li>increasing parents' contribution to children's learning</li>
<li>strengthening the support for older children's readiness for school</li>
<li>continuing to develop internal evaluation practices to guide the service's ongoing development</li>
<li>developing appraisal processes to align with Education Council requirements.  </li>
</ul><p>ERO also identified next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the focus on curriculum and outcomes for children in supervisors' monthly reports</li>
<li>focusing more on children's learning dispositions, for example: curiosity, perseverance, problem solving </li>
<li>making more explicit reference in the philosophy to children's learning, the Tongan context of this service, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi and respect for te ao Māori</li>
<li>strengthening the links between the service's strategic and annual planning, internal evaluation and coordinators' appraisal goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Poimaino 1 Homebased Childcare completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>After a recent audit by the Ministry of Education (MoE) the service has changed its practices regarding funding entitlement for educators who are family members. The MoE will carry out a review of these changes later this year. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Poimaino 1 Homebased Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>9 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
