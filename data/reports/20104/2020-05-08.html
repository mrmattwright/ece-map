</table><p>BestStart Ponsonby¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Ponsonby provides all-day education and care for up to 68 children, including up to 36 children under the age of two years. The children mostly come from the local community.</p><p>Children are catered for in age-related groups in three buildings: The Babies Cottage (infants and toddlers), The Big House (approximately two to four-year olds) and The Workshop (the preschool group). Children in the Babies Cottage have a separate outdoor area. The older children share a large outdoor space.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart charitable trust. The organisation has re-branded all its early learning services. BestStart provides an overarching governance and management framework to support operations and curriculum delivery in individual centres. Business Managers (BM) and Professional Services Managers (PSM) facilitate staff professional development and provide strategic guidance.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, bicultural practices and partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau. The centre's philosophy reflects with <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em> and a commitment to the principles of the Treaty of <span lang="mi">Waitangi</span>.</p><p>The centre is led by an experienced manager with the support of an assistant manager. It employs a high percentage of qualified teachers and a cook.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report commented positively on the education and care provision for children, bicultural practices, and relationships with families. It identified areas for improvement that included building teachers' confidence to use <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori</span> and extending the learning of older children. Teachers have participated in professional learning and development to support their understanding of <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori</span>.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the BestStart Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to benefit from positive and supportive relationships with their teachers. Interactions are respectful and promote children's sense of wellbeing and participation. Teachers' conversations with children support language development and encourage them to develop social competencies.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. Parents are encouraged to share their aspirations for their children so that teachers can consider these when planning for individual children.</p><p>Children under the age of two years are well cared for and supported to learn. The primary caregiver approach used in the Babies Cottage helps ensure a sense of belonging for the children and good communication with parents.</p><p>Learning environments are well organised and well resourced. The indoor areas provide discreet play areas that enable children to sustain their play and access equipment to support their play. The outdoor areas are spacious and encourage physical activity and exploration.</p><p>Teachers provide aspects of <span lang="mi">te ao MƒÅori</span> in the curriculum. They use some <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori</span> in their interactions with children and in the environment, and some routines reflect the bicultural heritage of <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand.</p><p>The cultures of the children at the centre are known by the staff and recognised through centre events and wall displays. Teachers encourage parents to contribute to children's electronic records of learning and share information about children's experiences outside the centre.</p><p>Assessment and planning processes are under review and development. Teachers are exploring how they can more effectively record what they know about children's learning, and how they plan for individuals.</p><p>The centre manager provides opportunities for staff to grow professionally. She encourages teachers to take leadership roles. Ongoing professional development ensures that their professional knowledge and curriculum knowledge is current and consistent across the centre. The appraisal system promotes teacher reflection and inquiry into their practice.</p><p>Good systems for internal evaluation guide and inform teaching and learning, which results in improved practices that promote positive outcomes for children. Professional learning and development is a focus for building teacher capabilities and has impacted positively on teaching practices. The service provides opportunities for leadership within the team.</p><p>National, regional and centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans, and a shared vision which monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promote a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and support more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Professional learning and development have a focus for building capabilities and has impacted positively on teaching practices. The service provides opportunities for emergent leadership within the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to continue strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning by clarifying strategic goals and more consistently monitoring progress towards the goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review by more consistently using evaluative questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programme planning and assessment processes to make planning more explicit and show children's learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Agreed next steps for the organisation are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural understanding and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk analysis management systems, processes and procedures for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes to support teachers‚Äô continuum of professional knowledge and practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Ponsonby completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>8 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
