</table><p>Appleton Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Appleton Kindergarten, located in Dannevirke, Tararua, is licensed to provide all day education and care for 40 children over two years of age. Of the 45 children attending, 25 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of two early learning services managed by the Dannevirke Kindergarten Association (the association). A governing body sets the service's strategic direction and goals. An association manager has overall responsibility for the day-to-day operation and human resource management. The association contracts the services of a professional practice manager to provide advice and guidance to teaching teams. Head teachers are appointed to each kindergarten and have delegated responsibility for leading teaching and learning and the day-to-day operation of the service.</p><p>There have been significant staffing changes since the June 2016 ERO review.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is articulated through overarching statements. These are for children to shine through being seen in a positive light. 'Adults will water children with kind words. Children will be nurtured in a safe environment and they will children grow with opportunities to explore'. These conditions encourage 'a culture of kindness' and promote the intended outcomes for children of 'respect, honesty, enthusiasm, responsibility, kindness and patience'.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two in the Dannevirke Kindergarten Association.</p><p>This service is a member of the Dannevirke KƒÅhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning, development and wellbeing is fostered within a culture of care and respect. The physical learning environment with its extensive and appropriate resourcing is attractively presented and inviting. Children have ready access to experiences that promote their foundational learning skills in literacy, mathematics and science. Creative, curious children enthusiastically explore and engage in learning opportunities of high interest to them.</p><p>The enactment of the service philosophy is evident in practice. The curriculum aligns with the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em>. Children have purposeful and sustained involvement in both spontaneous and planned learning.</p><p>Practices for building individual teacher capability are supportive. Due to significant staff turnover in recent years, internal evaluation has not been as robustly implemented as intended. It has however continued to result in improved practice. The learner-focused internal evaluation model includes appropriate teacher inquiry aligned to appraisal. Improvement actions support the service's annual goals and aims and the association's strategic direction.</p><p>Deliberate actions to improve curriculum provision for MƒÅori learners has included the introduction of kaupapa MƒÅori assessment practice. This continues to become embedded. More confident teachers authentically, meaningfully and confidently include te reo and te ao MƒÅori in daily practice. They are positive role models for relievers and those teachers whose knowledge-base and experience is less.</p><p>Association managers and leaders should review how they support relieving teachers' ongoing professional growth. They need to be assured relievers understand and follow association expectations and are confident to contribute to assessment, curriculum planning and implementation.</p><p>It is timely to review the association's policies and procedures in relation to the Vulnerable Children's Act 2014. The association needs to be assured all staff are aware of their responsibilities to the Act and procedures and practices meet these.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Association managers and leaders should provide ongoing training and development to support all teachers' professional growth.</p><p>Continuing to build all teachers' capability to use internal evaluation effectively to sustain the good practices happening and continually improve teaching and learning for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Appleton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>
