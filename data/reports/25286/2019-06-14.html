</table><p>Highland Park Community Creche Inc.¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Highland Park Community Creche operates in the mornings and is licensed for 16 children, including five under the age of two years. The creche philosophy promotes love, trust, empathy, and a play-based approach to learning.</p><p>The centre is an incorporated society and is governed by the Highland Park Community House management committee, comprising of parents and teachers from the creche. The long-serving teaching team includes a centre manager and two other registered teachers.</p><p>The current focus of the committee and teachers is to continue to provide a service for children and families, while managing within financial constraints.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted positive features including affirming interactions with children, the play-based programme, and the well informed and supportive management committee. These practices have been sustained. Areas for improvement in 2014 included the bicultural curriculum, teachers' appraisal, self review, and strategic planning. These remain areas for ongoing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled at the centre. They have developed positive relationships with teachers and play well with and alongside each other. Teachers use the indoor and outdoor spaces effectively to create an environment that enables children to follow their interests. Children access a wide variety of resources.</p><p>The philosophy is well enacted by teachers who know the children and families well. They engage with children in positive, nurturing and welcoming ways, and demonstrate inclusive practices. Teachers support all children effectively, including those with additional learning needs. They support children's play and exploration successfully, and children have good opportunities to sustain their play.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO report their appreciation of the support their children have received to settle, grow, and develop at the creche. Parents support the creche and participate in its activities enthusiastically. Teachers prioritise engaging with families and building strong relationships with them. Some records of children's learning show parent contributions.</p><p>Teachers use basic phrases and words in te reo MƒÅori as they interact with children. Teachers could continue to improve the integration of MƒÅori concepts throughout the curriculum, and consider ways to reflect children's cultures and home languages in their practices and documentation.</p><p>Assessment records show children's participation in a range of activities, and some identify children's interests and dispositions. There is information for parents about how play can promote children's learning. The programme is based on the provision of interesting resources and activities. Teachers are continuing to develop their knowledge about implementing <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the revised early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have identified internal evaluation as an area for further development. They are reviewing and updating some policies to ensure they continue to meet current requirements. The revised teacher appraisal process should include formal observations, more professional goal setting, and should be undertaken annually. The annual plan is focused on supporting the creche to maintain its day-to-day operations and strengths.</p><p>Teachers promote a collaborative culture and are supported by the management committee. The committee is appreciative of teachers' commitment to ensuring the sustainability of the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy to include an emphasis on children's learning and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and responsiveness to children's cultures and the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to improve assessment and planning by making it clear how teachers plan to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop and use internal evaluation to focus on improvements that benefit children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Highland Park Community Creche Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found areas of non-compliance in the service related to policies and procedures. To address these, teachers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the procedure for monitoring children's sleep states that children do not have access to food or liquids in bed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excursion records include evidence of parental permission and approval of adult:child ratios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies include all the requirements of the Children's Act.<br><br><i>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS9,17,31, GMA7,7A; Children's Act 2014</i></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Steve Tanner Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>14 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
