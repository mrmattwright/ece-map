</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Esk Valley Kindergarten is a new kindergarten governed by the Waimate Kindergarten Association and is one of a cluster of two. The association also provides a mobile service that operates in the surrounding district. A general manager has responsibility for the overall operation. A senior teacher supports the teachers with their professional practice.</p><p>The kindergarten provides early childhood education to twenty children from two years of age to school age. Families and children attending are from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities. The new head teacher had been in the role for three months at the time of the review. The number of children attending the service has grown quickly since it opened two years ago. The increase has led to the association extending the days they are open from three sessions each week to a four-day week beginning this term. The sessions are provided in a building with limited space. This provides a challenge that the association, teachers, children and families manage well.</p><p>This is the kindergarten's first ERO review under its new name.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Esk Valley Kindergarten welcomes families from a wide rural area who enjoy the opportunity to be together. The new head teacher has settled quickly into her role which has been helped by a strong sense of whanaungatanga within the community. Teachers effectively model inclusive behaviour through thoughtful, sensitive practices. They value the multicultural nature of the centre and work together to support the range of individual strengths, interests and needs of the children who attend. </p><p>Teachers make use of incidental conversations with children to effectively build children's confidence to explore and understand the world around them. Teachers are particularly skilled at integrating learning in oral language and mathematics. Children are listened to, their views and ideas respected and teachers encourage them to be decision makers. They are able to make choices and be independent. Teachers support children with social development. Children were seen teaching and learning from one another through the strong friendships they have formed. They work and play cooperatively over time without the need for adult involvement.</p><p>Children are showing a developing interest in te reo and tikanga Māori and initiate learning in this area. The teachers intentionally teach te reo Māori during mat time. Children are becoming familiar with local stories, can say a mihi and enjoy singing waiata. Teachers are growing their understanding of Māori concepts. They have benefited from and greatly value the connections they have with local iwi and are planning ways to ensure they maintain and build on these connections.</p><p>Other features of the service that promote positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the effective support teachers give children with special needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the teachers' ability to critically reflect on children's learning and the impact of their teaching on learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the range of relevant resources and activities teachers provide that link with children's home-life experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the regular gathering and use of parents' views and aspirations for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The capable manager and kindergarten head teacher are improvement focused. The head teacher and teachers reflect daily on practice and use the information they collect to plan and evaluate programmes and their teaching. They recently identified the service’s key learning priorities for children’s learning and have begun to plan how to ensure these are achieved.</p><p>The internal-evaluation processes and practices used by the service have been effective. There have been useful planned and spontaneous reviews with positive outcomes for children. These practices now need to be consolidated with the new team. A schedule of reviews that includes key aspects of learning and teaching may be useful in guiding future development. The manager plans to review the internal evaluation system to ensure policy reviews are manageable and include evaluation against practice.</p><p>The governing body, manager and senior teacher work collaboratively to provide effective support to the service and ensure systems are cohesive and well aligned. There are practices in place to support ongoing improvements and manage health and safety. A strategic plan clearly states the association's philosophy, vision and values. Relevant strategic goals are closely monitored through a useful annual plan. The head teacher reports to the board regularly against annual goals. A robust appraisal system is embedding well.</p><p>Key next steps for the service have been identified by the manager, senior teacher and head teacher and ERO agrees. These are stated above and include continuing to develop and implement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the assessment and planning system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice and the integration of Māori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the recently identified centre-wide learning priorities for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Esk Valley Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified the need for the association to update the kindergarten's appraisal and appointments policies to meet new requirements. This was being attended to while ERO was on site.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Esk Valley Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>24 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
