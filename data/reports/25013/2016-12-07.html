</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pakuranga Montessori is a privately owned centre providing education and care for up to 39 children from two to six years of age. The centre was previously reviewed as Hilltop Kindergarten in 2008. New owners took over the management and renamed the centre in September 2014. Hours of operation have increased to meet the needs of the community.</p><p>The centre manager and owner have both a strong commitment to providing quality education and care. Three of the five teachers are registered and most have Montessori qualifications. New management systems have been put into place. The centre owner and manager have focused on developing positive relationships with the parents and local community.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs Montessori philosophy and increasing influence of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum informs the programme and teaching practices. The centre goals include offering children a programme that where children can thrive as socially, competent, independent thinkers with a lifelong love of learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are busy, have fun and are engaged learners. They hear and use home languages, other than English, and are caring and respectful of others. Children are confident, explore freely and are trusting of adults and helpful towards other children. They play and learn at a relaxed pace in a calm, supportive environment.</p><p>Teachers understand and provide well for the emotional and physical wellbeing of children. They encourage healthy eating and promote self-help skills. The centre is well resourced with Montessori activities and other early childhood resources. The outdoor area provides challenge and space for active play. Children's curiosity is nurtured and they have opportunities to lead and join group activities.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement a curriculum with a strong Montessori approach and an increasing focus on <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. They provide opportunities for children to use literacy, mathematics, and science through the Montessori curriculum and through play. Assessment and planning processes are becoming more responsive to children‚Äôs interests. Children‚Äôs assessment portfolios are highly valued records of children's involvement in the programme. Parents are provided with good information about the curriculum and are invited to share their ideas and goals.</p><p>Teachers model a shared belief in the centre's Montessori philosophy and interact with children with respect and courtesy. Teachers value children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds, are inclusive, and prepare the environment to meet children's learning needs. They support individual children and families as they move on to school. Teachers provide good support for children's oral language in English and affirm children's use of home languages. They continue to strengthen their bicultural practices and use of te reo MƒÅori in the programme<em>.</em></p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and benefit from the centre manager‚Äôs professional leadership. Their leadership and teaching practices are fostered through ongoing professional development<em>.</em></p><p>Centre operations are underpinned by a strong focus on children and families with a clear vision for improvement. Centre leaders are well supported by an external provider to implement effective management systems and to develop policies and procedures. Internal evaluation is developing and used to guide decision making<em>.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making the implementation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> more visible in programme planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing assessment, planning and evaluation that more consistently shows how teachers extend children‚Äôs thinking and individual interests over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving teaching strategies to build on spontaneous learning opportunities in the outdoor area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a robust documented system of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an annual action plan to monitor progress and record evidence based outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pakuranga Montessori Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The service leaders identified an area of non-compliance prior to the onsite stage of the review. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><p>Develop and implement an appraisal process that ensures that all staff are regularly appraised and meets Education Council requirements.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Education and Care Services 2008 GMA7.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pakuranga Montessori Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
