<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>AUT Centre for Refugee Education Early Childhood Centre is a well-established service providing care and education for the children of newly arrived refugee families. The centre operates under the auspices of Auckland University of Technology (AUT) who manage the resettlement programme and facility for the Refugee Quota of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Six annual intakes of families live at the facility for six weeks before resettling in communities throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>The centre is part of a large multi-service site including temporary accommodation, schooling, adult classes, and social, medical, interpreting and immigration support. Families come from highly diverse and often traumatic and challenging backgrounds.</p>
<p>Since the 2013 ERO review a head teacher has been appointed to manage daily centre operations. She is well supported by AUT managers who have overall responsibility for the ECE service and school. An advisory group supports the management team and families' wellbeing and resettlement, and advises the teaching team on community or educational cross-sector issues.</p>
<p>Most of the teachers are registered and are either bilingual or multilingual. Staff reflect the diverse cultures of the children and many have a personal understanding of families' situations.</p>
<p>The 2013 ERO report identified a strong sense of community, and this promoted children's wellbeing and belonging. Teachers were responsive to children's individual needs, interests and preferences. These positive aspects have been further embedded by the head teacher and staff. Managers and teachers have responded very well to the 2013 ERO recommendations to promote high quality education and care for children. Some progress has been made towards the management and governance recommendations.¬†</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>A holistic approach to the programme, leadership and teaching is resulting in very positive outcomes for children. Teachers have high expectations for children and their families. Children are well engaged in learning activities. They know routines well and take on leadership roles during these times. Clear boundaries and skilful teaching strategies support children to develop independence, confidence and competence as learners who have a strong sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Children benefit from mixed-age group settings that promote meaningful relationships and also support siblings to settle. Infants and toddlers are well supported by primary caregivers. There are comfortable, safe spaces to cater for children who are not yet mobile and for those who are crawling and learning to walk. Children up to the age of two benefit from a relaxed pace and peaceful environment that allows them freedom and time to explore. They are respected, and confident that teachers will tend to their needs.</p>
<p>Teachers are skilled in building strong relationships with the parents, promoting a sense of authentic partnership. Each week parents meet with teachers to share information about their children's wellbeing and education. Staff work with a range of services to provide individualised support for children. Teachers work well as a team, are respectful of children and parents and make good use of interpreters to minimise disruption for children and to communicate with parents. The parents who spoke with ERO appreciate these positive relationships. Teachers manage these processes well to prioritise children's wellbeing and support their learning and sense of belonging.</p>
<p>The curriculum is highly responsive to children's cultures, languages and identities. Children are well supported to achieve success through culturally relevant experiences. Teachers plan using children's interests and strengths. The physical environment and wall displays support learning with a range of good quality resources for children to explore. Well defined areas of play encourage children to participate in the activities teachers provide.</p>
<p>Internal evaluation is focused on improving the programme and environment for children. Teachers complete an evaluation at the end of each six-week programme when the children and families leave the service. The head teacher agrees that a next step is to strengthen the team's documentation of evidence-based evaluative practice.</p>
<p>Programmes clearly reflect the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand. MƒÅori values underpin teachers' practice. The teaching team have developed a shared understanding of these values and their impact on teachers' daily work with families, staff and external support agencies. Teachers foster tuakana/teina relationships that encourage older and younger children to learn from each other and help adults to support each other. Ako teaching and learning concepts are also valued as children interact with each other and adults. It is timely for the team to review the centre's philosophy, so it reflects these good practices.</p>
<p>Highly effective leadership supports a shared vision, focused on high quality early childhood education. The head teacher is growing teachers' capabilities and shared leadership through internal evaluation that is resulting in continued improvements. A new teacher appraisal process meets Education Council requirements. Teachers agree that critical reflection on their practice is helping them to strengthen their ongoing internal evaluation.</p>
<p>Managers are focused on continual improvement to enhance outcomes for children and their families. They support staff in providing high quality programmes. They work collaboratively with the head teacher and staff to develop and implement strategic planning, systems, policies and procedures. Managers agree that governance and management planning, monitoring and internal evaluation could be further aligned.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Managers and centre leaders agree that they should continue to support sustainable improvements through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>evidence-based internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adapting aspects of AUT policies and procedures, and strategic, annual and operations planning, to more specifically reflect the early childhood education context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of AUT Centre for Refugee Education Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of AUT Centre for Refugee Education Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.¬†</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
