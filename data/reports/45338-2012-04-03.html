<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Educarents is a service that provides care for children in home based settings. The service has educators (educarers) who provide care in their own homes and nannies that provide care in the child&rsquo;s home. The service was established in 2010 and this is its first education review.</p>
<p>Children benefit from:</p>
<ul><li>a focus on nurturing relationships that means they are cared for by adults who know them and their families well</li>
<li>a range of interesting play activities and equipment to help encourage their interests and development</li>
<li>regular involvement with their local community and good opportunities to be involved with larger groups of children.</li>
</ul><p>The coordinator has successfully raised educarers' awareness of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Educarers have improved the way they notice and record children&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>As a new service, managers have been appropriately focused on developing the service&rsquo;s operational framework such as policies and procedures. They are strongly committed to providing support for parenting and regularly fund informative training evenings for parents and educarers.</p>
<p>Managers now need to focus more on identifying how well the service supports children&rsquo;s learning. This includes:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing the philosophy to ensure it is more specific about outcomes for children</li>
<li>supporting educarers to recognise and plan for children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>making better use of self review to identify how well programmes and educarers' practices are supporting children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>While managers have developed a useful framework of policies and procedures to support health and safety, ERO noticed these were not always being consistently applied. Managers should review their systems to better monitor the implementation of policies and procedures, earthquake hazards, and nappy changing practices. Since the on-site stage of the review, managers have developed clearer guidelines around these aspects.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. The Focus of the Review</h2>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The service philosophy has a strong emphasis on family, valuing children and making links with the local community. Children&rsquo;s relationships with familiar adults are seen as important to providing consistent care. ERO visited a sample of four homes as part of this review.</p>
<h4>Areas of good performance</h4>
<p>Managers provide children and their families with care options that are based on warm and nurturing relationships. They access good quality professional development for educarers and families to support them in their roles. Educarers know the children and their families well and respond appropriately to their needs and expectations.</p>
<p>Managers provide effective support to educarers through regular contact, practical feedback and guidance. Managers have given educarers a useful framework of policies and forms to help guide their practice. They use a range of effective ways to communicate and share information with, and seek information from, educarers and parents.</p>
<p>Children benefit from home environments that are well resourced and have adequate space for a range of play activities. Educarers make good use of additional equipment supplied by managers to encourage children&rsquo;s interests and development.</p>
<p>Educarers regularly make use of the local community and events to extend children&rsquo;s experiences and provide them with a wide range of social interactions.</p>
<p>Recent initiatives have improved the way educarers notice and record children&rsquo;s interests and play choices. The coordinator has successfully promoted educarers' awareness of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. She is using a range of effective strategies to help each educarer record children&rsquo;s learning better.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>As a newer service, managers have been appropriately focused on developing the service&rsquo;s operations framework. It is now timely to place more emphasis on how the service supports children&rsquo;s learning. This includes:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing the service philosophy, policies and procedures to ensure they are specific about outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>supporting educarers' practices in recognising children&rsquo;s learning to extend children&rsquo;s ideas, thinking and development.</li>
</ul><p>Managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that self-review practices need to be strengthened. They should now:</p>
<ul><li>carefully monitor how well policies are put into practice</li>
<li>develop a more useful approach for regular in-depth curriculum review</li>
<li>ensure self review clearly identifies outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management and staff of Educarents completed an ERO Home-Based Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s discussions with managers highlighted that they have yet to develop a shared understanding about the service's approach to some aspects of health and safety. For example, they had no common expectations around securing earthquake risks such as microwaves and televisions or where nappies should be changed and on what surfaces. Since the onsite stage of the review managers have developed clearer guidelines around these aspects.</p>
<p>Some policies were not being followed by all educarers. This included storage of medicines and how often sleeping children are checked. It was not clear from some records for administering medication that the parent had given permission and also signed to acknowledge medication had been given.</p>
