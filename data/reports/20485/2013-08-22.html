</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tots Corner in Northcote is a well established early childhood centre that offers education and care for children from birth to school age. In 2012 the centre was relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports that affirm the provision of effective leadership and high quality programmes for children. These characteristics continue to define the centre.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is reflected in the programme, through an education model from northern Italy that is complementary to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Professional development has resulted in teachers promoting education as a process that is collaborative and recognises children, parents and whƒÅnau as valuable partners.</p><p>A commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident in the programme. Success for MƒÅori and Pacific children is acknowledged through respectful and sensitive partnerships with whƒÅnau and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in the centre programme. Purposeful learning experiences and good use of resources support them to develop as confident and competent learners. Children can sustain their interests for long periods as they play either independently or with other children. They initiate their own learning and teachers support children‚Äôs play well.</p><p>Well resourced learning areas encourage children to explore the environment, and promote their curiosity and theorising about the world they live in. Good use of space allows children to extend and develop their imaginative play and experiences.</p><p>Partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau are valued and acknowledged by teachers and the manager. The knowledge, skill and expertise that whƒÅnau MƒÅori and other cultural groups bring to the service is respected and appreciated. Teachers‚Äô knowledge of waiata and karakia helps to extend children‚Äôs thinking and fosters their understanding of New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage.</p><p>Children‚Äôs interests are supported through books, internet-based resources, and by asking local community specialists, families, tangata whenua and tangata Pasifika to contribute to the learning programme.</p><p>Managers and teachers use self review to reflect on their practice and recognise the value of children learning through play. They regularly discuss and review the impact of curriculum decisions on infants, toddlers and young children. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> is used as a basis for evaluating the programme to promote ongoing enrichment of children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>Managers implement highly effective planning systems, policies and procedures that are regularly reviewed for their effectiveness. This systematic self review has lead to improved outcomes for children. Centre staff have a good understanding of the dual purpose of self review, leading to improvement and accountability. Professional development is budgeted generously for and collaborative leadership provides opportunities for all teachers to become effective practitioners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, leaders and ERO agree that a key next step is to continue to strengthen the bicultural focus across all aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tots Corner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tots Corner will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>22 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
