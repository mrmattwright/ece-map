</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pioneers Elm Row is one of four centres under the Dunedin Community Childcare Association, trading as Pioneers. Pioneers is a not for profit organisation and has four centres and three home-based care networks. A governance board oversees the work of Pioneers. A director acts as the operational manager and leader of learning. Pioneers aims to ‚Äòprovide accessible, affordable and flexible quality education and care for families of Dunedin‚Äô.</p><p>Pioneers Elm Row (Elm Row) is a full-day service in central Dunedin. Children from birth-to-school age attend the centre and learn in a mixed-age setting. The centre has recently had major improvements to the indoor environment. The centre provides healthy food for the children.</p><p>Elm Row has a head teacher and assistant curriculum leader. The head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day management of the centre. Since the 2015 ERO review, there has been little change in staffing. All teachers are qualified early childhood educators/teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that the centre will be a 'safe, fun and exciting place'. It also refers to providing a purposeful, rich and inclusive learning environment, recognising each child‚Äôs uniqueness, valuing New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage, and respecting and involving families.</p><p>The review was part of a cluster of four early learning services reviewed in the Pioneers (DCCA) organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Elm Row is welcoming to all children and their parents and whƒÅnau. Relationships between teachers and children are responsive, caring and respectful. Children have a strong sense of belonging and settle quickly into well-known routines. They are empowered to have ownership of and make choices about their learning.</p><p>The family-like, mixed-aged setting provides a positive and supportive learning environment. Children experience tuakana-teina relationships where older children nurture and include younger children in their play. They enjoy learning (ako), through meaningful conversations with teachers.</p><p>Children are well supported in their learning. Leaders and teachers, particularly key teachers (the primary caregiver), know their children well as individuals and learners and communicate closely with their families. Children with additional learning needs are very well supported.</p><p>Teachers have improved planning and assessments for individual children and groups. This is guided by a useful template. In better examples of assessment and planning, links were made to parents‚Äô aspirations and significant learning moments were recorded.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for. Key teachers have very close and nurturing relationships with their children and carefully align care routines with home and the wishes of parents. Teachers intentionally support children‚Äôs learning, including the development of gross motor skills and oral language.</p><p>Strong aspects of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>growing children‚Äôs social competence which is very deliberate and strongly linked to group planning</li>
<li>providing opportunities for children to be physically challenged</li>
<li>giving children many opportunities to explore dramatic and imaginative play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers and leaders have a positive and collegial staff culture with a strong focus on what is best for children. They work collaboratively and are highly responsive to children‚Äôs needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that leaders and teachers need to continue to embed their new assessment, planning and evaluation practices. This includes making children‚Äôs cultures more visible, being more specific about the intended learning outcomes in group plans, and strengthening the evaluation of group and individual planning to know how effective teachers‚Äô strategies have been.</p><p>Leaders and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>refine the centre‚Äôs philosophy and clarify key priorities for children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>strengthen how children‚Äôs cultures are included and valued in the day-to-day programme</li>
<li>continue to strengthen their understanding and use of effective internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Pioneers Association - Governance</h3><p>Pioneers has sound governance practices. Board members have a good understanding of their governance role, and have relevant skills and work experience. With the director, centre leaders and teachers have developed well-considered strategic goals and useful long and short-term plans. Initiatives and practices across the centres are intentionally aligned to these. Teachers and leaders feel valued and very well supported by director and board.</p><p>The director has implemented useful systems and practices that contribute to the smooth operation of the centres through a period of significant change. Valuable relationships have been built with social and educational organisations beyond the association, with the intent of improving educational provision and children's wellbeing.</p><p>The director and ERO have identified that the next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>implement the new and improved appraisal system, including teaching as inquiry</li>
<li>
<p>extend quality assurance to further identify and share best practices across all centres so that any additional support required is identified</p>
</li>
<li>build links with local iwi and MƒÅori whƒÅnau to enable rich learning about te ao MƒÅori across all centres</li>
<li>support centres to develop more useful annual action plans and improve reporting against these.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pioneers Elm Row completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pioneers Elm Row will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>6 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
