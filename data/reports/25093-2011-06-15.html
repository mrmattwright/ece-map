<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>KidStart Counties Manukau operates a well organised home-based education and care service throughout the greater South Auckland area. Staff and educators share a philosophical belief in the benefits of home-based education and care, and a commitment to providing good quality care and education for children. A comprehensive management framework of Barnardos Kidstart systems, policies and procedures underpins the service. KidStart Counties Manukau is part of a pilot project to develop an integrated service with the Barnardos early learning centre with which it shares a site.</p><p>Educators provide home-based care and education for children from infancy to school-age. Respectful, caring relationships help children to settle quickly and contribute to their sense of wellbeing. Good quality equipment and resources are provided to support children&rsquo;s play, physical comfort and developmental needs. Parents contacted in the course of this review express high levels of satisfaction with the educator and the service provided for their children.</p><p>Educators know children well and respond quickly and positively to their needs. They provide meaningful opportunities for children to engage in a wide range of learning experiences, including excursions to community resources and facilities.</p><p>Visiting teachers visit educators&rsquo; homes regularly to monitor health and safety and make suggestions to enrich learning opportunities for children. KidStart Manukau staff acknowledge that they could continue to support educators to strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation. The management team is aware that some aspects of self review could be further developed to improve the service.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of KidStart Counties Manukau was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by KidStart Counties Manukau to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidStart Counties Manukau.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Educators provide care for a maximum of four children in their own homes at varying times during the week. Visiting teachers with recognised early childhood qualifications provide educators with professional support. <span>Visiting teachers, an administration coordinator and a team leader support 15 caregivers who provide for 52 children and their families.</span></p><p><span>This ERO review of KidStart Counties Manukau is informed by the organisation&rsquo;s documentation, visits to homes selected by KidStart, observations of a playgroup, interviews with educators and KidStart personnel, and written feedback from parents.</span></p><p>KidStart Counties Manukau is part of a pilot project to develop an integrated service with the Barnados early learning centre that accommodates the KidStart Counties Manukau office. Just prior to this ERO review, KidStart Manukau was restructured. A new visiting teacher is soon to be appointed.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p><em>Relationships.</em> Robust systems to match educators with families, and ongoing support from the visiting teacher, contribute to the responsive and respectful relationships between educators, children and their families that were evident in the homes visited by ERO. Educators are positive and affirming with children. Friendly interactions enable parents and educators to share the child&rsquo;s progress and discuss parents&rsquo; goals. Parents report high levels of satisfaction with the service they receive. Children&rsquo;s settled behaviour reflects their sense of security with their caregivers and their familiarity with their surroundings.</p><p><em>Learning environments.</em> Good support for children&rsquo;s learning and development is seen in:</p><ul>
<li>a wide variety of activities for both indoor and outdoor play</li>
<li>good quality, age-appropriate equipment that fosters children&rsquo;s interests and meets their developmental needs</li>
<li>photographs of children at play and samples of their artwork</li>
<li>the use of a Toy Library that educators can use to add variety and challenge.</li>
</ul><p>Educators know the children very well and respond quickly to their feelings and care needs. They maintain good hygiene practices and are supported by visiting teachers&rsquo; regular health and safety checks.</p><p><em>Home based learning.</em> Educators include learning opportunities in planned experiences, day-to-day household activities and excursions. They:</p><ul>
<li>engage children in frequent and sustained conversations and are responsive to infants&rsquo; nonverbal communication</li>
<li>keep good records of the child&rsquo;s day, and note activities that children have enjoyed</li>
<li>compile children&rsquo;s care and learning books, which contain photographs and observations of each child and are highly valued by parents</li>
<li>encourage children to play cooperatively together</li>
<li>foster good reading practices, and encourage some aspects of children&rsquo;s developing literacy and numeracy skills.</li>
</ul><p>Visiting teachers model good early childhood practices and offer ideas and suggestions. Children have established friendships with their peers, are confident with adults, and are eager to learn.</p><p><em>Playgroup.</em> The KidStart Manukau Playgroup is a valued part of the programme for many educators. They use playgroup as an opportunity for children to socialise with a larger group of children and other adults. Children engage enthusiastically in group activities and join in active play in the attractive well equipped outside area. Visiting teachers use playgroup to promote good practices and to introduce children to a wider variety of equipment and experiences. Educators express appreciation for opportunities to network with other caregivers and to learn new skills at the playgroup.</p><p><em>Shared purpose.</em> KidStart Counties Manukau Barnardos staff and the visiting teacher work collaboratively with educators to ensure that children receive good quality homebased care and education. They share a philosophical belief in benefits of home-based care and learning for children and their families. Educators appreciate the support they receive from the visiting teachers and opportunities for initial and ongoing training. The KidStart organisation has many good processes in place for quality assurance, strategic planning and review. Staff reflect on their practice and are committed to ongoing improvements in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Assessment and planning records.</em> KidStart Manukau staff are aware they could support educators to improve aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation. Children&rsquo;s learning and care books would be more useful if they showed how the children&rsquo;s learning and development was progressing over time. Visiting teachers should continue to assist educators to record significant learning experiences that show how the educator identified and responded to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Subsequent planning could be based on extending children&rsquo;s interests and ideas.</p><p><em>Self review.</em> The management team identified areas in which self review could be used to guide further improvements in practice, including:</p><ul>
<li>developing a philosophy that includes the multiple perspectives of parents, educators and staff</li>
<li>involving parents and families in sharing their goals and aspirations for their children</li>
<li>increasing the complexity of learning and enriching children&rsquo;s educational opportunities</li>
<li>sharing of educator good practices.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>Currently, nine children in the service identify as M&#257;ori. The service philosophy and practices are underpinned by the Barnardos M&#257;ori Strategy- Nga Pou E Wha (Four Cornerstones). Staff are encouraged to engage in professional development and to increase their use of bicultural practices.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Relationships.</em> Respectful and supportive relationships with wh&#257;nau are a positive feature of the service. Educators have good communication with wh&#257;nau. Welcoming processes, and daily programmes and routines, are individualised to meet the needs of children and wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Review of policy and practice.</em> KidStart Counties Manukau staff could review how they identify and respond to the aspirations of parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children. They could also consider using Ka Hikitia: Managing for Success -M&#257;ori Education Strategy and other Ministry of Education and ERO resources to support their self review. These developments would assist staff and educators to reflect on their own practices and to increase their use of bicultural practices in their home-based care programmes.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of KidStart Counties Manukau completed an ERO <em>Home-Based Care Management Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the service arranger agreed that self review should be further developed and could include the multiple perspectives of parents, educators and staff.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidstart-counties-manukau" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of KidStart Counties Manukau</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report onKidStart Counties Manukau operates a well organised home-based education and care service throughout the greater South Auckland area. Staff and educators share a philosophical belief in the benefits of home-based education and care, and a commitment to providing good quality care and education for children. A comprehensive management framework of Barnardos Kidstart systems, policies and procedures underpins the service. KidStart Counties Manukau is part of a pilot project to develop an integrated service with the Barnardos early learning centre with which it shares a site.</p><p>Educators provide home-based care and education for children from infancy to school-age. Respectful, caring relationships help children to settle quickly and contribute to their sense of wellbeing. Good quality equipment and resources are provided to support children&rsquo;s play, physical comfort and developmental needs. Parents contacted in the course of this review express high levels of satisfaction with the educator and the service provided for their children.</p><p>Educators know children well and respond quickly and positively to their needs. They provide meaningful opportunities for children to engage in a wide range of learning experiences, including excursions to community resources and facilities.</p><p>Visiting teachers visit educators&rsquo; homes regularly to monitor health and safety and make suggestions to enrich learning opportunities for children. KidStart Manukau staff acknowledge that they could continue to support educators to strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation. The management team is aware that some aspects of self review could be further developed to improve the service.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
