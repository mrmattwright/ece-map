</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangere Bridge Playcentre is a well established centre which operates as a parent-led cooperative and is part of the Auckland Playcentre Association. The centre opens for three half days a week. The children may attend one session per week without their parent or caregiver, as they prepare to transition to school.</p><p>The centre has a strong history of positive ERO reviews. This report affirms that good practices have been maintained. Centre members focus on improvement and have worked diligently to ensure that areas for improvement and progress in the last ERO report were addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy of parents as first teachers is clearly evident. Centre members work together to ensure the Association‚Äôs and the centre‚Äôs vision and strategic goals are met. A "buddy" system is used as a way of giving support to new members by those who are more experienced.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children know other children and adults well and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They are increasingly self-directed and capable learners. There is some good modelling of parents/whƒÅnau engaging with children in play and in conversations that extend children‚Äôs thinking.</p><p>Tuakana/teina relationships between older children and younger children are a key feature. Infants and toddlers are well cared for. Their care is shared by kind and sensitive adults. Centre members work well together to set up interesting learning environments that support children‚Äôs play and learning. Resources are accessible to children and their achievement and milestones are celebrated by all parents/whƒÅnau.</p><p>Good quality processes for programme planning and assessment are in place to help provide a responsive programme for children. Centre members use a variety of communication methods to inform each other of upcoming events and to plan for children‚Äôs learning programmes. MƒÅori and Pacific children have a strong sense of identity. Bicultural practices are genuine. All cultures are respectfully recognised and celebrated in the programme</p><p>Good quality interactions and rich dialogue support language acquisition for all children. Adults are consistent in their approach to promoting and providing strategies to support the development of children‚Äôs interpersonal skills, particularly in relation to conflict resolution. Adults take shared responsibility for supporting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed by centre members. The Association has good systems in place to support members in implementing and promoting Playcentre values and beliefs as well as centre and Association strategic directions. Strong respectful leadership is valued and is embedded in practice. Good quality practices build centre members‚Äô capacity and shared understandings and help ensure the sustainability of good practices in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that key next steps for further improving centre performance are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build training levels of members</li>
<li>continuing to foster and develop leadership skills of both adults and children</li>
<li>formally documenting children‚Äôs assessments in the portfolios to show progress and continuity of their learning and the follow up on their next learning steps</li>
<li>continuing to develop self-review practices that are meaningful to the playcentre context.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangere Bridge Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mangere Bridge Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
