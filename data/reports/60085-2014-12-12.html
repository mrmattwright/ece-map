</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whitby Educare is a privately owned, full day early childhood service catering for 72 children up to school age. The centre operates in partnership with Educare.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is based on the concept of environmental awareness and the centre's involvement in NZ Enviro Schools. The owners have recently developed a wilderness outdoor area and multiple sustainable gardens.</p><p>There has been a change of ownership since the previous review. Prior to 2012 the centre operated under two licences. One was for children aged up to two, and the other for those aged over two. The centre has now merged under one combined licence, although the two groups continue to be physically separated within the building.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs reporting history for the under-two children's service is very good, but the reports for overtwo service have been less positive. This is the first ERO review of the combined centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new owners of Whitby Educare are well supported by Educare managers and have made a number of improvements, in consultation with parents, to better provide a positive learning environment for children.</p><p>Key elements of the collaboratively developed philosophy are evident in practice. The ongoing development of the environment helps the children learn sustainable practices. Relationships between people, places and natural resources are fostered in everyday routines.</p><p>The owners have improved partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. The closer knowledge of the children enables teachers to develop a more child-focused programme.</p><p>The owners have a sound programme review process which has resulted in positive changes to the curriculum. In particular, the centre‚Äôs planning and assessment practices have been refined to better identify children‚Äôs interests, strengths and learning needs. The analysis of the learning informs planning.</p><p>The under-twos‚Äô (Geckos) room has a gentle, calm atmosphere. Teachers sensitively interact with the children. Constant conversations and descriptive praise provide a sound foundation for development.</p><p>In the over-twos‚Äô (Tuataras) room, children actively engage in learning and exploration. The new licence and centre popularity have led to increased numbers of children. The owners need to review the impact of this change and reconsider the organisation and value of group times. Interactions are generally positive, but some teachers do not sufficiently engage children in conversations.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and science learning are well interwoven into the curriculum. Teachers ably introduce mathematics and science concepts into the curriculum through authentic learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô appraisals are robust. The next step is for teachers to have more evidence-based reflection on their practice and receive targeted support to promote their professional growth.</p><p>Appraisals have identified the need for teachers to improve their knowledge and skills in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Educare is planning a full review of the quality and impact of its provision for success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori, and also its bicultural provision. This review is timely.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs useful set of procedures for children moving into, within and to school is evident in practice. Children and parents are well supported in all stages of their early childhood journey and into school.</p><p>The owners have developed good relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. They communicate through a range of media and successfully share children‚Äôs learning digitally.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve learning outcomes for children, centre managers and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate the quality and impact of group times in the Tuatara room</li>
<li>provide professional development to increase teachers‚Äô understanding and use of reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>extend children‚Äôs learning and challenge their thinking and problem-solving skills through effective questioning</li>
<li>grow professional practice through well targeted support.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whitby Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whitby Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>12 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
