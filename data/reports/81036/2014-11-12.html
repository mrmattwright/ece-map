</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Roslyn/Māori Hill Playcentre is open five mornings and one afternoon a week. It has three paid educators. There are over 50 children on the roll, though most attend part-time. The licence allows for up to 25 children, including 13 babies and/or toddlers.</p><p>Two educators and a small group of parents form a supervisors' group. This group leads the daily programme. There is a high parent to child ratio as many other parents choose to stay and help.</p><p>The centre is very welcoming and supportive for families. The educators know the children and their families well. Some parents have been involved with the playcentre for many years. As with all playcentres, parents are expected to engage in playcentre training.</p><p>In response to a 2011 ERO recommendation, the centre has improved its self-review processes. Other 2011 recommendations about strengthening the focus on children’s learning and Māori language and culture continue as areas for review and development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of reviews within the Otago Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly on arrival and confidently approach adults. The centre has a calm atmosphere where children enjoy their play. Routines are well established but flexible around children’s needs and interests.</p><p>Adults take time to listen carefully to the children. They notice and follow the children’s interests and ideas and build on these. There is a sense of fun and humour in the way children and adults interact with each other.</p><p>Children benefit from the way adults in this centre:</p><ul>
<li>extend their oral language and foster a love of books</li>
<li>encourage independence and choice</li>
<li>build social competence</li>
<li>have created a safe and well-resourced area for babies/toddlers.</li>
</ul><p>The centre gathers parents’ ideas about their child’s likes, interests and next steps for learning. Some children’s profiles have useful examples of adults specifically responding to these. This reflects the centre’s present focus on showing threads/links in records of children’s learning.</p><p>ERO is presently investigating how well centres through New Zealand support children’s early mathematical learning. Adults find frequent opportunities to include mathematical language and concepts in children’s play. The next step is to plan more purposefully, record and evaluate this learning.</p><p>A parent council oversees the efficient running of the centre. There are records of regular and well-documented meetings. Specific roles and responsibilities are shared by parents and regularly reported on. The centre has a healthy roll and practical systems to support new parents to contribute in useful ways and feel welcome.</p><p>The centre has well-developed guidelines and resources to support effective self review. Adults recently completed a detailed review of the centre philosophy and bicultural practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Educators need to put a stronger emphasis on children’s learning. Planning practices, daily session and assessment records (learning stories) tend to focus on children’s interests and activities. Adults need to show how they will promote individual, small and large-group learning. This includes regularly evaluating how well planned experiences and resources have supported the intended learning. Spontaneous reviews, especially those related to learning, could be better documented.</p><p>Adults in the centre have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to continue to strengthen Māori language and culture in the centre. This includes purposefully supporting Māori children’s identity as Māori.</p><h3>Governance</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association is facing challenges and uncertainty as the Playcentre Federation and the training it provides undergoes a period of restructuring. During this time the association has made it a priority to focus on the daily operations of the playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>ERO found that the association needs to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the appraisal process for all employed personnel</li>
<li>ensure that association policies provided to the playcentres are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>be more responsive and timely to training needs to enable playcentres to meet licensing and employment requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Each playcentre has the ongoing support of a centre advisor. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>regular visits to provide informal and formal feedback and encouragement</li>
<li>helping parents know what to do to meet the licensing requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Centre advisors should find ways to make best practice common practice across the association, for example through effective self review and planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Roslyn/Māori Hill Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Roslyn/Māori Hill Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>12 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
