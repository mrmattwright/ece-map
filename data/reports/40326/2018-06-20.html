</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creators @ Home - Bay of Plenty is part of a national organisation that owns a range of early learning services. This network is based in Taupo. It provides three models of support; ‚ÄòAt Home‚Äô, where educarers care for children in private homes, ‚ÄòAwhi', for caregivers of children up lifted from their families by Oranga Tamariki, and ‚ÄòAwhi WhƒÅnau', for whƒÅnau caring for the children of family members. Approximately half of the children in this network are supported through the 'Awhi' model. The service receives standard funding from the Ministry of Education and is licensed for up to 80 children from birth to school age. The current roll of 56 includes 32 children of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>Educarers provide education and care programmes in homes. The visiting teacher, provides support, educational oversight and leadership for educators. Regular playgroup sessions for educarers and children are hosted by the visiting teacher. The visiting teacher is a fully qualified and registered early childhood teacher.</p><p>The organisations philosophy aims for children to be provided with loving, respectful, exciting and inviting learning environments that foster their holistic development. Four Pillars guide service operations and practices, they are: love and connection, nature play, the Reggio Emilia learning model and value-based learning.</p><p>This is the first review of this network, previously known as Footsteps. Creators Education Trust, a not for profit organisation purchased Footsteps in September 2015.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The services philosophy, goals and systems effectively promote positive learning outcomes for all children. The shared vision of ‚Äòchildren deserve our very best‚Äô and the service‚Äôs philosophy are highly evident in systems and practices at all levels of the organisation. An appropriate range of regularly reviewed policies provide clear guidelines and expectations. These are underpinned by concepts of children‚Äôs rights, equity, social justice, advocacy for children and acknowledgement of MƒÅori as tangata whenua. The strategic intent is focused on improvement includes appropriate plans, actions and resourcing.</p><p>Leaders and the visiting teacher effectively build educarers capability within the service. Relationships at all levels are based on respect, trust and reciprocity. Leaders and the visiting teacher have established a culture in which children and their whƒÅnau come first and are valued and affirmed. They are relentless advocates for quality and accessible in-home education and care for all children. Robust frameworks, processes and practices have been established for self review, professional collaboration, sharing and critique of practice. Leadership builds capability in the service to promote positive outcomes for all children and their whƒÅnau</p><p>The visiting teacher has established productive partnerships with parents, whƒÅnau, educarers and external agencies. These partnerships have been instrumental in removing barriers to a child‚Äôs full acceptance, participation and learning. Recent professional learning and development has focused on respectful practice for children up to two years of age. This emphasis has reinforced the importance of responsive care and continuity of home practices and routines for babies.</p><p>Programmes in homes are effectively designed to promote positive outcomes for individual children. The visiting teacher is knowledgeable about current theories and approaches in early childhood education and care. She uses this knowledge well to design a broad curriculum with educarers that reflects the service philosophy, values and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Visiting teachers champion learning through play, care for papatuanuku and maximising children‚Äôs learning in homes and the wider community. Children experience authentic opportunities that motivate their curiosity and connect them with people, places and things of significance to them.</p><p>Assessment systems and practices promote children‚Äôs identities as successful learners. This approach reflects their interests, strengths and learning dispositions over time. Assessment information is central to curriculum planning and is shared with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The visiting teacher effectively implements and models practices that promote positive learning outcomes for all children. They provide individualised support, coaching and mentoring that builds educarers knowledge and capability. Regular contact includes in-depth conversations with educarers, to help identify children‚Äôs interests and strategies to deepen children‚Äôs learning and thinking.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Agreed priorities for ongoing internal evaluation for improvement include refinement of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>procedures for appraisal that include targeted planning for professional learning and development for the visiting teacher and educarers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the current focus on the services commitment to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continued development of the Creators @ Home bicultural curriculum and practices that more specifically reflect MƒÅori perspectives, and practices that acknowledge and build on MƒÅori children‚Äôs cultural capital.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, an important consideration for the service is to create opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to the service‚Äôs strategic direction and the development of a localised curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creators @ Home - Bay of Plenty completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Creators @ Home - Bay of Plenty will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
