<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Red Beach Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Red Beach Early Learning Centre is a privately owned centre in Red Beach, Whangaparaoa. The purpose-built facility is attached to the licensee&rsquo;s home. The centre provides all day education and care for up to 20 children over the age of two years.</p><p>The licensee has owned and managed the centre for fifteen years. All teachers are qualified and experienced early childhood educators. Most are long-serving centre staff. Teachers work effectively in a very collaborative approach. The licensee and head teacher provide high quality professional leadership and promote shared leadership opportunities.</p><p>The centre has an inclusive, family-oriented culture. Staff maintain strong relationships and effective communication with families. Parents speak very highly of the education and care provided for their children. Many families have had a long association with the centre.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. Managers and staff have responded positively to recommendations from the 2010 ERO review.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teaching and learning practices very effectively promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers demonstrate warm responsive interactions with children. They use high quality questioning to encourage higher order thinking and to facilitate complex play. They enhance opportunities for problem solving, imaginative and creative play. Children are well supported to develop independence, self management and social skills.</p><p>Children are articulate, capable and confident learners. They co-operate well and friendships are strongly evident. Children are offered choices and show initiative and engagement in leading their own learning. The learning environment is well resourced and organised, and reflective of children&rsquo;s interests. Children are encouraged to care for the environment and to take responsibility in centre routines.</p><p>Learning programmes are based on children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Teachers use a &lsquo;notice, recognise and respond&rsquo; model. This incorporates individual and group interests, which are regularly updated and evaluated. Planned learning is very visible in centre displays and is reflected in practice. High quality portfolios provide good information on children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Staff could consider ways to more clearly identify possible next steps for children and show how these were responded to. Teachers have recently participated in professional learning and development to extend their focus on children&rsquo;s individual interests, needs and potential.</p><p>Teachers carry out regular review of the centre&rsquo;s curriculum to ensure that it meets the needs of their children and families. They promote age appropriate programmes within the centre. Transition to school is well considered. Teachers incorporate early literacy and numeracy learning effectively in meaningful ways.</p><p>Staff have continued to progress the development of a centre curriculum that reflects New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural environment. Professional development for all staff is ongoing. Managers are making very good use of community resources and networks. Lead teachers who are knowledgeable in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori provide good support to build the capability of all staff. Celebrations and protocols are being introduced into the centre culture in authentic ways. Staff should continue to strengthen these good practices.</p><p>There is a culture of improvement in the centre. Managers and staff actively seek to extend their practice and knowledge. Professional learning and development is purposeful and well considered. Managers have redesigned staff appraisal processes and continue to refine current appraisal approaches.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report noted that reflective and collaborative self review practices were in place to guide centre practice. The centre has continued to build on those practices with support from external professional development. Effective self-review processes are now embedded, which managers are continuing to develop. The centre philosophy is regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with practice and with the aspirations and needs of the community. An up to date and regularly reviewed policy framework guides centre operations.</p><p>Strategic planning is an area of progress in response to the 2010 ERO review. Clearly documented long term and annual plans provide a vision and goals for the centre and a record of actions and progress. Strategic planning is informed by self review and input from staff and parents. Effective self review and strategic planning processes support the service&rsquo;s capacity to sustain quality and to continue to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre staff have identified, and ERO agree, that key next steps to extend existing good practice should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to refine some centre systems, including staff appraisals and documentation of children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>continuing to develop and make more visible New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage and te ao M&#257;ori</li>
<li>continuing development of information communication technologies (ICT) to enhance collaborative decision-making, communication, and children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Red Beach Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
