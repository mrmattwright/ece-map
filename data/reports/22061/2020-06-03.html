</table><p>Mt Wellington Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mt Wellington Playcentre is a well-established family cooperative that operates under the umbrella of the Playcentre Aotearoa, Auckland Regional Hub (ARH). There are three morning sessions per week, and two afternoon SPACE sessions for infants and their parents, many of whom later become Playcentre members. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including 20 up to the age of two years.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy of <span lang="mi">'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi',</span> adults and children learning together, continues to underpin the culture of the centre. Parents and whƒÅnau are valued as being the best educators of their children. Sessions are guided by <span lang="mi"><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></span>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></p><p>Since the 2016 ERO review there have been many changes in membership. An increase in membership has been supported by the introduction of an initiative known as <span lang="mi">'Atawhai',</span> which allows members with children under two to attend once a week, rather than the traditional minimum of twice a week.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted that children engaged in meaningful play with a high level of social interaction. These features continue to be evident. Centre members have responded positively to next steps recommended by ERO in programme planning and implementation.</p><p>The new structure of Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> is now fully operational and a review of this new structure is currently underway. The organisation provides a sound management framework as well as support personnel to assist centre members in managing their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres‚Äô funding and provides an adult education programme for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve Playcentre qualifications. Centre members have adopted planned approaches to embracing and implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. A new licensee/contact person is in the process of being appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional Hub.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Playcentre philosophy underpins and guides whƒÅnau and educator practice. Parents/whƒÅnau value the knowledge and skills that others bring, work collaboratively to provide a play-based programme and encourage child-initiated learning.</p><p>Respectful and affirming relationships underpin the high level of support adults have for each other in their dual role in the centre as parents and <span lang="mi">kaiako.</span> This inclusive environment contributes to children developing friendships and a strong sense of belonging. Children are well supported while they transition into Playcentre and then on to school.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau have a strong commitment to bicultural practices and incorporating <span lang="mi">te ao MƒÅori</span> in programmes for children. <span lang="mi">Tuakana/teina</span> relationships are evident in practice. Experienced centre members and regional personnel share their knowledge with new members and encourage them to take on leadership roles. Older children are caring and considerate of the younger children and are confident with adults.</p><p>Centre members have sound assessment and planning processes that reflect Playcentre philosophy and link to <span lang="mi"><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></span>. Children‚Äôs individual assessment portfolios show how their play has developed over time.</p><p>Children have many choices and learn in a well-resourced environment that invites children‚Äôs engagement and sustains their play. They receive good support for their developing language, creativity and knowledge of science. Children explore, try things out and make discoveries. They have fun, share ideas and play cooperatively in groups.</p><p><span lang="mi">Kaiako</span> ensure that the youngest children are well provided for in the programme. Internal evaluation has resulted in the development of an attractive area for infants, with a wide variety of appropriate resources. Centre members encourage toddlers to develop independence and take an active part in the programme. They support each other with the care of each other‚Äôs children.</p><p>The regional management team takes responsibility for supporting effective centre operations. They are aware of the strengths and needs of the centre and provide professional leadership to promote improvement and growth. The centre support worker is guided by the regional centre support coordinator. This support helps the centre to continue to develop quality programmes for children, and sound health and safety monitoring practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for kaiako/centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>make the continuity of children's learning more visible in assessment, planning and evaluation documentation to show individual development over time</li>
<li>continue to deepen the use of <span lang="mi">te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</span> in daily programmes</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of, and strengthen the process for, internal evaluation to support ongoing improvements</li>
<li>increase the rigour of implementing and monitoring health and safety practices.</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional Hub, are to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify new roles and engage service leaders in the implementation of the new structure across Auckland Playcentres</li>
<li>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen internal evaluation at all levels</li>
<li>identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some centres.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mt Wellington Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 June 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
