<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield is open from 8.30am and 2.30 pm on weekdays and has up to 30 children over the age of two years at any one time. It is licensed to take up to 40 children.</p><p>All teachers at the kindergarten are fully registered and early childhood trained.</p><p>This Kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens administered by the Kidsfirst Kindergartens-Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes. They have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p>Since the kindergarten&rsquo;s September 2008 ERO review there has been a significant number of changes in staff and to the roll. Currently the kindergarten is trialling a no fees policy for parents.</p><p>Teachers provide children with experiences that successfully enrich their learning and development. Children display confidence and appropriate levels of independence.</p><p>Particular strengths of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the degree to which children have opportunities to follow their varied range of interests</li>
<li>the opportunities children have, and take, to initiate play</li>
<li>the successful integration of literacy, science and technology into activities</li>
<li>the quality of interactions and relationships between teachers and children</li>
<li>the well-resourced and positive learning-focused environment provided for children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed children happily taking part in a wide variety of purposeful play for prolonged periods.</p><p>The kindergarten is well managed and led. The head teacher, with the support of current staff, has played a key role in promoting improvements and developing an effective team culture. Teachers work in ways that foster positive working partnerships with parents.</p><p>The next steps for the kindergarten, identified by staff and ERO, include extending some programme planning, assessment and self-review practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s new head teacher and teachers have focused on bringing about improvements to the quality of education and care they provide for children.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h4>Programme</h4><p>Teachers provide a programme that successfully enriches children&rsquo;s learning and development. Particular features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the degree to which children have opportunities to follow their varied range of interests</li>
<li>the way teachers link activities and children&rsquo;s learning to key aspects ofTe Wh&#257;riki (The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum)</li>
<li>the opportunities children have, and take, to initiate play</li>
<li>the successful integration of literacy, science and technology.</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed children happily and purposefully taking part in a wide variety of exploratory play for prolonged periods.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their interests well. They have regular conversations with children, parents and among themselves. These discussions, along with observations and the information they gather for attractively presented children&rsquo;s profiles, help teachers to notice and recognise key aspects of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>Teachers are observant, supportive and responsive to children. They regard children as capable, life-long learners. This attitude fosters children&rsquo;s confidence. Teachers give children the time and space they need to learn at their own pace.</p><p>Teachers skilfully support children&rsquo;s play by using a variety of appropriate teaching approaches. For example they:</p><ul>
<li>support children&rsquo;s independent play by making good decisions about when to stand back and when to get more involved with activities</li>
<li>discuss and question in ways that often extend children&rsquo;s ideas, thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>provide stimulating additional resources to support children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>join in with children&rsquo;s play and model good social skills.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are sensitive and responsive to children&rsquo;s immediate needs. Supportive relationships exist between teachers and children and among children. These relationships, along with predictable routines, foster children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging.</p><h3>Environment</h3><p>Children are provided with a positive learning-focused environment. Strengths of the kindergarten&rsquo;s environment include:</p><ul>
<li>the effective use of the space available</li>
<li>the attractive and informative displays that celebrate children&rsquo;s learning and show helpful links to Te Wh&#257;riki</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s ready access to, and use of, a wide variety of appealing resources</li>
<li>the ongoing improvements to play areas occurring through self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Leadership</h3><p>The kindergarten is well managed and led. The head teacher, with the support of staff, has played a key role in promoting improvement and developing a positive team culture. He has responded well to staff changes and emerging situations. Increasingly reflective practices, and openness to new ideas among teachers, support informed decision making and innovation.</p><h3>Partnership building and responsiveness</h3><p>Teachers actively promote positive working partnerships with parents. They take the time necessary to create in-depth relationships and seek information about children and their families. Teachers look for opportunities to include parents in the programme and mix socially. Special events celebrating children&rsquo;s learning are well attended by parents and families.</p><p>In an effort to boost the roll and be responsive to children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; needs, the kindergarten, with the support of its association, is trialling a no fees policy. This trial has resulted in more children being involved with the kindergarten and improved attendance.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Extending programme planning, assessment and evaluation</h4><p>Kindergarten personnel and ERO agree that it is timely to further develop some practices. Programme planning should be extended to include more specific details about intended outcomes and teaching practices. Children&rsquo;s profile assessments would be enhanced by including more parent and children&rsquo;s ideas to show children&rsquo;s progress more clearly.</p><h4>Refining self review</h4><p>The quality and usefulness of the kindergarten&rsquo;s self-review programme and practices should be enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the emphasis placed on reviewing the quality of teaching and learning</li>
<li>making wider use of success criteria to focus reviews</li>
<li>extending opportunities for parents and children to contribute to review</li>
<li>making wider use of the strategies recently introduced for spontaneous reviews.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>11 June 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-broomfield" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Broomfield is open from 8.30am and 2.30 pm on weekdays and has up to 30 children over the age of two years at any one time. It is licensed to take up to 40 children.</p><p>All teachers at the kindergarten are fully registered and early childhood trained.</p><p>This Kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens administered by the Kidsfirst Kindergartens-Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes. They have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p>Since the kindergarten&rsquo;s September 2008 ERO review there has been a significant number of changes in staff and to the roll. Currently the kindergarten is trialling a no fees policy for parents.</p><p>Teachers provide children with experiences that successfully enrich their learning and development. Children display confidence and appropriate levels of independence.</p><p>Particular strengths of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the degree to which children have opportunities to follow their varied range of interests</li>
<li>the opportunities children have, and take, to initiate play</li>
<li>the successful integration of literacy, science and technology into activities</li>
<li>the quality of interactions and relationships between teachers and children</li>
<li>the well-resourced and positive learning-focused environment provided for children.</li>
<li>ERO observed children happily taking part in a wide variety of purposeful play for prolonged periods.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten is well managed and led. The head teacher, with the support of current staff, has played a key role in promoting improvements and developing an effective team culture. Teachers work in ways that foster positive working partnerships with parents.</p><p>The next steps for the kindergarten, identified by staff and ERO, include extending some programme planning, assessment and self-review practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
