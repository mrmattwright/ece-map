</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Richmond Infant and Toddler Centre is a small privately owned centre. The centre provides full-day education and care in a home-like setting for up to 21 children. It was initially opened as an Infant and Toddler centre. Since then it has diversified to include children up to the age of five years. The owner manages the centre and there is a head teacher who is in charge of the day-to-day operation. This is one of two centres owned by the manager. This is the centre's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers at Richmond place a high value on building respectful relationships with children and their families. A sense of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga is evident. A particular feature of this centre is the care and thought put into children's transition into the centre. Each child has a chosen kaitiaki who mirrors that child's hours and home routines, particularly when settling into the centre. Teachers know the children well, monitor their development closely and celebrate their achievements.</p><p>Children are familiar with the centre‚Äôs well-established daily routines and expectations for behaviour. Teachers have had a focus on children learning to play well together. The children are confident and cooperate in their play, interacting positively with one another. Children have many opportunities to explore and learn in the interesting and challenging outdoor area. Here they learn about nature and develop their physical skills.</p><p>The teachers working with the infants are knowledgeable and skilful. These kaitiaki thoughtfully provide the time and space for infants to develop physically at their own pace in a mixed-age setting. Teachers have respectful, caring and nurturing relationships with infants and sensitively respond to their subtle verbal and non-verbal cues. Teachers know the children well and work closely with parents, valuing their contribution and preferences.</p><p>Children experience some tikanga MƒÅori, waiata, karakia and te reo MƒÅori in the daily programme. Teachers are committed to furthering their knowledge and confidence with things MƒÅori.</p><p>The children‚Äôs individual profile books are a record of their time at the centre and show that teachers make effective use of the teachable moment. The newly introduced assessment, planning and evaluation process is still at the early stages of development and implementation. Once the process is embedded, leaders will need to ensure there is consistent quality in the documentation and that stories clearly show the teachers' role in supporting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Other developments that are a work in progress include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making the centre's desired outcomes for children‚Äôs learning more visible in the centre's philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adjustments to the learning programme to better respond to the changing needs of individuals and groups of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring there is greater choice in resources to support the learning and interests of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The manager and head teacher meet regularly and work collaboratively to manage the centre and to plan future developments. They have established some useful systems that support the centre's development. These include a strategic plan, job descriptions, an appraisal system and regular review of centre policies and procedures.</p><p>The leaders acknowledge that some of the newly implemented systems and processes, such as the planning, assessment and evaluation system and the appraisal process, need to be embedded. Self-review processes also need to be further developed.</p><p>Both leaders have been involved in professional development to support them in their roles. They have also participated in workshops to build their understanding of internal evaluation. Since then there have been a number of spontaneous reviews that have contributed to building teaching practice.</p><p>The next steps in developing the quality of internal evaluation are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>complete planned reviews of key aspects of teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the impact of any changes on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a schedule for review that ensures key aspects of the service are reviewed regularly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use policies, procedures, guidelines and best practice indicators when evaluating practice to ensure alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps include the further development and implementation of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, programme planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation/self-review processes and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It will be important to ensure the head teacher has support from the manager to maintain the focus on improving the quality of education and care.</p><p>ERO recommends that an action plan is developed, outlining how the leaders will carry out these key next steps and that the action plan is sent to ERO.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Richmond Infant and Toddler Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Richmond Infant and Toddler Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
