</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunnynook Community Creche has provided education and care for children on Auckland‚Äôs North Shore for the past 22 years. The cr√®che is governed by a management committee which reports to a Community Board. It operates on a sessional basis with children attending either morning or afternoon sessions. Almost 100 children attend one of the available three-hour sessions. The centre is open during school terms.</p><p>A supervisor has responsibility for the daily management of the centre. She leads a team of five teachers, many of whom have been appointed in the last year. All full-time teachers are qualified and registered. There is one part-time teacher who holds early-childhood education qualifications.</p><p>In 2012 ERO identified many positive features, including a well developed culture of planning and self review and an environment that supports a wide variety of learning experiences for children. ERO recommended teachers should extend play opportunities to challenge children and develop greater consistency of teaching practices. The centre has responded positively to these areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a settled and nurturing environment. They are very well supported to settle into the programme at their own pace. Children are encouraged to make choices about their play and the resources that interest them. They are relaxed and confident to try new experiences. Indoor and outdoor environments invite exploration and promote children‚Äôs independent learning.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is highly evident in the programme. Teachers work very skilfully alongside children. Their gentle and respectful approaches support children‚Äôs wellbeing and participation in the programme. Teachers use open-ended questions to extend children‚Äôs experiences. They respond to younger children‚Äôs non-verbal language and are highly responsive to their individual needs. Teachers have identified the need to focus on including more bicultural practices and increasing the use of te reo MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>As a new team, teachers are committed to developing a shared team culture. They plan to review the centre philosophy so it reflects the current team‚Äôs priorities. Regular professional development supports teachers to enhance their practice.</p><p>Teachers thoughtfully record children‚Äôs learning in individual portfolios. They agree that next steps to develop planning, assessment and evaluation of the programme should include:</p><ul>
<li>planning how teachers can add value to children‚Äôs knowledge and learning</li>
<li>making links between assessment records to show children‚Äôs progress over time</li>
<li>evaluating the programme to show the impact of teaching practices and curriculum experiences on improved learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>There is a strong sense of community in the centre. Parents spoken to by ERO indicated a high level of satisfaction with the programme and teaching practice. Parents/whƒÅnau have opportunities to provide feedback in surveys and through regular informal conversations. Teachers are responsive to parents‚Äô suggestions for improvement.</p><p>The supervisor is an effective leader who promotes continuous improvement in all areas of centre operations. Some teachers are highly skilled at coaching and guiding colleagues to extend their teaching practice. Self-review systems are well developed and used to make positive changes that benefit children. The teacher appraisal process encourages teachers to reflect on ways to improve their teaching within a supportive team environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The supervisor and ERO agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>improving the quality of assessment and programme evaluation records</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy and strategic plan to reflect the current aspirations of teachers and families</li>
<li>enhancing the teacher appraisal process with reference to the Registered Teachers Criteria and <em>TƒÅtaiako</em>, <em>cultural competencies for teachers of MƒÅori learners</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunnynook Community Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunnynook Community Creche will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
