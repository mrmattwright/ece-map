</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Park Early Education Centre is located in Hamilton East and provides full day education and care for pre-school children aged from three months. The centre is licensed for up to 82 children with a maximum of 25 children up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 94 children were enrolled, of whom 13 are identified as MƒÅori, 10 Chinese, 7 Pacific, and 13 of other ethnic groups. The centre operates in four age group rooms.</p><p>Staffing since the last ERO review has changed with the appointment of a new centre manager and new team leaders. The centre has a high number of qualified teachers, and operates adult-to-child ratios that exceed minimum requirements. The centre has a positive reporting history and has responded well to the areas for review and development identified in the 2012 Education Review.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Early Education Waikato (EEW), which is a limited liability company with charitable status. The strategic direction of EEW is guided by the overarching vision ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. Early Education Waikato has a commitment to providing a quality, sustainable organisation that effectively meets the diverse educational needs of all children attending and provides strong outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Early Education Waikato designs centres with multiple child spaces and large playgrounds that can provide specific equipment, resources and physical and educational challenges to support children‚Äôs learning outcomes and fun.</p><p>Early Education Waikato is managed effectively and efficiently by an experienced leadership and administration team who also manage the Waikato Kindergarten Association. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity.</p><p>The centre benefits from the EEW clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Park Early Education Centre management and teachers provide high-quality and responsive education and care to their children and families. They view children as capable learners and use a wide range of highly effective teaching strategies to promote children‚Äôs learning. Children and their families are welcomed into a positive culture where relationships are respectful and caring. At all age levels children experience sensitive and trusting relationships with teachers, fostering their sense of belonging and well-being.</p><p>Young babies and toddlers enjoy an unhurried, relaxed environment. They benefit from personalised care routines from key teachers who work in close partnership with family/whƒÅnau. Teachers carefully manage children‚Äôs transitions between the four age group areas. They are responsive to individual children‚Äôs readiness to move. A key teacher works closely with the over-two children, promoting their wellbeing and ensuring that family aspirations are reflected in children‚Äôs care and education.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum strongly reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and the socio-cultural approach to teaching and learning. Particular strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>a focus on dispositional learning that promotes life-long learning behaviours, knowledge and skills that can be transferred into future learning contexts</li>
<li>a rich and well-designed environment that entices children to actively investigate, research and work on interest-based projects over time</li>
<li>a well-developed, comprehensive assessment, planning and evaluation system that is effectively used by teachers to develop individual learning experiences for children</li>
<li>partnerships with family/whƒÅnau that have resulted in high levels of engagement in their children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>many opportunities for children to develop their social confidence, be creative, use their imagination and be involved in dramatic and physical play.</li>
</ul><p>Children experience extensive opportunities to be engaged in sustained, enjoyable and complex play and learning.</p><p>MƒÅori children‚Äôs sense of culture and identity is supported by the increasing use of te reo MƒÅori and the inclusion of waiata and karakia. Teachers incorporate MƒÅori language and culture into the learning programme for children. They make strong connections with whƒÅnau and are responsive to parent‚Äôs aspirations for their children. An additional feature of the centre is the highly inclusive practice and the responsiveness to the many other ethnicities and cultures of children and their families.</p><p>Highly effective and professional leadership is being provided by the centre manager and team leaders. They have designed and implemented very effective and well-developed, self-review processes that focus on continual improvement to the quality of the environment, management systems and teaching practice. A shared leadership model is developing and teachers have opportunities to extend their leadership skills in a variety of areas. Parents and children also act as leaders, and the notion of tuakana/teina and ako are very evident in the centre.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have successfully established a collaborative, reflective team culture that is focused on best outcomes for children, families and the community. They work well together, and their strengths and passions are embedded in their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO supports management‚Äôs intention to refine and rationalize centre-wide self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Park Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Park Early Education Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
