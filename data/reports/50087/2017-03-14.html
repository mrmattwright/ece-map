</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lots of Hugs Childcare 2 is a privately owned service, situated in central Palmerston North. It is one of four centres in the Manawatu area owned by Kids World Limited. The service is licensed to provide education and care for up to 52 children, aged from birth to five years. Children up to two years are cared for in their own area of the centre. Of the 61 children enrolled, 20 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Since the April 2014 ERO report, there have been changes in ownership and management. In November 2014, a new owner purchased the centre. A new centre manager was appointed in early 2015. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager and the operational manager is responsible for business operations. Two teachers have full certification, three are provisionally certificated. One educator is in training. The position of development manager was created and an appointment made in July 2016. The development manager provides overall curriculum support for team leaders and teachers in the four centres.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is inspired by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> - the early childhood curriculum and is evident in centre operation.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring improvement. These included: developing and implementing a staff performance process, including appraisal of management and beginning teacher support; strengthening assessment and evaluation of learning; building teachers' understanding of te ao MƒÅori; and strengthening internal evaluation practice. The centre has made good progress in addressing these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Lots of Hugs Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are encouraged to be independent and curious learners. Teachers treat them as competent learners, respecting their decisions and supporting their skill development. Children learn through a selection of relevant and interesting activities. Teachers model expected behaviours and actively support the development of children's oral language and their expression of ideas. There is increasing community involvement in the programme.</p><p>Children play harmoniously alongside each other. A positive tone and warm relationships with adults and between children are evident in both areas of the centre. Infants and toddlers are nurtured and encouraged to explore their surroundings. Established routines and kai time are well used to support their learning.</p><p>Teachers work with external agencies to plan programmes for children with additional needs. These children receive appropriate support and have their progress closely monitored.</p><p>Considerable work had been undertaken to develop bicultural understanding and practices. Teachers have drawn on the strengths of individual teachers to grow understanding and to develop ways to integrate te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori into the curriculum. Local history and important places are used to provide authentic learning experiences and grow cultural understandings. Bicultural practice is identified by the centre as an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Planning practices have been revisited. Teachers set individual goals for learners and plan activities to support each child to reach these goals. Regular interactions between parents and teachers contribute to children's learning and progress. Parents' aspirations contribute to planned goals and these are included in learning stories.</p><p>Profile books are attractively presented and most record progress towards individual goals and capture aspects of learning, developing friendships and participation in the programme. Children's voices are features of learning stories, providing perspectives on their learning. A next step is to consider how to capture group interests and children's spontaneous learning.</p><p>Children are well supported in their transition into and within the centre. Useful summaries from profile books are completed as records of learning. These are shared with the families' selected schools as part of transition. Teachers agree that there is a need to further strengthen their relationship with local schools to further support children and their families, as they move on from the centre.</p><p>Leaders are supportive, collaborative and improvement focused. They involve teachers in decision making and use evidence and feedback well to inform decisions about change. They provide support to teachers, including those provisionally certificated, through ongoing professional development based on centre priorities and teacher needs. A newly implemented appraisal process has the potential to build, improve and support teacher practice. A next step in this process, is to include regular observations of teaching and documented feedback on practice.</p><p>Business and administration procedures are under review. The centre manager's role and responsibilities have been established. The role of the development manager is yet to be fully defined and developed. A next step is to further delineate leadership roles to give more clarity to areas of responsibility within the centre.</p><p>Internal evaluation is useful and responsive to centre priorities. Teachers are focused on improving the quality of care through ongoing, systematic internal evaluation. Regular discussion is leading to shared understanding across the centre. Suitable processes are used. The findings inform decision making and result in improvement. Strategic planning provides a useful framework to guide teaching and learning and centre direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening systems and processes that build leaders‚Äô and teachers‚Äô capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further defining leadership roles to give more clarity to areas of responsibility within the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lots of Hugs Childcare 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lots of Hugs Childcare 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
