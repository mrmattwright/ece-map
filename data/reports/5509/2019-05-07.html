</table><p>Mosgiel Central Kindergarten¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mosgiel Central Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children aged over two years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 43 children. Children participate in half or whole day learning programmes running from 8.30am to 2.30pm. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by four qualified early childhood teachers and three support staff.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy states that children will:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>acknowledge and celebrate the cultural diversity of their learning community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experience the values, traditions and language of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New¬†Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop independence, social competency skills and be leaders in their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has sustained the effective practices noted in ERO's 2015 review and continues to make very good progress with curriculum assessment, planning and evaluation practices, teacher appraisal and internal evaluation systems.</p><p>Mosgiel Central Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens administered by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). A general manager oversees the association, under the governance of a board. Senior teachers provide ongoing professional advice and guidance to each kindergarten on teaching and learning. This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a strong sense of belonging and place in the kindergarten. Children are confident and competent and capably lead their learning. They know what learning suits them best. There are high levels of engagement from all children across all curriculum learning areas.</p><p>Strong, learning-focused partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau are clearly evident. Relationships with children and their whƒÅnau and between adults in the kindergarten environment are reciprocal and responsive. Parent voice is sought regularly and is valued by all teachers.</p><p>The curriculum is broad and interesting. There is strong evidence of increased complexity in children's learning and wellbeing. There is a good balance of child-led and teacher-led teaching and learning opportunities. Children actively seek opportunities to take leadership roles within the kindergarten.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices are well understood and implemented. Teachers regularly discuss and plan for all individuals and groups of children. High levels of intentional teaching practices are evident.</p><p>The needs of diverse learners are well supported and prioritised. There is a well-established culture of social and emotional coaching, by teachers, to support the wellbeing of all children.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is well aligned to core concepts and values of te ao MƒÅori. These are very evident in the programme and teacher practices. Diverse cultural practices are also acknowledged, celebrated and valued.</p><p>Leadership is capable and improvement focused. The learning environment is very well structured and managed. Teachers are unhurried and present in the learning environments. Transitions are well thought out and well managed. There is a strong focus on sustainability across the programme, which is well integrated in a range of curriculum areas such as science and early literacy.</p><p>The DK board has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2015 reviews. The DK‚Äôs mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. The DK has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. The DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps for the DK</h3><p>The Board have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that reporting and monitoring at all levels is evaluative, to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to the DK‚Äôs and kindergartens‚Äô priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that a comprehensive and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps for Mosgiel Central Kindergarten</h3><p>The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next step to further improve outcomes for children is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen their use and understanding of te reo me ona tikanga MƒÅori practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mosgiel Central Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>7 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
