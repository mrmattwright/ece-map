</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Bears Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Centre was established in 2010. It provides care and education for mainly MƒÅori, Kiribati and other Pacific Island children. The centre is located in a renovated building in Manurewa. The centre owners have second centre, Big Bears Education and Care, in Wiri, South Auckland.</p><p>While Little Bears does not have a history of positive ERO reports, recent changes have resulted in the centre being better placed now to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>There have been significant changes in centre leadership and management. The internal appointment of a centre manager and programme manager have strengthened the teaching team. All the teachers are qualified. The newly appointed business manager is experienced and knowledgeable. She oversees the operational and administrative aspects of the centre. An office administrator provides support for centre operations.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs clear philosophy and vision promote children‚Äôs learning and are highly evident in teaching practices. The learning programme for children is now child-focused and child-led.<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is well embedded in the centre‚Äôs programme. Teachers‚Äô professional development and self review have resulted in good quality outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>ERO is satisfied that the areas for further review and development identified in the 2013 ERO report have been addressed adequately. ERO commends the improvements that the leadership and teaching team have achieved in a short time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is well designed to promote positive outcomes for children. It is built on children‚Äôs strengths and interests and has links to current cultural events and community celebrations. Strong relationships with children and their whƒÅnau are a key feature of the centre. As a result, children have a sense of belonging in the centre and settle quickly into the programme.</p><p>Children are active, happy, positive learners. They are confident communicators and are respected to initiate their own learning. Children have a sense of ownership in their place of learning and trust adults to be responsive to their needs and interests.</p><p>The programme and learning environment are culturally rich and celebrate every child‚Äôs unique background. The physical environment is inviting and calm and supports children to learn together and at their own pace. The resources encourage literacy and numeracy learning, are related to children‚Äôs interests, and provide challenges in their learning.</p><p>The babies and toddlers have large, separate indoor and outdoor spaces to explore safely. Easy access between the indoor and outdoor areas encourages children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>Children‚Äôs assessment records demonstrate teachers‚Äô knowledge of learning and of children as learners. Teachers acknowledge and respect the place of MƒÅori in Aotearoa and are committed to a strong bicultural programme. The affirmation of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is an integral part of the centre‚Äôs culture. MƒÅori and Pacific children, and children from diverse ethnicities, experience a programme where their identity, culture and language are an integral part of their learning and development.</p><p>Another strength of the centre is the cultural diversity of the staff and their multi-lingual skills. The staff work well together and show a strong commitment to improving their teaching practice and to supporting each other to learn each others' languages and culture.</p><p>A noteworthy feature of the centre is the authentic partnership between the centre, parents and whƒÅnau. Relationships are respectful and responsive to parents‚Äô aspirations for their children.</p><p>Parents are active participants and contribute to the programme and to their children‚Äôs learning. They appreciate the support of managers and teachers. Parents who spoke to ERO expressed their gratitude for the transportation provided for children to and from the centre. This has increased the attendance of children and improved their participation in early childhood education.</p><p>Centre managers are improvement-focused. They work well together with teachers to promote better learning outcomes for children. Effective professional development and self review have impacted positively on programme quality and have resulted in improvements to centre operations and processes. A strategic decision to share the role of centre manager has given opportunities for teachers to rise to the challenge and responsibility of leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, centre managers and teachers agree that for the centre to sustain good practice they could:</p><ul>
<li>involve parents more in centre operations by consulting with them about the strategic plan and self review</li>
<li>develop a set of indicators to show how the centre‚Äôs philosophy is implemented</li>
<li>include a variety of teachers‚Äô contributions to children‚Äôs assessments</li>
<li>deepen their analysis of learning and extend opportunities for complex learning through stimulating resources and being more spontaneous in their responses to children about their activities.</li>
</ul><p>Managers should also ensure that non-teaching staff are involved in an appraisal process to improve their practice. The owners could consider accessing an external early childhood advisor to appraise and mentor the administration manager in her centre operations role.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Bears Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Bears Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
