</table><p>Akoteu Matavai Sila'i (Matavai Silai Pre School)¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Matavai Sila'i (Matavai Silai Pre School) is a full immersion Tongan centre operating under the umbrella of the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga. The centre was established in 2009 in the grounds of the church complex.</p><p>This infant and toddler centre is licensed for 15 children. It operates alongside the Akoteu Matavai Silai centre for older children. Children of Tongan heritage make up the majority of the roll. The remainder are either MƒÅori or from other Pacific groups.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes Tongan language and culture, and Christian values. Children's learning programmes are based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The unique place of tangata whenua is evident in practice.</p><p>Akoteu Matavai Sila'i is governed by a management committee of church members and staff, as well as parent representatives. A centre manager, with the support of an office administrator, is responsible for daily operations. This akoteu employs two qualified teachers, including a head teacher to oversee daily teaching operations. All teachers are fluent in Tongan and English and are long-serving members of staff.</p><p>The 2015 ERO review was under the centre's former name, Akoteu Tuingapapai O Uesile (Fanau Valevale).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and belonging is affirmed in a learning environment where the Tongan language, culture and identity are valued and promoted. Children's social and emotional development is nurtured through positive, respectful relationships, and strong connections with teachers and their peers.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing and individualised care. They are respected and encouraged to develop independence. Care moments are warm and unhurried. Infants and toddlers are supported to develop social and emotional competence through tuakana/teina relationships. Children experience a well-resourced learning environment that supports their learning.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> that respond to children‚Äôs interests. Children benefit from excursions and aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. Teachers could consider better ways to promote literacy and mathematics as part of children's play.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. They know children and fanau well. Trusting and respectful relationships encourage families to participate in the programme and support children to have a strong sense of belonging. Well-presented portfolios capture children's individual and group learning experiences.</p><p>Centre governance and leadership is supportive of fanau. Tongan values guide the centre's strategic direction. The management committee, leaders and teachers share a strong commitment to the centre's philosophy. Leaders promote working relationships based on trust, respect, and collaboration. Staff have opportunities for professional growth through well targeted external professional development.</p><p>The management committee has prioritised the sustainability of the centre so that it will continue to grow. The committee appreciates the active role of the church to support children and fanau. There is a sound policy framework for centre management. Establishing effective processes for internal evaluation and teacher appraisal would help to guide centre development and improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>referencing <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the centre values, and Tongan language and culture in the philosophy to reflect current practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing professional development that focuses on developing children's learning dispositions, particularly through discovery and creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing long-term and annual plans that are evaluated to monitor progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a teachers' appraisal process aligned to the Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving internal evaluation processes by including indicators of good practice to help teachers measure quality.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Matavai Sila'i (Matavai Silai Pre School) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve management practices, teachers should rationalise policies and clearly distinguish between policy and procedure.</p><p>ERO identified two areas of non-compliance. To address these, managers must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>staff selection and appointment procedures are consistent with the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>, and a system of regular appraisal is implemented</li>
<li>all children‚Äôs workers who have access to children are safety checked every three years in accordance with the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>.<br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em> GMA7.</li>
</ul><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>18 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
