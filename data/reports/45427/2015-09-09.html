</table><p>Selwyn Kids is becoming well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Selwyn Kids Limited commenced operation in April 2015 under new ownership and management. Selwyn Kids purchased the service which was previously operated under the name Selwyn Toddlers Network. The service operates a before and after school care programme from the same premises. It also operates a home-based education and care service licensed under Selwyn Kids Limited. This report covers a review of the kindergarten.</p><p>An additional building now provides the kindergarten with two separate home-like environments to cater for the specific learning needs of children aged 2 to 3%2 years old and 3%2 to 5 years old.</p><p>Staffing has remained stable through these changes. Leaders and teachers have made good progress with strengthening self-review systems and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy places a strong focus on providing a child-centred programme that is well supported by teachers who are responsive to the strengths, interests and capabilities of children. Leaders and teachers use the philosophy as a basis for self review to ensure that their expectations match practice in the service.</p><p>Leaders and teachers foster inclusive and positive relationships to support children's learning and wellbeing. They provide flexible routines and supportive transition processes into the service, between learning areas and on to school.</p><p>Children benefit from a curriculum that makes good use of the principles of Te Whariki, theNew Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, to drive the learning programme. Children are empowered to be confident to express their opinions and be involved in decision making about their learning interests. Literacy, mathematics and the use of a good range of technologies are well integrated into the programme. Teachers actively listen to children and help them to investigate and extend on their ideas and thinking.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be independent and to take responsibility for the environment. There is an appropriate emphasis on children's creativity and enterprise. Regular excursions into the community and parent contributions further enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are developing a bicultural curriculum. They make good use of natural resources and have a strong focus on sustainable practices. The new owners have developed a useful strategic plan that identifies key priorities for the service in the next three years. They recognise strong leadership as a key driver for change and improvement. ERO agrees and encourages the owners to continue to build the leadership capacity and capability of all staff.</p><p>Self review is aligned to the philosophy and is well led and managed. The systematic approach to self review includes good use of research and results in positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing. The support and guidance manager helps teachers to use self review to inform the learning programme and to reflect on teaching practices.</p><p>The owners and leaders continue to place a strong focus on providing professional development (PD) to enhance teaching and learning practices. The curriculum leader effectively leads PD and draws on external support where appropriate. The planning of whole-service professional development fosters a sense of community for all staff and parents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The new owners have identified long-term planning goals. Priority should now be given to:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing and implementing health and safety policies and procedures, and consistent management systems and processes</li>
<li>developing and implementing annual action planning, and evaluating the impact of these actions on meeting the long-term goals</li>
<li>placing a greater emphasis on bicultural perspectives in key governance and management documentation and practices</li>
<li>continuing to improve appraisal to provide a more evidence-based inquiry process to extend teaching practices and leadership skills.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that assessment practices should continue to be strengthened to better reflect the richness of what is happening in the programme. This includes giving prominence to:</p><ul>
<li>children's language, culture and identity</li>
<li>children's learning and parent aspirations</li>
<li>making better use of individual assessment to inform programme planning and children's progress in learning over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Selwyn Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The owners and leaders need to work with staff to collaboratively review, understand and implement health and safety policies, procedures and consistent management systems and processes. [Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, regulation 45]</p><p>The owners and leaders also need to develop systems to ensure that they are able to access any new information about their legal requirements and distribute this information to staff.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Selwyn Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
