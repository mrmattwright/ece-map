</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years Leeds Street in situated in Wellington city. It provides education and care for children from birth to five years of age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, five of the children enrolled identified as MƒÅori and four as Samoan.</p><p>Most teachers are fully qualified and represent a diverse range of cultures. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports two head teachers. At the time of this review, the service is in the process of recruiting a new head teacher.</p><p>The April 2014 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation practice to more effectively show learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consulting with MƒÅori and Pacific families about their cultural aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing ongoing support and guidance for teachers to build effective teaching practice and leadership capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>Early Years Leeds Street is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New¬†Zealand.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four services in BestStart Educare Ltd.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy has recently been reviewed in consultation with the centre's community. This provides a shared direction for the teaching programme. Leaders and teachers have developed useful indicators to support the effective implementation.</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on extending the curriculum, by using surrounding neighbourhood spaces to enable regular opportunities for children to explore the local environment.</p><p>Teachers are warm and responsive to children. They work alongside and encourage them in play. Respectful interactions and sustained group play are evident. Visual and dramatic arts are well supported and promoted in the programme. Teachers should consider ways they can use conversation with children more purposefully to extend their thinking and learning.</p><p>Teachers sensitively respond to infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô needs for strong and secure attachment. They use information from parents and whƒÅnau to support children's care routines, and respect their rights to be informed and consulted about decisions that affect them. Consistently implementing these approaches across the teaching team is a key next step.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is well promoted and evident in the centre. Te reo MƒÅori is used in general conversations with children. A next step is to support teachers to meaningfully use te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in everyday aspects of the centre.</p><p>Building strong relationships with whƒÅnau, parents and families is an ongoing focus. Targeted professional learning and development supports leaders' and teachers' understanding of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children. Developing learning partnerships with parents, whƒÅnau MƒÅori and the Pacific community is a key next step. This should assist the centre to determine what success for them looks like in this context.</p><p>The centre has recently implemented a new group planning and evaluation framework to support teachers to implement the programme that is responsive to children‚Äôs emerging skills, and interests. As this process develops, leaders and teachers should consider ways they can be more specific about planning and evaluating intentional teaching strategies.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to develop a system for individual planning that includes clearly identified intentional teaching strategies to support children‚Äôs progress. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning portfolios show their interests, friendship and participation in the programme. Teachers encourage parents, families and whƒÅnau to share aspirations for their child. The use of an on-line assessment tool for recording and sharing children‚Äôs learning successfully fosters close links between home and centre.</p><p>Leaders are focused on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing, systematic self review. A key next step is for leaders to build teachers' evaluative understanding and capability. This should assist them to better evaluate the impact of their practices on children‚Äôs learning.¬†</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes self reflection, appraiser assessment, and has a developmental focus. Formal observations of practice provide useful information about the quality of teaching. In addition, teachers and leaders are building their capabilities through an inquiry and knowledge-building framework to help improve outcomes for children. BestStart provides opportunities for teachers to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>Professional service managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. This clearly identifies strengths and areas for development. Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly articulated and well understood. A comprehensive policy framework, including procedures and systems, guides the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage teachers to use meaningful conversations with all children to support and enhance their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop shared understandings of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children, and support teachers to actively use te reo MƒÅori across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop teachers' understanding of effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Leeds Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years Leeds Street will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>6 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
