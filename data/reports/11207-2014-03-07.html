</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kerikeri Community Childcare Trust is a non-profit childcare centre in Kerikeri, Northland, which caters for children from the local community. It is licensed for 40 children, including up to 12 children under two years of age. The environment includes an attractive outdoor play area and a large room that is divided into inviting learning spaces with separate areas for babies and toddlers.</p><p>The two trustees of the organisation have a long association with the centre. One trustee manages financial and governance responsibilities and the other trustee, who was appointed as head teacher in 2012, has leadership and management responsibilities.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and learning. Teachers strive to provide an environment in which each child is able to reach his or her potential. The centre‚Äôs philosophy acknowledges the importance of a bicultural curriculum and partnership with families. Close relationships have been built with families over time.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs 2010 ERO report noted the good care and learning opportunities provided for children. ERO commended the extensive re-development of the outdoor environment and the rich opportunities it provided for children‚Äôs exploration and play. It also noted the inclusive relationships between children and teachers‚Äô and the responsive interactions with babies. These good practices continue to be evident.</p><p>Two of the 2011 ERO recommendations and areas for development and review have not been effectively addressed. These relate to evaluating the impacts of teaching practice on the centre programme. They also relate to ERO‚Äôs suggestion that management planning be strengthened by documenting and reviewing long-term strategic goals.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has an inclusive family atmosphere and teachers know children and their families well. Teachers demonstrate respect for children‚Äôs thinking and ideas. Their interactions with children promote a programme that is responsive to children‚Äôs preferences and routines.</p><p>The learning environment is resourced to foster children‚Äôs creativity and imagination. Teachers encourage the use of natural materials and encourage children‚Äôs exploration of early science, mathematics and literacy learning. Children enjoy a range of experiences and long periods of uninterrupted play.</p><p>Children form good friendships and show the capacity to play well on their own and with others in small groups. Respectful interactions enable older children to be role models and leaders, and encourage them to care for younger children. Children are supported to explore and engage in their learning and to develop a sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for and enjoy opportunities to explore and experiment through their play. They benefit from positive, sensitive interactions and the calm pace set by teachers. Children up to two years of age have easy access to an environment that offers good social support and is well resourced.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to be creative thinkers, and independent, active learners. They help children develop communication skills. Children enjoy participating in conversations with adults and one another. Teachers promote an awareness and appreciation of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers use positive guidance practices to support children to make choices. Trustees agree it would now be useful to explore ways to provide a greater consistency of practice around how children are empowered to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves and others.</p><p>The centre has been developing processes and systems to inform parents and build relationships with local schools to improve children‚Äôs transition to school. They have developed a transition to school policy and continue to maintain a centre‚Äôs curriculum that reflects <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Centre managers invite local schools to visit the centre to share expectations and practices.</p><p>Assessment records are available to parents and children. These records provide information about children‚Äôs involvement in the programme and relationships in the centre. Opportunities are provided for parents/whƒÅnau to contribute to children‚Äôs learning and development through e-portfolios.</p><p>Trustees support teachers to understand the centre‚Äôs philosophy and approaches to teaching. They could now develop a more in-depth evaluation of centre programmes through a focus on what teachers are learning about children and about the effectiveness of their own teaching practice. This more targeted evaluation should provide more useful information to support continual improvement in teachers‚Äô professional practice.</p><p>Trustees are developing a very good foundation for self review through a variety of approaches. A greater focus on working with evidence from a range of perspectives would strengthen decisionmaking practices and help identify priorities for development. More focus on this aspect of self review would also support trustees in developing the centre‚Äôs strategic vision and annual management plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and trustees discussed the following key next steps to support ongoing centre improvement and agree that centre managers should provide leadership to:</p><ul>
<li>better document the ways in which children‚Äôs interests and parent's aspirations are used to plan programmes</li>
<li>develop a strategic plan aligned with an annual plan to provide direction for centre development</li>
<li>update teacher appraisals so that they support teachers‚Äô professional growth and reflect the criteria for teacher registration.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that trustees access professional development to increase their individual and collective capability as leaders to enhance positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kerikeri Community Childcare Trust completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h4>Actions for compliance</h4><p>During the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to centre operations. To address this issue the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that an effective appraisal process is implemented for all staff.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood and Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kerikeri Community Childcare Trust will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
