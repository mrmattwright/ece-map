</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sylvan House is a well established centre that provides care and education for children up to three years old. Children transition into nearby Lanark House, owned and managed by the same licensee and manager, to continue with their early childhood education.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review two staff members have been promoted to new leadership roles. This leadership structure has resulted in some streamlining of centre management. A new centre manager oversees the two centres‚Äô operations and administration. The supervisor manages daily operations. Her role includes oversight of the curriculum and its delivery and professional mentoring of staff.</p><p>Nearly all of the staff are new to this centre. Most are qualified early childhood teachers and some are training towards an early childhood education qualification.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is aligned with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and acknowledges a strong commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. Aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are included naturally in the programme.</p><p>Little progress has been made in the areas identified for review and development in the 2011 ERO report. This is particularly evident in some areas that can have a significant impact in improving outcomes for children. These areas include teacher appraisal, self review and the provision of suitable resources to challenge and develop children‚Äôs interests, strengths and physical skills.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play happily and have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. MƒÅori children and their families experience an environment that is welcoming. There are visible symbols of MƒÅori culture and teachers use te reo MƒÅori confidently in the programme.</p><p>The free flow of play allows children to move with ease into the outdoors. Children are able to make independent choices about their play. Children‚Äôs self esteem is fostered through positive relationships and interactions with each other and with adults.</p><p>Teachers use children‚Äôs interests and strengths as the starting point for planning how to promote their learning and development. Individual children‚Äôs portfolios provide evidence of their learning experiences. Parents also contribute to their children‚Äôs learning through the informal chats they have with teachers during drop off and pick up times. Some parents involve themselves in the daily programme by sharing their skills and talents.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a separate room for play and explorations. Teachers in this room are affectionate and provide children with experiences that promote their exploration and language development. Teachers would benefit from further professional learning on infant and toddler education to help them build their capacity to design programmes for this particular age group.</p><p>Parents interviewed by ERO express their appreciation of centre staff. They describe staff as genuinely caring and helpful. Parents feel welcomed and are well informed about what is happening for their children. They can approach any staff member for support or further discussions. These approaches help promote centre/whƒÅnau partnerships.</p><p>A key feature of the centre is the large outdoor area. Here, children are able to explore and physically express themselves in creative ways. The older children are helping to develop the outdoor environment to enhance their play. Children have started by planting some small trees and shrubs. It is timely now for the owner to renew some of the tired looking outdoor equipment and replenish both the indoor and outdoor resources. Providing a greater variety of good quality resources would challenge and extend children‚Äôs play.</p><p>In 2013 the centre manager resigned, which was a great loss to this community. The two new leaders have managed this difficult situation well. Through this transition phase they have ensured that administrative systems are current and meet regulatory requirements, and that teachers have access to professional development to improve and support their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager is very reflective about how the centre can continue to improve. Together with the centre supervisor she agrees that next steps for development include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing a good understanding of their respective roles, and developing their individual capacity to carry out these responsibilities</li>
<li>maintaining effective financial systems which include an annual budget that clearly identifies anticipated income and expenditure in order to help ensure that the centre is better resourced</li>
<li>developing strategic and annual plans, formally documenting key actions for meeting the centre‚Äôs goals and addressing ERO‚Äôs recommendations</li>
<li>strengthening self-review processes to more effectively guide centre improvements, teaching practices and strategic directions</li>
<li>developing appraisal processes that support teacher growth and helps qualified teachers to meet the registered teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>To improve programmes for children, teachers should strengthen their assessment and planning and evaluation processes. They should review portfolios so that these become a more useful record of the individual child's learning journey and of teachers' partnerships with whƒÅnau. They could also consider how to build their knowledge about mathematical concepts and strengthen the integration of incidental learning about mathematics into children‚Äôs play.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The owner, centre manager and supervisor should establish a clear organisation and management structure that is built on shared understandings and that contributes to more effective, cohesive and sustainable practices across the two centres.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sylvan House Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sylvan House Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
