</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Ants Childcare is a new service in Waiuku that opened in leased premises in mid-2016. While the centre is licensed for up to 60 children, including a maximum of 15 under two years of age, the owners have chosen to keep the roll to a maximum of 55. The roll includes groups of Māori and Indian children and smaller numbers from other diverse backgrounds. The staff also have diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The owners have worked closely with the centre manager during the establishment phase. Their vision and philosophy have guided the development of centre practices. The philosophy is articulated under the concepts of Nurture, Inspire and Grow (Whāngai, Te Whanake and Te Puawai). The owners have a focus on family, community and a holistic view of the child, and on their role in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Programmes are provided for children in three age-related groups. Each room has its own outdoor area. The centre manager works with three lead teachers and their teaching teams. The centre employs a qualified cook, who provides meals for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau are welcomed as they arrive. Trusting relationships with staff help children to settle quickly into the programme. Teachers' warm and nurturing approaches support children's sense of belonging. Good practices for supporting children with additional learning needs, are underpinned by teachers' care for and knowledge of each child.</p><p>Children select from available resources and use materials flexibly to support their play. They approach adults confidently and there are some very good examples of adults engaging in prolonged, in-depth conversations with older children. These teachers listen carefully, and respond to and support children's ideas. Children's strong interests sometimes result in an ongoing, child-led focus in the programme.</p><p>Managers and staff appreciate support from whānau Māori as they work to increase the visibility and quality of bicultural practices in the centre. An external professional provider has been contracted to support this development. Some teachers are particularly conscious of recognising, valuing and building on children's cultural identity and strengths, and making this practice an integral part of the child's learning portfolio.</p><p>Teachers' records of children's learning often show their very good knowledge of children's individual personalities, dispositions for learning and physical development. They also include a good sense of continuity and progress in learning and make links to the strands and goals of Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum. </p><p>Teaching teams are working with external support to establish consistent, effective approaches to programme planning and evaluation. Children's learning records are available for whānau in an online platform and many value and comment on this information. Individual portfolios contain copies of online records and are readily available so that children in the preschool/Puawai room can easily revisit and discuss prior learning.</p><p>The owners and manager have established a sound framework of policies and procedures and their strategic plan has guided centre development. They have adapted the building to improve facilities and continue to find ways to address challenges with building layout. The owners and manager have identified that a next step is to streamline and increase the rigour of management processes and embed effective practices.</p><p>Their underpinning philosophical beliefs about children's learning and support for whānau are well articulated. Teachers have worked together to develop a shared understanding about their philosophy statements. This work will be a useful basis, alongside other guiding documents, for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of teachers' practices and programmes for children.</p><p>Teachers have begun to use a self-review format for considering changes in their practice. The owners and manager recognise that a good understanding of the process and value of internal evaluation at all levels of centre operations is still to be developed. More robust quality assurance and reporting processes will help to assure the owners not only that the service is meeting its obligations and legal requirements, but also about progress towards strategic goals and useful next steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and manager have identified areas for further development and have been proactive in accessing external support. Next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the depth and rigour of internal evaluation, using indicators of best practice, identifying the extent to which the philosophy is enacted, and focusing on improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>establish effective programme planning and evaluation practices and strengthen whānau involvement in children's assessment</li>
<li>increase children's independent access to a wider range of resources and equipment to support learning and provide physical challenge</li>
<li>implement teaching strategies that foster children's purposeful engagement in complex play and independent problem solving</li>
<li>establish shared understandings about high quality teaching and learning, and document teaching teams' professional discussions.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Ants Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, the centre manager should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>health and safety practices are consistently implemented as required, including the prompt identification and removal of hazards</li>
<li>processes for the identification and management of risks associated with regular and one-off excursions are robust.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Ants Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>9 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
