</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amazing Place preschool is owned by Bethlehem Early Learning Centres limited and operates under the umbrella of the Christian Education Trust. The indoor environment provides two separate age-group areas, one for babies and toddlers and another for older children up to school age. The Centre is licensed for 48 including up to 12 children under two years of age. The majority of children enrolled are MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of developing strong relationships where children and their families are supported by providing care and education underpinned by Christian values. Teachers endeavour to provide an environment where children learn and develop their individual strengths and interests, become playful, and curious about the world.</p><p>Developments since the 2013 ERO review include the appointment of a Head Teacher, ongoing enhancements and modifications to the learning environment, and a stronger focus on the emergent curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's well-documented philosophy is highly evident in all aspects of centre operations. Children are relaxed and respond positively to the care and attention that teachers show throughout the day. Christian values, together with a sense of responsibility, and respect for others, are special features. Children are well cared for as they confidently explore their environment and develop their knowledge and skills.</p><p>Teachers use a range of positive interactions to motivate, challenge and support children's learning and development. Teachers are skilled at building on children's ideas and extending their vocabulary through sustained and meaningful conversations. Open-ended questioning promotes higher order thinking and risk taking. Teachers are affirming of children's efforts and take every opportunity to build their confidence through regular encouragement and guidance.</p><p>Relationships among teachers, children and their parents/whƒÅnau are characterised by warmth, respect and reciprocity. Teachers place high value on whƒÅnau participation and appreciate what they can contribute to centre life. Special efforts are made to support families who occasionally need assistance to enable their children to take a full part in centre life. A large wall display acknowledges each child's extended family and reinforces the value of whƒÅnau. Children and their families have developed a strong sense of belonging and know that their contributions are valued.</p><p>The inclusion of te reo MƒÅori is a growing feature of the daily programme. MƒÅori music and movement are a regular highlight for children and teachers, as children experience kapa haka, poi and waiata. Teachers' use of te reo MƒÅori is naturally integrated in conversations and in giving directions. Children are developing an appreciation of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre environment is inviting, attractive and well presented. A wide range of well-resourced play areas provides choice and easy access for all age levels. Appropriate steps are taken to ensure children are safe as they explore and use equipment in challenging and interesting ways. The quality learning environment supports children's creative, physical, social and emotional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Individual portfolios are used to document assessment in an ongoing way. While there are some models of effective assessment practice, there is a need to establish a consistent approach and improve the quality of information recorded. This should ensure parents receive detailed and regular information about their child's learning and development.</p><p>The centre has developed, and is applying, a consistent approach to undertaking self review through the use of an effective framework. The process could be enhanced with the inclusion of a greater level of parent/whƒÅnau input. Increasing the involvement of parents in self review would further support the centre's relationships with parents, increase their contributions, and input into decisions about the ongoing development of the service.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amazing Place Preschool (Sunset Road) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amazing Place Preschool (Sunset Road) will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>15 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>
