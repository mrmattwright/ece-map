</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Stars Early Education Centre offers full day education and care for children from six weeks to school age. The roll reflects Northland‚Äôs large MƒÅori population and includes thirty-seven children of MƒÅori descent and six MƒÅori staff. The centre has merged its two licenses into one. It now caters for 65 children, including 20 children under two. It operates from two buildings on the same site to provide for the different age groups. Kowhai Room caters for children up to two years old, and Kauri Room caters for children over two. Children have ready access to separate outdoor areas.</p><p>The centre has undergone major change since Kauri Room‚Äôs 2011 and Kowhai Room‚Äôs 2012 ERO reviews, with changes in ownership, management and leadership. Bright Stars is a privately owned centre with the present owners taking over in September 2013. The owner delegates the management and leadership of the centre to the centre manager, who has a background in early childhood education. Team leaders have responsibility for care routines and the programme provided for the different rooms.</p><p>The centre manager and team leaders have prioritised building a professional team. A centre philosophy has been developed that promotes a focus on nurturing and responding to the child‚Äôs unique identity. Staff encourage the centre philosophy to be achieved in partnership with whƒÅnau in a safe and enjoyable environment.</p><p>The Kowhai Room promotes the RIE (Resources for Infant Educators) method of education. The RIE approach trusts the child to be an explorer and self learner. Methods used by teachers allow the child to be an active participant in care activities. RIE advocates allowing physical development to occur naturally with selected adult intervention.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 and 2012 reports recommended developments to the programme provided for children, the learning environment, and management processes. This 2014 ERO report acknowledges the progress made in these areas and outlines further improvements that would benefit children‚Äôs education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive good quality care. Teachers are attentive to children and provide respectful care routines. There is a focus on supporting children to develop self-help skills. The RIE approach is evident in practice in the Kowhai Room, where children‚Äôs independent movement and development is well supported. Children in the Kauri Room are responding well to teaching strategies that support their growing social understandings and competencies.</p><p>A well managed transition programme supports children as they move from the Kowhai to the Kauri Room. Teachers implement effective practices that enable children with additional learning needs to be well included in the programme.</p><p>Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play. The outdoor environments provide children with a wide range of engaging activities, including physical play and enjoyment of the natural environment. Children of all ages play for sustained periods of time in the outdoor environment. They have good opportunities to use their imagination, solve problems and develop complex play experiences.</p><p>The indoor environment has separate play spaces that support children‚Äôs learning in different areas of the curriculum. Consideration could now be given to how these play areas can provoke greater interest and invite children to explore further in their play. Teachers also need to ensure that learning resources are easily accessible to children so they can make independent choices in their play.</p><p>The quality of teacher interactions with children is variable. There are some good examples of teachers being careful observers, allowing children to direct and make decisions about their own play. These teachers support children‚Äôs interests and facilitate their exploration, language development and engagement in learning.</p><p>The Kowhai Room has established a planning system that is focused on children‚Äôs learning and milestone developments. The planning and assessment of children‚Äôs learning is visible for parents and supports parent engagement in the process. Teachers in the Kauri Room use planning approaches that help teachers to focus on children‚Äôs individual interests and strengths, and to integrate a learning focus into the different areas of play.</p><p>Teachers provide literacy and numeracy learning through play throughout the day for all children. Children over two are grouped for mat times and provided with appropriate activities in relation to their age and developmental stage.</p><p>The centre programme includes initiatives that promote and foster success for MƒÅori children. MƒÅori teachers provide leadership in te Ao MƒÅori. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated into the programme. Children are encouraged to use and share their language with teachers and peers. As a result, the cultural identity of MƒÅori children is affirmed and contributes to their sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre manager and team leaders provide effective professional leadership. A regular appraisal system and professional development programme to support ongoing staff development is now in place.</p><p>Good management systems support good communication and efficient day-to-day operation of the centre. It is timely for the centre manager to now develop a strategic plan that clearly identifies the service‚Äôs priorities and associated goals towards achieving its vision. These goals could be supported by appropriate actions and resources to enable them to be achieved. Self-review practices are becoming established and have a focus on improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps to support ongoing improvements in the centre are for centre leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>develop consistency of good teacher practice across the centre</li>
<li>document the service‚Äôs strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Stars Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Stars Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
