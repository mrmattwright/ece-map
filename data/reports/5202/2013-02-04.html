<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Akoranga Kindergarten is located in the eastern Bay of Plenty town of Kawerau and operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten provides education and care for children from two years to school age, in six-hour sessions on four days a week, with a shorter session on Wednesdays. There are currently 43 children on the roll, and 33 are of M&#257;ori descent.</p><p>The kindergarten receives significant equity funding, which is well used by management to provide additional learning support, enrich the curriculum and support and enable all children to access early childhood education.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2010, a new head teacher has been appointed and teaching staff have continued to develop and refine assessment, planning and evaluation practices. The association provides relevant professional learning and development for staff, and teachers recognise the value of team-focused development of practice.</p><p>All teachers are qualified in early childhood education, and three teachers have been employed in the kindergarten for three years or more. They have a strong empathy with children from diverse backgrounds, and demonstrate a high level of understanding of, and commitment to, the kindergarten&rsquo;s strong M&#257;ori perspective.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s strong working relationship with the association is contributing to its effective operation. A consistently implemented induction process has been instrumental in smoothing the transition for the newly appointed head teacher into the kindergarten. Self review at governance level is well planned and supports an effective process for resource, personnel and property management. The kindergarten&rsquo;s vision is clear, and the close alignment of annual and strategic plans ensures ongoing and focused development.</p><p>The kindergarten association&rsquo;s professional leader continues to work closely with the head teacher as she settles into her new leadership role. Teaching staff, who are well established in the kindergarten, are taking responsibility for leading aspects of their work as part of a shared model for leadership. The teaching team is working collaboratively to develop the annual plan for 2013. Agreed priorities for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance the self-review process, adopting a collective and ongoing approach that is led by the head teacher</li>
<li>review and strengthen assessment practices</li>
<li>align annual planning, self review, professional development and appraisal processes.</li>
</ul><p>Under the considered leadership of the head teacher, the philosophy for learning and teaching has recently been reviewed. Relationships, family wh&#257;nau, holistic wellbeing and te ao M&#257;ori have been affirmed as key principles. Teachers are continuing to design and increasingly implement a play-based curriculum that is responsive to the diverse backgrounds of children, including those with special needs, young children and the large number of children who are of M&#257;ori descent. The programme is flexible, providing many opportunities for parents and wh&#257;nau to be involved and included in their children&rsquo;s education. Teachers now need to give consideration to developing aspects of this curriculum, such as the empowerment of children, contribution and exploration. Strengthening these aspects is likely to extend and build on children&rsquo;s interests, and provide additional challenge and motivation for them as successful learners.</p><p>Teachers place priority on building and sustaining respectful and affirming relationships with children and their families. They interact with children in a warm and caring manner, allowing time and space to settle and engage in the programme. Ongoing review of the learning environment is making resources more accessible for children and enabling them to engage in more sustained play. Teachers model oral language, providing many meaningful opportunities for children to develop and practise their communication skills. Literacy, mathematics, science are carefully woven into the programme, underpinned by a strong and well-understood te ao M&#257;ori focus.</p><p>Clear and well-understood expectations for behaviour have been developed with children. Children are able to happily join in play and learning with and alongside their peers in an inclusive environment for care and education.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Akoranga Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
