</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Riccarton operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart is a large national organisation that owns early childhood education centres across New Zealand. The centre provides full-day education and care for children aged from birth to school age from a diverse multicultural community. The centre is licensed for 99 children, including up to 16 children aged under two.</p><p>The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations. There is a head teacher with responsibility for each of the four separate learning areas. A BestStart business manager (BM) and professional services manager (PSM) visit regularly to support the service. There is a combination of qualified and untrained staff.</p><p>There have been considerable changes in the centre licence, environment and staffing since the 2015 ERO review. The centre licence has increased from 50 to 99 children. Another building has been added to the premises. The centre now operates as four learning areas: a nursery, toddler room, preschool and prep room. The nursery and toddler room have their own outdoor areas. The preschool and prep room share an outdoor space.</p><p>A new centre manager and PSM started at the end of 2017. There have been several teaching staff changes. At the time of this review there were vacancies in some teaching positions.</p><p>These changes have impacted on centre progress in the areas identified for improvement in the last ERO review. As the centre has extended, the centre manager has focused on supporting appropriate staffing and establishing team culture, routines, environments and the curriculum in each room.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have undertaken a useful and in-depth review of the centre's philosophy that has supported their teaching practice. This is helping the new team to develop shared understandings of teaching beliefs and how learning is promoted at the centre, and about how the philosophy is enacted in the classrooms.</p><p>There are good examples of teachers, particularly in the nursery and toddler areas, taking time to find out about children's language, culture and identity. They use this information well to make links with families and show value for children‚Äôs cultures through attractive displays in the environment. Centre practices include the regular use of te reo and some tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers promote practices that support children and their families to feel welcomed and included in the centre. Children's transitions into the centre and between the rooms are reinforced by well-considered planning, strategies and support.</p><p>Children's interests and learning dispositions are regularly planned for by teachers. Appropriate use is made of individual and group planning to notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs learning. Centre leaders and teachers make good use of the current internal evaluation to reliably identify areas for improvement in assessment, planning, and evaluation practices. They have appropriately identified improvements in these practices as a priority.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers value and promote positive relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. They provide a range of effective ways for parents to participate in the daily programme, spend time at the centre, and contribute their views to decision making.</p><p>Centre leaders are carefully fostering collaboration among the new teaching teams. They provide regular opportunities for teachers to engage in professional discussions, plan together, and interact across the centre. This is helping build whole team approaches to supporting well being and children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Centre leadership has recently become more consistent. The new centre manager and PSM along with the BM have placed necessary emphasis on developing the team culture and building shared understandings of good practice. The centre manager is effectively building teachers' reflective practice. Useful systems are in place to encourage teachers to regularly reflect on aspects of their teaching. Teachers receive helpful feedback to focus them more on the philosophy, curriculum and children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to use internal evaluation to support centre improvement. Regular reviews of the physical spaces are supporting environments to become more conducive to infants', toddlers' and young children's well being and learning.</p><p>The centre manager, business manager and professional services manager are working in partnership to implement BestStart's systems to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>After many staff changes, and significant centre growth, the centre managers are focused on developing the curriculum and successfully enacting the philosophy in each room. Centre managers and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop greater consistency of effective teaching and curriculum implementation across rooms to support continuity of learning for children as they progress through the centre</li>
<li>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation as teachers grow their understanding of Te WhƒÅriki 2017, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>improve all teachers' understanding and use of internal evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen partnerships with local schools and teachers' use of BestStart's own internal indicators for "Be School Ready" to inform curriculum decisions.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Riccarton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Riccarton will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>26 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
