</table><p>Children's Play and Recreation Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children's Play and Recreation Centre is a licensed early childhood service in Dunedin Hospital. Its overall aim is to provide a safe and secure learning environment for children while they are in hospital. The playroom is open to children and parents 24 hours a day.</p><p>Two full time Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) operate the service during the week. Additional staff run the service at the weekends. All staff are registered early childhood teachers. They are experienced in the HPS role and the full time teachers have gained their HPS professional qualifications. The HPS work with children and their families on the wards and in the playroom. They work closely with the health professionals within the hospital. The HPS service is part of the Women's and Children's Health service of Dunedin Hospital, Southern District Health Board and is well supported by the hospital managers.</p><p>The centre has made good progress with most of the next steps identified in the 2016 ERO report. The next steps in this report are progressions of the work achieved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have safe and interesting places to play, relax and spend time with their families during their time in hospital. HPS demonstrate a strong focus on the wellbeing of children and their families. They quickly get to know the children's interests and use these contexts to respond successfully to the different needs.</p><p>HPS establish positive, reciprocal relationships with children's whƒÅnau. Meaningful plans are put in place for individual children to provide for a consistent approach across the HPS team and with parents. Continuity of learning is seen in the plans for children who are in the ward for longer periods of time. Children's languages, cultures and identities are valued and respected.</p><p>The recently developed planning approach centres on each child's wellbeing and interests. HPS then plan the strategies that will best support the intended outcomes. They could better document the impact of these strategies in the evaluation section. Appropriate links are made to the early childhood curriculum, Te WhƒÅriki (2017). Improved planning is effectively guiding HPS practice to better meet the needs of children.</p><p>The HPS are improvement focused. They are in the early stages of using a useful process to guide their internal evaluation for improvement. The strategic plan clearly sets out the development priorities for the centre. ERO's evaluation identifies that short term planning would be useful if it provided more detail of who will complete what actions within a prescribed timeframe.</p><p>Other key factors contributing to positive outcomes for children include the:</p><ul>
<li>collaborative working relationships within the HPS team, and with the multi-disciplinary team and Invercargill HPS</li>
<li>good communication systems within the HPS team and hospital staff to ensure necessary people are aware of expectations and ongoing developments regarding children's needs and progress</li>
<li>strengthened appraisal procedure that allows HPS to be more focused on improving their teaching for better outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers, HPS and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>establish the centre's valued outcomes for children to inform aspects of planning</li>
<li>extend evaluation practices to know about the impact of planning and teaching on outcomes for children (at individual level and the Play Room programme) and use this information to know how well the centre's valued outcomes for children are being achieved</li>
<li>develop short-term planning to show how the strategic goals are to be achieved and how appraisal, professional learning and development, and internal evaluation align to these goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Children's Play and Recreation Centre completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>8 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
