</table><p>Frimley Early Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frimley Early Learning Centre is situated at Hastings. It provides all day education and care for children from birth to school age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, 18 of the children enrolled identified as MƒÅori and two are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The service philosophy focuses on building strong relationships and positive wairua to develop children‚Äôs independence and competence.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review there have been several changes in leadership. The centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre and supports the teaching team. Most teachers are qualified. They represent a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>The February 2016 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included developing and embedding assessment and planning practices and strengthening the evaluative aspect of self review. Good progress has been made to address these areas.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by Provincial Education Group Ltd (the organisation). It provides governance and management support. A substantial management team oversees a number of services nationwide. This includes a professional leader who provides support and guidance to the teaching team. Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the organisation's philosophy and practices.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the indoor and outdoor spaces have undergone significant development to provide additional learning opportunities for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning within a curriculum that is responsive to their interests and developing dispositions. Redeveloped spaces encourage children to explore, engage and have fun in play for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs cues, prompts and questions. They use a range of strategies to develop children‚Äôs problem-solving and social competence. Warm, respectful relationships are modelled throughout the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience a calm and unhurried learning environment. Teachers offer them choices about what is to happen and wait for them to respond. Children are familiar with the routines of the room and demonstrate a sense of belonging.</p><p>Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are evident in the programme. Specific resources and events provide opportunities to experience kaupapa MƒÅori concepts. Some teachers use te reo MƒÅori in general conversations with children. Encouraging greater use of te reo MƒÅori in everyday practice is a key next step. In addition, leaders and teachers should continue to grow their understanding of places of significant value for MƒÅori and celebrate these within the curriculum.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning is currently being strengthened. These improvements should show that teachers are collaboratively developing learning goals with parents and whƒÅnau and more clearly identifying children's learning over time. Teachers are beginning to work with parents and whƒÅnau to build a comprehensive picture of who each child is, their strengths and what they bring to their learning. As this process continues to develop, leaders and teachers should consider how they can:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consistently make children‚Äôs culture, language and identity more visible in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>draw from the aspirations of whƒÅnau MƒÅori and Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them in this context.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have a well-considered approach to support children and their whƒÅnau when transitioning to school. Older children experience a programme aimed at developing self-confidence and competence skills. They have regularly opportunities to experience a school environment.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are beginning to implement a useful internal evaluation framework. This should be strengthened by developing relevant indicators of high-quality practice to support evaluation and decision making.</p><p>Provincial Education Group senior leadership has high expectations for teacher practice. Systems and processes are in place to promote improvements, for the benefit of children and whƒÅnau. Teachers are encouraged to grow their understanding and take on distributed leadership roles.</p><p>A sound appraisal framework is in place that leads teachers to investigate aspects of their practice and make ongoing improvements.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children. A formal reporting process is now being implemented to provide feedback to teachers about the focus of professional leaders' visits.</p><p>Parent surveys have affirmed teacher practice and provided feedback for ongoing consideration. Leaders have been pro-active in responding to the survey findings.</p><p>A recent national initiative, led by the organisation, provides opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to the valued outcomes of the service. The organisation should draw from these national findings to inform their strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>encourage greater use of te reo MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a curriculum reflective of the local context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the internal evaluation framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frimley Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frimley Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>30 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
