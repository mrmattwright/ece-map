</table><p>Ako - Rolleston is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ako - Rolleston is a privately-owned centre that provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children through to school age. It is licenced for 50 children, including 15 under-two year olds.</p><p>The owner is the centre manager. She is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre and is supported by a curriculum leader. Most staff are qualified and certified early childhood teachers. Some staff are training to be early childhood teachers.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made some good progress in addressing the key next steps from the 2015 ERO review report. Teachers' curriculum knowledge has been extended. The effectiveness of the poutama school readiness programme has been evaluated and refocused. Full implementation of a staff appraisal process remains an area for ongoing development.</p><p>The centre is part of the Ngā Peka o Tauwharekākaho (Rolleston) Kāhui Ako | Community of Learning (CoL).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy provides a clear vision and guides centre practices, including a focus on building strong and reciprocal relationships.</p><p>Children are actively involved in an environment where they can choose from a wide range of resources in the indoor and outdoor areas. Teachers provide children with the time they need to make decisions and learn from watching their peers. Children choose from a wide range of resources and the centre is well resourced both inside and outdoors. Interactions between children, parents and teachers are respectful.</p><p>The specific wellbeing and learning needs of infants and toddlers are well met. They experience calm routines, a caring, sensitive, unhurried environment and have easy access to a range of equipment and resources. Teachers are responsive to the individual needs of infants and toddlers and use a range of ways to extend their language learning.</p><p>Teachers successfully follow children's interests and extend their learning through conversations and experiences. They effectively support children to problem-solve during their learning and in their social interactions with each other. Teachers provide a curriculum that is responsive to the individual interests, strengths and capabilities of each child.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are well managed and focused on the needs of children and their families. Child-paced involvement in the programme helps to give the children a sense of responsibility and promotes their independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Teachers work as a collaborative team. They regularly share information about children's learning and development. Centre leaders provide a range of professional learning and development for staff. The centre is yet to fully implement an appropriate appraisal system and attestation process for all teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>consolidate the assessment, planning and evaluation processes and strengthen the focus on learning and teaching</li>
<li>develop strategic plans that clearly identify the centre's priorities, how they will be achieved annually and evaluate the impact on outcomes for children</li>
<li>further refine internal evaluation processes</li>
<li>appraise all teachers and ensure that the appraisal and attestation processes meet all Education Council requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ako - Rolleston completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ako - Rolleston will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>19 March 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
