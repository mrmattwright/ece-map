</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riverton kindergarten is licensed for 30 children aged from 2 years to school age. Up to 20 children attend between 8:30am and 1:30pm for up to five sessions a week. Some families travel long distances for their children to attend.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by Kindergartens South (KS). The kindergarten receives regular support from senior teachers. The kindergarten is led by an experienced head teacher and teachers.</p><p>After the 2014 ERO review senior teachers supported the teachers to develop action planning to address the key next steps for improvement. The head teacher and teachers have made good progress in addressing the next steps, particularly in strengthening bicultural practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of fourteen kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kindergartens South).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide a rich and interesting curriculum that promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers have identified priorities for learning but these could more specifically included in the kindergarten philosophy. The kindergarten's vision to be visible in and connected to the local community is strongly evident. Children learn about the bush and sea environments and about local history. Local people enrich children's learning by sharing their knowledge and talents. Over time, teachers intentionally weave the localised curriculum into experiences that support children's mana and sense of whanaungatanga and kotahitanga.</p><p>Teachers also deliberately support children's:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>oral language skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing knowledge of mathematics and early literacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dispositions to learn such as independence and making choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tuakana/teina and skills to be friends.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children with diverse needs are thoughtfully provided for. Teachers are increasingly supporting children who have English as a second language. Children's transitions into kindergarten and to school are well supported by teachers.</p><p>Children experience enriched bicultural programmes and practices. The head teacher has led a planned approach to develop teachers' knowledge and implement a culturally responsive curriculum. Teachers have plans in place to continue developing their cultural competencies. Children’s culture and language is acknowledged and well supported in the programme. Teachers need to continue to find ways to improve assessment practices to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Māori children progressing well and succeeding as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how they value the diverse language and cultures of other children attending.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have identified that planning, assessment and evaluation is a work in progress. Best examples show the genuine partnerships teachers and whānau have as they work together to support children's learning. In records of individual and group learning teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly identify the desired learning outcomes and the strategies and experiences to support these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show their role in supporting the learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies and experiences in supporting learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have used internal evaluation to make improvements. Teachers need to continue to grow their understanding of inquiry and analysis to deepen and strengthen internal evaluation.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from ongoing and well-planned professional learning and development and is well supported by the Senior Teachers. A new appraisal system is being introduced, further development is required to include expectations for observations and explicit links to Tātaiako.</p><p>The kindergarten receives good support from KS. The KS board has a clear strategic vision that outlines key priorities for development. The next step is to ensure explicit alignment of these priorities to each kindergarten's long term planning. The board has identified that internal evaluation practice is not strong at board level. The board needs to receive evaluative reporting of how well these plans and other initiatives have been enacted and the impact on children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the head teacher and teachers with the support of the senior teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include desired outcomes for learning in the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the board are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the appraisal system continues to be developed and embedded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and use rigorous internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure explicit alignment of kindergarten planning to implement the KS strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive evaluative reporting of progress towards the strategic goals</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Riverton Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>24 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
