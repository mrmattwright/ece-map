</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Argyle Preschool is located in Hamilton and provides education and care for children from six months to school age. The preschool is privately owned and operated. It is licensed for 45 children, including 15 up to the age of two years. It operates a full-day programme from two adjoining character houses. At the time of this review, the roll of 44 included 7 MƒÅori and 4 Pacific children.</p><p>The preschool has been operating successfully under the same ownership and management for the past 21 years. One of the owners is the centre manager who provides overall professional leadership to staff. She is supported by a teacher who has leadership responsibility for children up to the age of two.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on family and whƒÅnau grouping. Children of mixed ages play and learn together happily. The preschool believes in nurturing independence and social skills within the security of a family group setting, to support transition with confidence and resilience.</p><p>The centre's governance and management have responded positively to the findings in the previous ERO report. The preschool has strengthened its self-review practices in curriculum areas and actively gathered different perspectives including parents' views to inform the review. Leaders have carried out formal observations of teaching, providing useful feedback and feedforward to improve teacher practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a wide variety of rich and stimulating learning opportunities for children. They are able to make independent choices about their own learning and develop positive skills for self-management. Special events and visitors to the preschool enrich meaningful learning experiences for children. Learning environments are attractive with displays of children‚Äôs artwork and creativity. The outdoor physical environment is integral to children's learning and exploration. The preschool‚Äôs 'family' philosophy and curriculum supports effective tuakana/teina relationships. Younger children benefit from learning naturally alongside older children. Children are highly engaged in their learning and play.</p><p>Teachers are effective in developing children‚Äôs thinking, confidence and skills. There are positive, warm and trusting relationships between teachers and children. Teachers provide opportunities to extend children‚Äôs learning through further exploration and problem-solving. Children with additional learning needs are well supported and included appropriately. Teachers use te reo in their interactions with children and the programme reflects aspects of MƒÅori and other cultures. MƒÅori and all other children have a strong sense of belonging. Leaders and teachers acknowledge the need to continue to strengthen the integration of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in curriculum planning and practice.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from responsive and respectful relationships. There is effective personalised communication with parents to meet individual needs. The environment is well-resourced with designated areas for play and learning. Children have many opportunities to exercise choice. Infants are confident, settled and happy in their surroundings.</p><p>Leadership is highly collaborative and supportive. Provision is made for professional learning and development for staff. The centre manager provides opportunities for teachers to develop their own leadership capabilities. Parents, families and whƒÅnau are welcomed and involved in preschool activities and share their knowledge, skills and expertise. Online learning portfolios support positive partnerships for learning with parents. Leadership is enabling quality teaching and learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The owners have a clear vision and direction for the preschool. The centre‚Äôs philosophy is well articulated and shared with staff, teachers, parents, families and whƒÅnau. Appropriate documentation guides all preschool operations. Ongoing, holistic self-review is leading to improved outcomes for children. There is a strong commitment to building effective relationships with parents and the local community. Children are safe and nurtured in a caring family environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>align the performance management system to the new Education Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider formal professional learning and development in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum (2017) to support planning and shared understanding for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalise expectations and documentation to identify children‚Äôs individual learning goals and next learning steps, to inform centre-wide curriculum planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Argyle Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Argyle Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>29 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
