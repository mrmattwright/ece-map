</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Awhi Pumau is situated in Kaitaia and provides education and care for up to 18 children who are over two years of age. The centre opened in July 2016 and this is the first Education Review report for the centre.</p><p>The vision and philosophy seek to build strong relationships and support the holistic needs of children and their whƒÅnau. The centre's aim is to build on productive partnerships with whƒÅnau and community to raise confident, competent and happy children.</p><p>The governance is managed by two owner operators who oversee the daily operations of the centre. The supervisor manages the curriculum and mentors teachers. Collaborative processes support staff in conducting the daily routines of the centre. All teachers are registered except for one who is presently in training.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their whƒÅnau. Children settle quickly and have a strong sense of belonging. They play confidently with their peers and teachers during the day. Notions of care are based on genuine attitudes of respect, acceptance and valuing people.</p><p>Teachers' interactions and relationships with children, parents and whƒÅnau are a strength in this centre. They use positive language, and open-ended questioning to encourage discussion with and between children. Teachers encourage children to talk about their play to support them to learn te reo MƒÅori and English.</p><p>The curriculum has a strong bilingual emphasis, clear recognition of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa. Concepts of tikanga and the values of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, whakapapa and wairuatanga are threaded through the inclusive curriculum. Ako is valued and practiced. Strong whƒÅnau relationships are a key feature.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's interests and strengths, language, culture and identity. They are reviewing links between programme planning and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, so planning is better aligned with learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Portfolios record children's learning and participation well. Teachers have good monitoring processes to ensure that children's learning is recorded and their stages of development are identified. Teachers and leaders respond well to children's identified learning needs. They should now ensure they focus more on children's learning goals when assessing their progress.</p><p>Transitions are managed well for children who are new to the centre. Teachers and leaders have programmes to support children as they transition to school. The centre has a positive relationship with the local primary school that the majority of children will attend.</p><p>The centre has well designed play areas with good flow between indoor and outdoor areas. Some outside areas have recently been redeveloped. Children are involved in gardening and learn about science, plants and food in an area designated for this purpose. Inside areas are identified for specific play activities. Resources are appropriate and adequate. Teachers could consider ways to make the environment more literacy and numeracy rich to further enhance children's learning of language and mathematical concepts.</p><p>Leaders manage and organise centre routines well. They work collaboratively with staff and one another. Staff culture is built on a sense of unity, cohesion and trust. Respect for one another and for children and parents' mana is evident. Effective systems for documenting learning and administration are in place.</p><p>Professional development is beginning to inform learning programmes and teaching practices. Teacher appraisal processes are well documented. A next step for leaders is to consider how they will broaden the scope of internal evaluation across all centre processes and operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Some key next steps for centre leaders to consider are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop the concept of 'teaching as inquiry' so that teachers reflect more deeply on their practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the complexity of play for older children, through programme planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring internal evaluation identifies the impact of professional development and curriculum planning, and the next steps to make further progress.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Awhi Pumau completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service needs to report to parents and the community how the service is using its equity funding.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Awhi Pumau will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>28 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
