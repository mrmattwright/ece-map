<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Katoa Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Relationships with families, wh&#257;nau and the wider community are regarded as vital to the success of the kindergarten. Teachers work hard to build these relationships and support parents for the benefit of children. The playgroup provides a stepping stone for parents to transition into kindergarten and incorporates programmes on effective parenting. Kindergarten teachers have established relationships with Ngati Toa and increased their knowledge of local tikanga. The kindergarten has built relationships with local schools and teachers encourage parents to arrange pre-school visits to assist their child&rsquo;s transition.</p><p align="left">The play environment is attractive and designed for good flow between the indoor and outdoor play areas. Resources support children&rsquo;s physical, imaginative and explorative play. Good use is made of the wider community environment to extend children&rsquo;s experiences.</p><p align="left">The programme is child-centred and reflects the guiding philosophy. Teachers are firm, responsive to children&rsquo;s needs, support their learning and maintain a calm tone. They give children a range of experiences in literacy and numeracy. Children are engaged, independent, act companionably to support each others&rsquo; learning and are confident to approach adults.</p><p align="left">Tikanga M&#257;ori is strongly reflected in the environment and programme. Te reo M&#257;ori is woven naturally into conversations. Kotahitanga time provides an additional opportunity to learn and practice te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Teachers are developing as a team. Self review requires strengthening to improve overall quality and effectiveness. The kindergarten teachers, in conjunction with the association, have provided a plan to address areas for review and development identified in this report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Katoa Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKatoa Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the June 2008 ERO review the kindergarten roll has increased. This follows the extension of three sessions to include afternoons and introduction of a Monday morning playgroup. A high percentage of children enrolled identify as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">There has been changing leadership with a new head teacher recently appointed. The teaching team is focusing on team building and the establishment of common understandings and practices.</p><p align="left">Environment upgrades include the provision of a kitchen area that parents and wh&#257;nau can access. The 5 year building plan includes actions to address the replacement of the current tyre retaining wall.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Environment The environment is attractive and designed for easy flow between indoors and outdoors via a covered veranda. A variety of resources supports a wide range of experiences in physical, imaginative and explorative play. Wall displays share aspects of the programme and celebrate children&rsquo;s involvement in these.</p><p align="left">Programme Children have a range of appropriate experiences and opportunities for early learning in literacy and numeracy. They are supported to become independent and encouraged to support each other. Children participate enthusiastically in highly imaginative socio-dramatic play. The kindergarten makes good use of the wider community environment to extend children&rsquo;s experiences.</p><p align="left">Tikanga M&#257;ori is strongly reflected in the environment and the programme. Te reo M&#257;ori is woven naturally into conversations. Kotahitanga time provides an opportunity to learn and practice te reo M&#257;ori. Use of their paua taonga and saying of their pepeha allows children to develop a sense of pride in their heritage. The expertise of M&#257;ori staff supports and enriches this aspect of the programme.</p><p align="left">Interactions Teachers have clear expectations of behaviour that are well understood by the children. This supports the development of children&rsquo;s social and emotional confidence. Children are contented, independent, confident to approach adults and act companionably.</p><p align="left">Parents and wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed and encouraged to stay and participate in activities. Most of these are recorded in children profiles of learning which are attractively presented and easily accessible.</p><p align="left">Wh&#257;nau and community involvement Kindergarten staff are proactive in their support of parents. The playgroup provides a stepping stone for parents to transition into kindergarten and provides programmes on effective parenting. Personnel have increased their knowledge of local tikanga and established relationships with Ngati Toa.</p><p align="left">Appraisal and feedback Senior teacher reports contain focused feedback with helpful next steps.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">ERO and kindergarten managers agree that:</p><p align="left">Self review requires strengthening. While a suitable framework for bringing about improvement has been developed, enhancement of staff understanding and implementation processes is likely to lead to more robust evaluation of the overall quality of provision for children and their families. It is necessary to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">teacher recognition and response to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and needs in programme planning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">consultation with parents/wh&#257;nau to learn about aspirations held for their children&rsquo;s development and success</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">processes for managing children&rsquo;s transitions, both within the kindergarten and from kindergarten to school.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">Since the onsite stage of this review, the kindergarten has developed an action plan to address these areas for development and review.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Katoa Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO noted that children playing in some areas outdoors were not easily visible to teachers. Since the onsite stage of this review the team has met and developed a roster to better position adults in the environment to address supervision of less visible areas.</p><p align="left">To further improve practice the management should:</p><ul>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-katoa-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">To the Parents and Community of Katoa Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Katoa Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Katoa Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Relationships with families, wh&#257;nau and the wider community are regarded as vital to the success of the kindergarten. Teachers work hard to build these relationships and support parents for the benefit of children. The playgroup provides a stepping stone for parents to transition into kindergarten and incorporates programmes on effective parenting. Kindergarten teachers have established relationships with Ngati Toa and increased their knowledge of local tikanga. The kindergarten has built relationships with local schools and teachers encourage parents to arrange pre-school visits to assist their child&rsquo;s transition.</p><p align="left">The play environment is attractive and designed for good flow between the indoor and outdoor play areas. Resources support children&rsquo;s physical, imaginative and explorative play. Good use is made of the wider community environment to extend children&rsquo;s experiences.</p><p align="left">The programme is child-centred and reflects the guiding philosophy. Teachers are firm, responsive to children&rsquo;s needs, support their learning and maintain a calm tone. They give children a range of experiences in literacy and numeracy. Children are engaged, independent, act companionably to support each others&rsquo; learning and are confident to approach adults.</p><p align="left">Tikanga M&#257;ori is strongly reflected in the environment and programme. Te reo M&#257;ori is woven naturally into conversations. Kotahitanga time provides an additional opportunity to learn and practice te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Teachers are developing as a team. Self review requires strengthening to improve overall quality and effectiveness. The kindergarten teachers, in conjunction with the association, have provided a plan to address areas for review and development identified in this report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
