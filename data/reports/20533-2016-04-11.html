</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Royal Oak Learning Centre is an established education and care service for children aged from three to five years. It occupies an older style renovated house in suburban Auckland. Since ERO's last review in February 2013, the centre has been relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Services regulations.</p><p>Staffing changes since 2013 include the appointment of a team leader and two new teachers. The induction of new staff, together with outdoor improvements and implementing a revised centre philosophy have been the focus of centre developments. Centre leaders are confident that recent changes in management and leadership will strengthen self-review.</p><p>The privately owned centre operates closely with the owner's nearby infants and toddlers centre. Many of those children transition to the learning centre at around three years of age. Staff work flexibly between the two centres. As a consequence they know the children well and build meaningful relationships with parents and families.</p><p>ERO's 2013 review identified the centre's commitment to a child led learning philosophy and to respectful interactions that underpin that philosophy. These features have been sustained. Learning opportunities for children have been further enhanced by well planned improvements in the outdoor area. Further development is needed now to embed new management systems, and promote shared expectations of teachers in relation to the centre's philosophy and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner and long serving staff share a deeply held commitment to the principles of<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and to the philosophy of learning through play. Children are encouraged to explore the environment, initiate their own activities, and seek their own resources. There is minimal interruption to children's learning. Teacher observe and support children's play without redirecting or engaging too closely in the process.</p><p>Positive outcomes of this approach to self-directed learning are seen in the ways children immerse themselves in extended activities both individually and in collaboration with others. Children communicate and problem solve as they engage in imaginative and sustained play throughout the day. In some group play contexts, children extend their learning through complex and challenging interactions.</p><p>Children access a wide range of natural resources, including those gathered on regular excursions to a nearby park. The large shaded outdoor area includes gardens, running water, sand, shell and mud. Tactile experiences and physical activity support genuine and authentic learning opportunities. Indoor activities are also well resourced. Children's creativity is actively promoted and evident in their construction, family play and art work.</p><p>Teachers value and respect children's diverse cultural and language backgrounds. Programme planning is well documented with photos and stories that allow children and families to revisit previous learning experiences. Teachers record their observations and comment on children's learning progress in individual portfolios they share with children and parents.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy learning is incorporated into many areas of children's play. Children are capable and confident communicators. They make friends, and develop independent learning skills. Teachers notice children's dispositions for learning and respond to their interests and strengths. Centre staff are continuing to seek ways to strengthen learning partnerships with parents and local schools.</p><p>Teachers attend regular team meetings to review the learning programme and discuss professional practice with centre leaders. Centre managers agree that greater clarity around the expectations and roles of teachers would better support the induction of new staff. The planned introduction of a new teacher appraisal system could also improve the ways staff receive feedback about their practice.</p><p>The team leader is strengthening her leadership role. This includes managing and appraising the teaching team, promoting the centre philosophy and supporting children's transition from the infant and toddlers centre. Centre managers are also successfully addressing ERO's 2013 report recommendation regarding the development of bicultural practices in consultation with MƒÅori whƒÅnau.</p><p>Self review is not yet a strength of centre management. Capability to evaluate progress in relation to goals and priorities is likely to improve as centre leaders become more strategically focused. The centre's commitment to providing positive outcomes for children and sustaining good early childhood practice will be further enhanced as self-review processes are systematically implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that priorities for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing a staff appraisal process that aligns with Education Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building a collaborative team culture based on shared expectations and constructive feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying and supporting the leadership role of the new team leader</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing goal-focused, and evaluative self-review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Royal Oak Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Royal Oak Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
