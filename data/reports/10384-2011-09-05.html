<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Bear Park Henderson No 2 is part of the Bear Park group of early childhood centres and caters for children over three years of age. The centre operates from the same purpose-built premises as Bear Park Henderson No 1 that caters for infants and toddlers. Many administrative and operational systems are common to both centres. The franchise management team provides centre owners within the group with advice, and audit and management support to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and franchise expectations.</p><p>This centre provides high quality education and care for children within a programme that is strongly influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children are competent and capable learners who make decisions, organise their play and are developing a good understanding of the world around them. High levels of enthusiasm and engagement are evident, as is children&rsquo;s confidence in the use of writing and information and communication technologies (ICT).</p><p>Parents express their appreciation of, and satisfaction with, the high quality of care and education provided for their children. They enjoy positive, reciprocal relationships with managers and teachers, and are kept well informed about the centre through its web page, wall displays and programme records. Daily interactions with teachers provide parents with valuable information about their children&rsquo;s progress and development.</p><p>A high quality learning programme is underpinned by sensitive and skilful teacher interactions. Teachers affirm and extend children&rsquo;s exploration and persistence with challenging tasks, and encourage the development of problem-solving skills. Teachers and children engage in research-based investigations and learn alongside each other. The cultural heritage of M&#257;ori children is affirmed through inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori and celebrations, such as Matariki, the M&#257;ori new year.</p><p>The licensee and the centre manager are responsible for the day to day operation of the two centres. Effective and efficient management practices are in place. Self review is used as an effective tool for ongoing evaluation and improvements in professional practice.</p><p>As a next step, ERO recommends, and centre managers agree, that teachers should continue to use self review to refine and enhance their high quality teaching and learning practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Bear Park Henderson No 2 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Bear Park Henderson No 2.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO report suggested that parents should be invited to contribute to children&rsquo;s learning records to build on teachers&rsquo; knowledge about children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Since the last ERO review teachers have strengthened parents&rsquo; involvement and partnership in this area.</p><p>Extensions to the outdoor learning environment have provided children with improved facilities for imaginative and active play.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Positive outcomes for children.</em> Children are capable and articulate learners. They engage in purposeful, sustained play, showing high levels of problem solving, persistence and curiosity. Children are:</p><ul>
<li>able to make decisions about and organise their own play</li>
<li>confident explorers</li>
<li>independent learners and enthusiastic writers</li>
<li>developing early skills in literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>competent users of technology</li>
<li>aware of the connection between designing and building their own constructions</li>
<li>developing respect for the natural world.</li>
</ul><p><em>Teaching practices.</em> Teachers provide a high quality programme. Their sensitive, skilful interactions affirm, support and extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Teachers&rsquo; use of te reo and tikanga is evident in learning records, displays and conversations. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s learning styles and preferences. They support children&rsquo;s active engagement and adapt to their individual pace of learning. Teachers understand their role in stimulating and supporting children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p><em>Learning environment.</em> The learning environment reflects the Reggio Emilia philosophy of the environment as &lsquo;the third teacher&rsquo;, within a New Zealand context. The centre environment is aesthetically pleasing, and helps to stimulate and sustain children&rsquo;s play. Bicultural and multicultural displays and resources support children&rsquo;s sense of cultural identity and self esteem. Natural resources are a feature of the centre.</p><p><em>Programme management.</em>&nbsp;The centre has developed well defined programme planning processes. Managers provide staff with generous amounts of non-contact time to evaluate children&rsquo;s learning and keep learning records up to date. High quality documentation reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of learning and emphasises children&rsquo;s participation in learning. Teachers learn alongside children and use research to enrich the depth of investigations that follow children&rsquo;s interests. Parents contribute their knowledge and expertise to enhance the programme. Children&rsquo;s portfolios provide useful connections between home and centre interests and activities.</p><p><em>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau and community.</em> Effective communication systems and positive relationships encourage parents&rsquo; partnership in their child&rsquo;s education. Parents are fully informed from the time of enrolment and are regularly updated on their children&rsquo;s progress and activities in the centre. They have opportunities to speak formally and informally with teachers about their children&rsquo;s learning. A parent committee provides further opportunities for parents to be involved in the centre. Parents report high levels of satisfaction with the service provided.</p><p><em>Leadership and management.</em> The Bear Park organisation provides strong support for centre leaders to implement administration and personnel systems and offers regular professional development opportunities. The centre manager provides teachers with professional leadership and consistent support. She knows the strengths of the teachers, the aspirations of the families for their children, and ensures that the daily operation of the centre is efficient. Self-review processes have been strengthened and are used as a tool for ongoing improvement in all areas of centre operations.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Further enhancing children&rsquo;s individual learning.</em> Teachers should continue to reflect on ways in which they could more clearly document the extension of children&rsquo;s emerging individual ideas, strengths and abilities.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><p>Eight M&#257;ori children are currently enrolled in this service.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>Teachers have considered biculturalism and the development of M&#257;ori cultural values in the programme over time. They have recently undertaken comprehensive and rigorous review of ways of encouraging centre partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Positive practices.</em> Teachers and centre managers consult M&#257;ori teachers about how to adapt centre practices to make learning programmes and the environment welcoming to M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. Effective practices include:</p><ul>
<li>cultural celebrations of significance to M&#257;ori</li>
<li>regular opportunities for children to participate confidently in waiata, karakia, poroporaki/farewelling processes</li>
<li>children learning short sentences in the M&#257;ori language</li>
<li>teachers fostering M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s pride in identifying themselves as M&#257;ori learners who have confidence to share aspects of their culture with their friends.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Documentation.</em> To foster a stronger sense of inclusion and partnership in the centre, teachers could learn about the local histories of the area so that they understand the significance of landmarks and events of importance to local M&#257;ori.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Bear Park Henderson No 2 completed an ERO <em>Centre Management Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-bear-park-henderson-no-2" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Bear Park Henderson No 2</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Bear Park Henderson No 2.</p><p>Bear Park Henderson No 2 is part of the Bear Park group of early childhood centres and caters for children over three years of age. The centre operates from the same purpose-built premises as Bear Park Henderson No 1 that caters for infants and toddlers. Many administrative and operational systems are common to both centres. The franchise management team provides centre owners within the group with advice, and audit and management support to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and franchise expectations.</p><p>This centre provides high quality education and care for children within a programme that is strongly influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children are competent and capable learners who make decisions, organise their play and are developing a good understanding of the world around them. High levels of enthusiasm and engagement are evident, as is children&rsquo;s confidence in the use of writing and information and communication technologies (ICT).</p><p>Parents express their appreciation of, and satisfaction with, the high quality of care and education provided for their children. They enjoy positive, reciprocal relationships with managers and teachers, and are kept well informed about the centre through its web page, wall displays and programme records. Daily interactions with teachers provide parents with valuable information about their children&rsquo;s progress and development.</p><p>A high quality learning programme is underpinned by sensitive and skilful teacher interactions. Teachers affirm and extend children&rsquo;s exploration and persistence with challenging tasks, and encourage the development of problem-solving skills. Teachers and children engage in research-based investigations and learn alongside each other. The cultural heritage of M&#257;ori children is affirmed through inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori and celebrations, such as Matariki, the M&#257;ori new year.</p><p>The licensee and the centre manager are responsible for the day to day operation of the two centres. Effective and efficient management practices are in place. Self review is used as an effective tool for ongoing evaluation and improvements in professional practice.</p><p>As a next step, ERO recommends, and centre managers agree, that teachers should continue to use self review to refine and enhance their high quality teaching and learning practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
