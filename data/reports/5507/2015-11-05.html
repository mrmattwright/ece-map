</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Kilda Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens operating under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). It is located near the beach and local schools in the St Kilda suburb of Dunedin. It provides learning experiences for up to 30 children from 8:30 in the morning to 2:30 in the afternoon. Children may attend all or part of the day as their family chooses.</p><p>Children benefit from enthusiastic, qualified teachers. Children enjoy playing and learning in the very well-resourced, spacious and attractive, indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor environment reflects the coastal setting. It offers children variety in well-defined spaces, and opportunities for physical challenge.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy states the importance of:</p><ul>
<li>caring relationships between teachers and children and their families</li>
<li>children driving their own learning through imaginative play and exploration</li>
<li>children being secure in their cultural identity</li>
<li>children developing a love for the natural environment.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have successfully addressed most of the recommendations in the June 2012, ERO report. They are continuing to work on lifting their levels of confidence and competence in the use of te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 reviews in the Dunedin Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are very settled. They relate well with their teachers and many appear to have strong friendships with each other and have fun together. Teachers help support children‚Äôs growing independence, they encourage them to make choices about how to set up their environment, what they want to do, and where and when to play and eat.</p><p>Children are helped by teachers to develop a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten and the local community. One aspect of this is the whƒÅnau tree showing photos of local features and the current children and teachers. Teachers know about their children‚Äôs diverse backgrounds and home lives and value what children bring to the kindergarten in terms of experiences, culture and things. They use these as a stimulus for learning and for having genuine conversations with children. They provide meaningful experiences to capture children‚Äôs interests, and purposefully include a bicultural dimension. They also include aspects of the Pacific cultures in the daily programme. Families are very supportive and involved in the programme and life of the kindergarten.</p><p>Children are provided with a wide range of experiences that stimulate their interest and support their oral language development. These include, art, gardening, the use of natural resources, magnetic stories, resources for construction, dramatic and imaginative play. Their learning is also enriched by:</p><ul>
<li>many visitors who come to share their skills and cultural celebrations</li>
<li>regular excursions within the local community and to other places of interest</li>
<li>a carefully considered transition to school programme.</li>
</ul><p>All teachers have taken part in professional learning and development to enrich the way they include mathematics, literacy and music in the programme. This has resulted in these being highly evident throughout the day.</p><p>Teachers have effective systems to plan for individual children‚Äôs learning. They formally meet with parents twice yearly to share knowledge and to gather parents‚Äô wishes for their children. The teaching team discusses all children over time to know about their learning. Children‚Äôs records of learning show:</p><ul>
<li>useful termly goals</li>
<li>ongoing assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>children‚Äôs progress and relevant stories of learning in a variety of contexts</li>
<li>what teachers are doing to support children‚Äôs further learning.</li>
</ul><p>There are well-developed group plans which provide children with variety and interest, and are responsive to the identified needs of the group.</p><p>Teachers understand the purpose and process of self review very well. They have carried out an effective review to know how well their philosophy is enacted in the programme. This led to positive changes in the philosophy and in teachers‚Äô practices. When next reviewing the philosophy, teachers should consider seeking parent input about what they consider is important at St Kilda Kindergarten.</p><p>The head teacher is leading the team well and has established useful systems to support the smooth running of the kindergarten and high quality learning for children.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers have a good idea of what they want for the future of the kindergarten. They have developed a strategic plan which currently includes every-day business. This plan could better show the priorities and actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Related systems such as professional learning, appraisal, self-review topics and senior-teacher support could then be aligned to strengthen the strategic focus.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association‚Äôs vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Kilda Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO found that the plans to manage risks during excursions could be more detailed so that all adults are clear about what to do if there is an incident.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Kilda Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>5 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
