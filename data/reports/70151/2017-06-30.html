</table><p>This centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rosy Cheeks Early Learning Centre is privately owned. It is licensed to have 35 children from two years old to school age at the centre. Some changes in leaders and teachers occurred in 2016.</p><p>Children attend the centre for varying amounts of time with almost all attending for just some parts of the week. Children come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. The owners deliberately employ staff who bring with them a wide range of experiences and teaching skills. Six staff have recognised early childhood qualifications.</p><p>The centre has successfully maintained and built on the strengths evident at the time of the 2014 ERO review. Good progress has been made towards implementing recommendations made at that time. This progress is most apparent in the improvements to assessment practices and programme planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is clearly evident in the quality of the learning environment, relationships and the ongoing focus on improving learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Teachers successfully promote children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging. Staff maintain a welcoming, calm and inclusive learning environment. They foster caring, supportive, respectful and responsive relationships with children. Teachers have an in-depth knowledge of each child and use this to successfully recognise and affirm their strengths, interests and progress. Children appear settled and happy.</p><p>Teachers successfully work in partnership with parents to build on children’s strengths and interests. Good communication, opportunities to contribute to assessments and decision making and involvement in meetings and centre activities foster supportive child-centred relationships.</p><p>The centre provides children with a well-considered and wide range of suitable learning opportunities and a stimulating learning environment. Children have appropriate opportunities to exercise choice, follow their interests and learn through play.</p><p>Other features of the curriculum include the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>well organised centre environment and children’s ready access to a wide variety of resources that encourage their involvement in exploratory play for sustained periods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quality of group activities and provisions for the transition of children into and from the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extent to which the programme and teaching practices help children to successfully engage in cooperative play, develop as confident learners and promote their independence.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers actively involve themselves in, and effectively support, children’s play. They are observant, reflective and responsive. Teachers plan programmes well and make appropriate adaptations to extend children's learning. Assessment practices help teachers to recognise and respond to children’s strengths, interests and to set learning goals.</p><p>The centre continues to value and respect children’s differing cultural backgrounds. Useful initiatives have been undertaken to help foster biculturalism. A strength of the centre is the effective way leaders and teachers respond to children with special learning needs.</p><p>The centre is effectively led. Leaders have high and clear expectations. They model what they expect of their staff, and are improvement focused. They make good use of staff strengths to improve learning opportunities for children and strengthen centre practices.</p><p>Centre plans establish clear priorities and focus action. Good systems have been established to support the effective operation of the centre. Ongoing internal evaluation, along with robust appraisals and targeted professional development, promote informed decision making and improvements to the care and education of children.</p><p>The manager’s networking with other local early childhood centres and schools helps to promote closer educational partnerships, extend professional knowledge and support children’s transition to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO affirms the priorities identified in the centre's strategic plan. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding and extending bicultural perspectives into centre programmes, practices and guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining aspects of programme planning and assessment to improve their usefulness. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rosy Cheeks Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rosy Cheeks Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>30 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
