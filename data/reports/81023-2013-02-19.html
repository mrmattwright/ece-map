<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Mornington Playcentre is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre will be better placed to promote positive outcomes for all children when there is a greater focus on individual children&rsquo;s learning. Self review needs to be regularly carried out to make ongoing improvements to the programme and practices.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Mornington Playcentre is one of 37 playcentres administered by the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). The playcentre is located next to the Mornington School.</p><p>The playcentre offers five morning sessions a week for children aged from birth to five years. The minimum attendance for a child is one session a week. Sessions are led by parent educators. There is high parent attendance and presence in the centre. Currently there are four parents in training for Playcentre qualifications. The playcentre also hosts a Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education (SPACE) session one afternoon a week for new parents and their babies.</p><p>The centre has made some progress on addressing some of the recommendations outlined in the 2009 Education Review Report. This includes having a greater inclusion of M&#257;ori perspectives and increased use of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme. Parts of the indoor environment have also been refurbished.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in fifteen early childhood education services within the OPA umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents and their children benefit from warm relationships with each other and a sense of community that the playcentre provides. They are made to feel very welcome on arrival. Children have fun and older children have good friendships with each other.</p><p>Some of the adults have very good sustained conversations with the children. When these conversations take place the adults help children to develop their thinking and numeracy skills. The next step is for more of the adults to have high quality conversations with children for more of the time. The parents and educators should:</p><ul>
<li>review the quality of all the adults&rsquo; interactions so that there is a greater focus on supporting children&rsquo;s thinking and learning.</li>
</ul><p>There is a wide variety of resources to stimulate children&rsquo;s play and imagination, for example, role play and dress up clothes, a train set, science experiences, sensory play and the pulley system for buckets in the sandpit. There is also a focus on early literacy. Children experience a wide range of activities and events. These include: bathing a baby, a visit from a story teller and visits to the library, fire station and airport.</p><p>Younger children confidently explore the outdoor area. There is potential to develop the outdoors to make it more challenging for the older children to extend their physical skills and promote their curiosity.</p><p>The education team is thinking about ways they can extend older children&rsquo;s learning and retain the older children at Playcentre until they move on to school. They are working on developing relationships with a number of schools. They are also trialling an extended session which is open to all children aged two and a half years and older. This is still under review and they have yet to evaluate how successful this has been.</p><p>All the children have many opportunities to visit the next door school. They join in a school-based physical movement programme and have regular visits to the library and the playground. This helps children feel comfortable in the school environment and supports them when they begin school.</p><p>The education team meets regularly to review the current learning stories, the session evaluations and to plan for the next two weeks. Learning stories for some individual and groups of children are displayed on the wall. Parents compile their own children&rsquo;s profile books. To make this system more effective the education team and parents need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a schedule so that all children can be planned for over time</li>
<li>find ways to encourage more parent participation in planning for their children</li>
<li>make better use of parents' aspirations and goals for their children when they are developing learning priorities for children</li>
<li>plan interactions and experiences for all adults to implement which focus on building on and extending individuals' and group learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre is in the early stage of using self review to inform its decision making and to make improvements. The parent council and educators now need to:</p><ul>
<li>explore and develop a shared understanding of self review</li>
<li>develop a schedule of reviews</li>
<li>find ways to review that are manageable and meaningful to help the centre to improve and monitor how well it is providing for children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>share the outcomes of self review with their centre advisor and with parents.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>the parent council and education team work with the centre advisor to address the next steps as outlined in this report.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mornington Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
