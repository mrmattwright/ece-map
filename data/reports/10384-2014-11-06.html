</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park Henderson continues to provide high quality education and care within a programme that incorporates <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Reggio Emilia philosophy. Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, the centre has been merged under one licence. It is now licensed for 95 children and caters for children from three months to school age. Children play and learn together in age-appropriate groupings. Children and teachers reflect the community‚Äôs ethnic diversity, and are predominantly NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, Chinese, MƒÅori and Samoan.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the Bear Park franchise. The franchise management group provides well developed policies, organisational frameworks and support to ensure consistency of practice. This provision is well implemented and regularly reviewed. The Bear Park pedagogical team works across and within ten centres to support teaching and learning. The centre owner oversees and guides day-to-day operations in collaboration with the supervisor and teachers.</p><p>The positive features of Bear Park Henderson acknowledged in ERO‚Äôs 2011 report continue to be evident. The centre has responded well to ERO‚Äôs recommendations that staff refine documentation related to children‚Äôs learning and acknowledge the significance of local bicultural heritage in centre programme planning.</p><p>Ongoing professional development over the past three years has focused on refining self review, documenting children‚Äôs learning clearly, and further developing teachers‚Äô use of open-ended questions. The most recent professional learning has focused on increasing teachers‚Äô knowledge of, and confidence in using, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A warm, caring and inviting tone permeates the centre. Children benefit from high quality interactions and positive relationships with teachers and with each other. Children‚Äôs settled behaviour reflects their strong sense of belonging in the centre. They engage confidently and positively with teachers and with the richly resourced environment.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value the importance of children learning through play. Children‚Äôs curiosity and sense of exploration are encouraged by well considered resourcing and the carefully adapted, inviting environment. The level of resourcing supports children to make choices, experience challenges and revisit prior learning.</p><p>Children are well nurtured through reciprocal and respectful relationships between teachers and families. Their diverse cultural backgrounds are clearly reflected in the environment. Children‚Äôs transitions into and within the service, and when moving onto school, are well managed.</p><p>In this service, consistency and continuity provide a sound foundation for children‚Äôs education and care. Children under two years of age experience a supportive environment in which teachers respond positively to their preferences and cues. Teachers maintain a calm, unhurried pace, giving younger children space and time to lead their learning. Staff work well with parents around children‚Äôs routines and developmental needs.</p><p>Children of all ages enjoy a variety of rich learning opportunities and experiences that integrate literacy, mathematics and the sciences. A recent review of the mathematics curriculum has shown how widely mathematical concepts and learning are included in the daily programme. Teachers and leaders are now keen to further explore ways to evaluate the content and quality of mathematics and other learning areas in children‚Äôs programmes. They are also building parents‚Äô knowledge of ways in which the Bear Park programme provides foundation learning for children‚Äôs future education.</p><p>Bicultural appreciation and awareness are evident in this service. Ongoing professional development, specifically in 2014, has increased teachers‚Äô bicultural understanding. Displays, books and many aspects of the programme reflect the value placed on MƒÅori as tangata whenua. A recent review of the service‚Äôs strategic plan to include this aspect is further evidence of a commitment to prioritise biculturalism in centre practices.</p><p>Through self review, centre leaders have identified a next step is to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching practices in affirming the learning and development of Pacific children within the context of their service.</p><p>A strong focus on continual improvement is evident. Teachers are reflective and use staff meetings effectively to discuss teaching strategies and to design the programme. They are developing a set of shared beliefs and fostering collaborative ways of working.</p><p>An improved approach to planning and assessment is providing teachers with a clear shared purpose in observing children‚Äôs play and participation in the programme. These observations enable teachers to better identify and respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are committed to further developing learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau/aiga. They have recently provided digital records of children‚Äôs learning that encourage parents to access, comment on, and contribute to their children‚Äôs learning programme. There are early indications of the success of this approach.</p><p>The governance and management of the centre is efficient and effective. Centre leaders have a good understanding of the dual purposes of self review, accountability and ongoing improvement. The strategic direction outlined for the centre clearly reflects the service‚Äôs priorities and associated goals for the provision of high quality care and educational outcomes for all children. The performance management system now supports teachers to reflect more critically on teaching practice. Strong systems, policies and practices to monitor and promote physical and emotional health and safety are well understood by staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers discussed the following key next steps in this centre‚Äôs ongoing improvement:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen staff capability in the use of evidence-based self review focused on the quality of programmes and practices</li>
<li>ensuring that the centre‚Äôs commitment to bicultural practices and the value placed on MƒÅori as tangata whenua is explicit and evident in documentation, practices and self-review procedures.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park Henderson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park Henderson will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>6 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
