</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Anchorage Park Kindergarten, located in Pakuranga, next to Anchorage Park School, provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years old. The kindergarten operates sessions with hours that match those of schools. Some children attend for mornings only.</p><p>Anchorage Park Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) provides management and curriculum support for teachers. The Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) has high expectations that teachers will provide a bicultural programme.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy places priority on developing strong partnerships between teachers, children, families and the community. Children are viewed as capable and competent learners. Teachers‚Äô belief that children‚Äôs learning opportunities and possibilities are enhanced by teachers recognising, valuing, listening and responding to their ideas and needs is clearly reflected in centre practices.</p><p>Anchorage Park Kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports. The kindergarten continues to provide a high quality programme that is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and reflects Reggio Emilia practices. Teachers continue to engage in ongoing research and professional development to enhance the high quality education programmes provided.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers care about their children, parents and families and know them well. Respectful relationships are valued and underpin kindergarten operations. They lead to strong partnerships with children, parents and community. The kindergarten listens to its community and strives to meet its needs.</p><p>Children receive a high quality programme. They play cooperatively and collaboratively in a stimulating, inviting and well resourced environment. They are empowered to be learners and to inquire, want to learn, try things out, problem solve and pursue emerging interests through play. Teachers give time for children to process and learn, and allow them to lead this learning. Teachers‚Äô timely and respectful interventions support children to persevere and take risks in their learning.</p><p>Teachers ensure that children are actively engaged in learning. They have high expectations of children as learners. Literacy, numeracy and science are integrated into the programme. Creativity through the arts is valued and extended. Effective planning systems reflect the ways in which children‚Äôs interests guide the programme.</p><p>Teachers value and celebrate children‚Äôs learning and their identity. They are positive role models. Teachers‚Äô commitment to using te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, and their respect for MƒÅori as tangata whenua, are positive features of the kindergarten. The kindergarten caters effectively for children with additional needs and is supportive of children and families who are new speakers of English. Teachers plan very good processes to support children‚Äôs transition to school.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and have a high level of understanding of current early childhood approaches and trends. Their appraisal processes enable them to share strengths and leadership opportunities. Teachers share their knowledge widely with other kindergartens and with international visitors.</p><p>Well documented, evidence-based processes inform self review. Teachers use self review to guide continuous improvements to kindergarten programmes and operations. Self review is purposeful and results in change and improvement. The annual plan is used effectively as a guide to implementing the strategic plan, and progress against annual and strategic goals is regularly reviewed.</p><p>Leadership is calm and respectful. Teachers are a dedicated team, with a high work ethic. They take real pride in their work. Consistent practice and processes provide shared understandings that promote ongoing learning and improvement.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to provide strong governance for its kindergartens. Positive strategies include effective professional learning and development that is responsive to strengthening teachers‚Äô professional skills, knowledge and practice. Distributed leadership among kindergarten teaching teams is also promoted and the sharing of knowledge and expertise within the Association is encouraged. Association leaders are currently reviewing the appraisal process and continue to explore appropriate ways to support teachers and ensure high quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that the kindergarten could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>work in partnership with parents to ensure the diverse ethnicities of learners are included in the programme</li>
<li>explore local whakapapa and iwi connections to further enhance teaching about te ao Maori</li>
<li>further develop foundation skills that support children to become life-long learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Anchorage Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Anchorage Park Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>28 November 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
