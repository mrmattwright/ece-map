</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz World - Brent Road is one of three privately owned centres under the same management. The centre caters for children from birth to school age in two age-related rooms. It is licensed for 43 children including 18 up to two years of age. There are 39 children on the roll and at the time of this ERO review there were 16 children who are identified as MƒÅori. The centre has full day sessions.</p><p>The centre is governed and managed by an owner/director and a leadership team that works collaboratively in overseeing the three centres. Since the 2013 ERO review, a new supervisor has been appointed in the over-two room. There has been very few additional changes to the teaching and leadership teams. Under the leadership of the director, centre manager and education manager, teachers have focused on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building their own capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using self review for ongoing centre improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging parents and whƒÅnau in their child's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre philosophy promotes learning though play. Children are empowered to take measurable risks to extend their learning. They are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves in becoming capable, confident and competent learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has established an inclusive culture. Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre by teachers and leaders. They quickly develop a sense of belonging and are well supported as they transition into and within the centre.</p><p>Children's social competencies and life skills are strongly promoted. Deliberate teaching strategies and responsive routines such as kai provision, sleep times, respectful care practices, and social interactions with their peers and teachers support and enable children to develop early independence.</p><p>Infants and toddlers learn and play in a spacious, home-like environment that supports their sense of security and belonging, and motivates their curiosity and exploration. They benefit from a stable, consistent and collaborative teaching team and low adult-to-child ratios. Flexible, responsive and unhurried routines ensure that children's individual needs and preferences are respected, acknowledged and responded to. In this room, children's language and non-verbal cues are understood and promoted through meaningful activities and contexts. They benefit from loving and caring relationships.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive to children's interests and preferences. They join children in play and listen carefully to them and their parents. Children are encouraged to take the lead, make choices, and express their ideas and working theories. This results in happy, settled children who are engaged in self-directed exploration and learning. They are confident to approach adults and visitors to the centre.</p><p>The centre curriculum is strongly grounded in early childhood best practice, and underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and the centre's own philosophy. Children have many opportunities to extend their interests through authentic learning opportunities that promote their early literacy, science and mathematical knowledge and skills. A current focus of the curriculum is an increasing emphasis on natural materials, respect for living things and papat≈´ƒÅnuku, and environmentally sustainable practices. Children are highly engaged learners who confidently explore, investigate, and set their own challenges.</p><p>Good progress is being made in establishing bicultural understandings and practice. Teachers are developing their confidence in using te reo MƒÅori and building knowledge of local history. They seek contributions from local kaumƒÅtua to strengthen the bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Sustained self review of assessment practices is making the learning clearer and more meaningful for children and their parents/whƒÅnau. Teachers are placing more emphasis on noticing and interpreting children's learning and using this information to plan for future learning experiences. In addition, teachers have reviewed the way that they communicate children's learning with parents. This is having a positive impact on parents' engagement with, contribution to, and understanding of their child's learning and development.</p><p>Teachers benefit from a well-established, collegial professional culture. Professional development for teachers is constantly being generated, promoted and fostered by the centre leaders. Teachers have engaged in learning about positive responses to children's behaviour, children with diverse needs, and sharing of good practice. This is having a positive impact on the quality of education and care for children.</p><p>The leadership team is providing capable and confident guidance for teachers. Leaders are implementing highly effective systems and processes for guiding teacher practice and improving provisions for children and families. Systems are informed by evidence-based self review that includes well-considered indicators of success. The education manager, in collaboration with the centre director, is implementing an effective, well-aligned and highly responsive appraisal process. This process includes ongoing coaching and mentoring, self reflection, peer feedback and observations of practice. High levels of relational trust are resulting in a strong team culture where there is open communication and constructive feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team identifies that, following a period of positive growth and development, it will be important to continue to embed, consolidate and sustain the highly effective teaching practices and centre direction. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to explore ways to affirm the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further embedding the teacher appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sharing teaching strategies that successfully promote children's learning and play.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz World - Brent Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz World - Brent Road will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>2 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
