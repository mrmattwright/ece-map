</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tots Love Country education and care centre is a privately owned centre located in well-presented, safe and attractive rural surrounds near to the Hamilton Zoo. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children including up to 10 under two years. The centre operates in a mixed-age setting between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm on week days. At the time of this ERO review the roll had increased to 39 children including 15 children aged under two years and 3 Māori children.</p><p>The centre continues to operate under the governance and management of the owners and centre manager. Since the 2014 ERO review, a new manager was appointed and there have been a number of changes to teaching staff.</p><p>With support from ERO and the Ministry of Education an action plan was developed and documented in 2014. The actions have been effectively implemented to address the areas requiring improvement identified in the 2014 ERO report. During the past two years, the centre has benefitted from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focussed leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supportive governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional support and guidance from the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the commitment of teachers to participate in ongoing, relevant, whole-staff professional learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This has resulted in significant improvements to the areas for development identified in the 2014 ERO report related to strategic direction, self review, strengthening bicultural practices and improving the quality of assessment and evaluation, particularly for individual children.</p><p>In addition, wide consultation led to a review of the vision, philosophy, and the development of a new visual logo to reflect these. The centre aims to grow confident, independent learners to embrace papatūānuku and reflect a holistic approach to valuing the place of whānau. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tots Love Country is well placed to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from the opportunity to play and learn in a mixed-age setting alongside siblings. There is a strong, whānau-based culture for learning. Bicultural practices are consistently integrated in the programme. Children enjoy sharing karakia, kai, waiata, stories of local significance to Maori. They benefit from tuakana-teina relationships and the recognition of the strengths they bring. Papatūānuku is visible, valued and meaningfully included in the life of the centre. A good example of this is children regularly gathering eggs from the chickens, using these for cooking, and sharing at kai time. Leftover food is fed to centre pets. This approach is building children's knowledge about sustainability, and experiences that are building children's knowledge about their cultural heritage and Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>There are rich opportunities for children to learn about literacy and mathematics in meaningful and wide-ranging contexts. A particular feature is the specialised carpentry and construction area built for the centre by a skilled builder. Teachers and children benefit from working alongside trained craftsmen and learning useful techniques for construction. The life of the surrounding rural environment is carefully integrated into the programme where children are able to observe seasonal farming activities.</p><p>An effective review of centre routines has resulted in a flexible approach, which is promoting children's ability to make choices and engage in sustained play. Children are encouraged to explore, experiment, discover, imagine and create in a spacious, well-planned natural environment.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are sensitively included in play and learning alongside their siblings and older children. Experienced teachers offer responsive care and nurture, and support infants to maintain familiar routines from home. Good communication strategies promote continuity of care between home and the centre for very young children.</p><p>A calm and respectful environment contributes to the wellbeing of children identified with special needs. Teachers work in professional partnership with specialist agencies. Children are settled and actively involved in play alongside their peers and teachers.</p><p>Teachers are collaborative and reflective. They meet regularly to share:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning, and evaluation of children's learning and development, centred about individual children's strengths and interests</li>
<li>planned and spontaneous reviews of centre practice and organisation</li>
<li>professional learning and dialogue.</li>
</ul><p>Intentional, whole staff and ongoing professional learning has resulted in a positive team culture. The centre manager is a model of good practice. She has implemented strategies and initiatives that foster teamwork, knowledge of best practice, and emergent leadership. ERO observed deliberate acts of teaching that included:</p><ul>
<li>using conversations that build children's social skills, knowledge of the wider world and oral language</li>
<li>teachers knowing children well, when to engage in their learning and when to allow for uninterrupted play</li>
<li>calm and unhurried practice</li>
<li>carefully planned and prepared environments that lead to high levels of engagement for children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have established meaningful and constructive partnerships with families and whānau. They respond to parent aspirations for the learning and care of children. Teachers acknowledge the positive and shared culture resulting from ongoing, effective self review and a shared philosophy.</p><p>A particular strength is the commitment teachers have made to increase their knowledge and use of te reo and tikanga Māori. In addition teachers have established meaningful links with the nearby Te Papa Orotu Marae. Māori parents expressed appreciation for the warm, welcoming, and responsive approach to children and their whānau.</p><p>Centre owners and leaders have developed effective systems and processes to govern the centre. There is a good understanding of best practice in early childhood and Ministry of Education (MoE) expectations. This is evident in:</p><ul>
<li>a clear and shared vision</li>
<li>a documented strategic plan aligned with MoE requirements</li>
<li>self-review systems informed by consultation, aligned with strategic planning and linked to best practice criteria</li>
<li>open, transparent, positive and respectful relationships amongst all stakeholders.</li>
</ul><p>Under the leadership of the recently appointed centre manager, significant improvements have been made to centre operations. Particular strengths are:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing development of professional practice</li>
<li>rigorous appraisal</li>
<li>increased understanding of culturally responsive practices</li>
<li>consistently implemented assessment, planning, and evaluation processes and expectations.</li>
</ul><p>Owners, leaders, teachers, families and whānau are benefitting from clear and high expectations, a strong team culture, meaningful engagement in learning for children and an increased partnership with whānau and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers should now plan for ways to consistently add complexity and challenge to children's learning in all areas of play. This is likely to support teachers to meet the intent of the centre's vision for growing independent and competent children. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tots Love Country completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tots Love Country will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>15 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
