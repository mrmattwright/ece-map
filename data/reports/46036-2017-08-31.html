</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ngā Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited is privately owned and located in Kaitaia township. It opened in 2013 in a renovated council building that was originally the Kaitaia library. The centre was renamed and relicensed to meet the requirements of the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations in 2014.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 30 tamariki, including up to five under two years of age. It provides education and care in a te reo Māori bilingual setting. The majority of tamariki and their whānau are from the local community and have close family ties.</p><p>The management committee, which includes the owner, centre manager and two members from the community, make strategic decisions for the centre.  The centre manager oversees the daily centre operations. The centre manager and kaiako are actively involved in the Far North Community of Learning|Kāhui Ako.  They use this group as a platform to raise awareness of community and whānau aspirations.</p><p>There are six permanent staff members, including the centre manager and two other kaiako who are registered teachers, two kaiawhina and a kaikihini.</p><p>The centre's philosophy reflects the concepts of whakawhanaungatanga as the guiding principle to build on relationships to support the holistic development of the tamaiti. The philosophy encapsulates the belief that "it takes an iwi to raise a child".</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kaiako relationships with tamariki and whānau are caring and respectful. Tamariki quickly settle into the welcoming environment and the programme.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive and culturally relevant. Tamariki are confident and show a high level of enjoyment in their play. They play well together and their play is supported and valued by kaiako. Kaiako need to strengthen provision for tamariki to support their individual stages of development.</p><p>Kaiako know tamariki and their whānau well. They value strong relationships and encourage whānau to contribute to the learning of their tamariki. Kaiako should continue to promote healthy nutritious foods in the lunchboxes that tamariki bring to the centre. They can model this in the foods they provide for tamariki.</p><p>Some kaiako have high levels of te reo Māori. To support their intention of being bilingual and strengthen the programme, kaiako should continue to increase the use and documentation of te reo me ōna tikanga Māori.</p><p>Kaiako skilfully work alongside tamariki during their play experiences. Tamariki would benefit from more opportunities for creative and imaginative play and access to a wider range of quality resources that offer more variety and challenges.</p><p>Kaiako meet to collaboratively plan in response to the interests of tamariki and community events, and to evaluate the programme. Strengthening programme planning is required so that kaiako connect it more with their daily activities and establish more purposeful teaching strategies. This could result in more robust evaluation of the impact that their teaching strategies have on the quality of the learning and help kaiako to further develop planning and evaluation processes.</p><p>Staff have been involved in professional development workshops and network with community, social and education agencies to support the wellbeing of tamariki and their whānau. They could now work towards making changes to bring about ongoing improvement to the learning of tamariki in the centre. Staff are developing and should continue to strengthen internal evaluation to guide improvements across all aspects of the centre. </p><p>The centre's governance and management structure supports the work of the manager, who develops most of the documentation required for centre operations. The owner and the centre manager make decisions on centre's future plans. They appraise all staff to help improve learning experiences and outcomes for tamariki. They will need to review aspects of the appraisal process so that it is clearly aligned with staff roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and kaiako should access external expertise and advice to help them to develop effective teaching practices. These practices should focus on extending thinking and supporting tamariki to engage in deeper learning and more complex play. In particular managers and kaiako should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation to help them identify and extend individual children's interests, learning and progress overtime</li>
<li>review the curriculum and purchase open-ended resources that add complexity to play and learning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen internal evaluation so it leads to ongoing improvements in teaching and learning. </li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the management committee are to: </p><ul>
<li>strengthen personnel policies and procedures, and clarify management and staff roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>align teachers' appraisal with centre goals and Education Council requirements, and identify goals to extend kaiako professional practice and knowledge</li>
<li>develop strategic and annual action plans to prioritise strategic goals for centre development</li>
<li>regularly evaluate progress towards long-term centre goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ngā Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management, the quality of the curriculum, and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>records of risk assessment, analysis and management, including clear identification of adult-to-child ratios</li>
<li>records of emergency drills carried out and evaluation that informs the annual review of the service's emergency plan</li>
<li>clean individual bedding for tamariki, appropriately arranged and spaced when in use, and hygienically stored when not in use</li>
<li>suitable personnel policies, procedures and practices that ensure the service meets its legal obligations.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS8, 10, 11, 17; GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ngā Wawata Bi-Lingual Early Childhood Centre Limited will be within two years. </p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>31 August 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
