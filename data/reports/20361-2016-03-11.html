</table><p>The governors, manager and supervisor would benefit from external support to build leadership capacity and coherent management systems that support teachers to improve the curriculum for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waitakere Rainbow Childcare Centre is a community centre licensed for 40 children, including up to nine children under two years of age. The centre is located in the grounds of Waitakere Hospital and provides an all-day education and care service.</p><p>Children are grouped in two spaces according to their age and can move freely between these spaces. The centre caters for an ethnically diverse community. Six of the children identify as MƒÅori and three are of Pacific Island origin. Most children at the centre have parents working at Waitakere Hospital.</p><p>The centre functions as an Incorporated Society involving parent representatives. The buildings and land are owned by the Waitemata District Health Board (DHB).</p><p>Since the last ERO review the governance committee has employed an early education management group to manage the centre. The centre has gone through a series of roll fluctuations and staff redundancies. In the last six months new teachers have been appointed, along with a new centre supervisor who has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The centre is emerging from a period of restructuring of management and teacher resourcing. Management‚Äôs main strategy and focus has been on setting up a service that brings about positive and sustained change, and improved outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whƒÅnau generally experience respectful relationships with kind and caring teachers. Mixed-age play opportunities are encouraged and valued. Older children have appropriate spaces to work and play. They have uninterrupted play with unobtrusive centre routines. There is a gentle pace throughout the day. Strengthening the provision for up to twos, including recognising their physical need for movement and focusing more on the individual child are necessary next steps.</p><p>The recent employment of a new supervisor has created a new leadership team for the centre. Teachers are enthusiastic and are in the beginning stages of developing as a team. It is important that roles and expectations are now clarified through strategic and annual planning.</p><p>Teachers skilfully settle and work alongside children, following their play experiences. Children would, however, benefit from more opportunities for creative and imaginative play, and access to a wider range of resources that offer more variety and challenge.</p><p>Teachers and parents have begun to improve the quality of the centre environment. To bring the centre up to add the identified high quality environment for children, it will be necessary to review the outdoor area and prioritise the actions necessary to improve the environment.</p><p>The manager and supervisor are keen to develop a high quality programme through assessing the effectiveness of teaching practices and how they respond to children‚Äôs learning and interests. It would be useful to unpack the centre philosophy and develop indicators to guide teaching practices. This could be shared with the community to clarify and refine the centre‚Äôs purpose and approach to working with children and parents/whƒÅnau.</p><p>Leaders and teachers would also benefit from appropriate and ongoing professional support to build leadership capacity within the centre. Teacher appraisal processes should be implemented with the new team to help raise the quality of teaching and learning practice.</p><p>Centre self-review processes are at the beginning stages of development. Processes need to be more rigorous to effectively raise the quality of centre practices. Outcomes of reviews should be used to guide centre improvements and long-term development goals.</p><p>A governance committee works to strategically manage the centre. To effectively move the centre forward it is important that the governing body includes all its stakeholders in shaping a shared vision for the centre. Closer liaison with DHB managers could create a more sustainable relationship to help improve the quality of education and care at the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and supervisor agree the priorities for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>improving the quality of teaching practice through ongoing provision of professional learning and development, and implementation of an effective appraisal processes</li>
<li>strengthening provision for children up to two years</li>
<li>increasing the quality and accessibility of resources to enhance children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>renewing and developing the centre philosophy, vision and values</li>
<li>providing professional development to develop leadership capability and sustainability</li>
<li>establishing robust self review to clearly identify next steps for the centre as a framework to guide ongoing and sustainable improvement.</li>
</ul><p>The manager and supervisor recognise external professional development, advice and support is needed to make these improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waitakere Rainbow Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>whenever children leave the premises on an excursion procedures for assessing and managing potential risks must be undertaken and documented</li>
<li>a sufficient quantity and variety of (indoor and outdoor) furniture, equipment, and materials appropriate for the learning and abilities of the children attending, should be provided</li>
<li>all indoor and outdoor items and surfaces, furniture, equipment and materials are safe and suitable for their intended use.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> <em>HS17, PF4, PF5.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waitakere Rainbow Childcare Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
