</table><p><span>Riverhills¬†Early Learning Centre¬†</span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riverhills Early Learning Centre operates from an adapted residential property in East Auckland. It is licensed for 35 children, including five children up to two years of age. Families attending the centre come from diverse cultures with half being of MƒÅori heritage. A small number of children come from the Pacific nations of Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands. Staff have been employed to reflect the cultures of families attending the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy expresses the goal of providing whƒÅnau and <span lang="mi">tamariki</span> with a sense of belonging. It recognises the value of collaboration as vital to the success of the programme. Four key principles focus on attitudes, being present for and enjoying others, and promoting a positive work environment.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO report the centre has been modified internally and has had its outdoor area revamped. The service operated from a classroom at a local school for 18 months during these alterations. Most staff members are recent appointments. The teaching team includes three registered teachers and two teachers in training.</p><p>The centre continues to reflect strengths identified in the 2016 ERO report. Staff have made progress in consolidating planning and assessment processes and other reported areas for improvement. However, extending children's thinking and complex play, reviewing resources, and documenting children's individual interests over time remain areas to address.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are welcomed into a mixed-aged learning environment. They are supported to settle and form positive relationships with their peers and teachers. Children know routines and engage in them well. They receive good quality care and enjoy their time together within a family-like culture. Children would benefit from opportunities to lead their learning in more meaningful ways.</p><p>Infants and toddlers gain from <span lang="mi">tuakana/teina</span> experiences as well as having access to their own separate space. Teachers are culturally responsive, caring and respond positively to these young children's needs.</p><p>Teachers have placed more emphasis on delivering a bicultural programme. Features of <span lang="mi">tikanga MƒÅori</span> are evident, as are the <span lang="mi">manaakitanga and whanaungatanga</span> shown by staff to children and their whƒÅnau. Aspects of <span lang="mi">te ao MƒÅori</span> are evident in centre displays, interactions with children and <span lang="mi">karakia.</span></p><p>Teachers' communication with parents has strengthened over time. An online system is enabling parents to contribute more fully in their child's learning. Teachers have recently introduced new ways of planning and assessment. They work collaboratively to plan programmes for individual and groups of children's interests and strengths. Teachers should also consider ways to extend each child's learning.</p><p>The centre has established strong links with the local school. This has resulted in good practices for children transitioning to that school. Teachers also sensitively manage transitions for children and families into the centre.</p><p>The centre owner adopts a collaborative leadership approach. Positive staff relationships and wellbeing are features of the centre. Staff strengths are used to develop leadership opportunities. Spontaneous internal evaluation is well documented with good prompts and inquiry questions to assist the process. Teachers should plan for longer term internal evaluation, particularly in relation to the key next steps identified below.</p><p>The long-serving owner has been deliberate in the centre's future direction, including expansion of the building, facilities and grounds, to improve conditions for children and staff. Many policies and procedures have been updated to reflect current legislative requirements. An appraisal process is evident and should be strengthened by documenting an appraisal policy and related procedures.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extending children's thinking and complex play through play-based learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing children's independence to make choices about their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring all staff have opportunities to develop their teaching capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and documenting planned internal evaluation that links with strategic and annual planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverhills Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>15 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" target="_blank" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
