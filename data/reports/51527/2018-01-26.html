</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fordell Preschool is located in a rural setting near Whanganui. It is owned by an incorporated society and administered by a parent-committee comprised of volunteers. Two parents steer the committee as co-chairpersons.</p><p>The centre is licensed for up to 23 children aged over two years. At the time of this review there were 18 children enrolled.</p><p>Since the March 2015 ERO report there have been staffing changes. The team has decreased to two teachers. The licensee was appointed to the head teacher position in Term 4, 2017. The head teacher works closely with the co-chairpersons to implement the centre's strategic direction.</p><p>The philosophy places emphasis on encouraging the community to have a strong sense of ownership and belonging in the centre. A focus to promote quality interactions through reciprocal, compassionate, warm and friendly relationships and support children's emotional wellbeing is prioritised.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy learning through play. They explore, challenge themselves and are creative as they actively engage in the spacious outdoor areas.</p><p>Children experience warm and respectful interactions with peers and teachers. They show confidence and communicate openly, as they take part in familiar rituals and routines. Many engage in purposeful learning for sustained periods. Children with additional needs are supported within an inclusive environment.</p><p>Staff state that the centre values, along with children's emerging interests, underpin the teaching and learning.¬† However, teaching practice is variable. To improve consistency, teachers should continue to discuss and promote effective practice and strengthen the strategies they use to ensure that they hear and respond to children's needs.¬†</p><p>Leaders identify that the curriculum should be more responsive to children's culture. Te ao MƒÅori understanding is promoted through teachers' use of te reo MƒÅori with children. This includes waiata, tikanga, kupu MƒÅori, artifacts, stories and celebration of Matariki. Continuing to develop knowledge of MƒÅori, Pacific and other ethnicities will further enrich children's culture, language and identity.</p><p>Assessment and planning requires strengthening. Information about children's interests is gathered through teacher observations and used to decide goals for individual children. Learning stories, the centre's assessment tool, outline programme participation, particularly for groups. ¬†They do not show how individual children's goals are met. Improving assessment practice to include ways to show progress for children is a next step.</p><p>Families' and whƒÅnau input and feedback is regularly sought and valued. It informs decisions about the learning programme and operation. Continuing to develop relationships with parents is an appropriate focus to enable learning partnerships to be established.</p><p>A well-considered process is in place to support children and families to transition into the centre and on to schools.</p><p>Leadership and governance needs strengthening to enable improved provision for children, with a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>using the newly introduced internal evaluation framework to know about what works and what needs to change</li>
<li>developing the appraisal system to build and support professional practice</li>
<li>clarifying the understanding of roles and responsibilities of the committee and head teacher.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent committee, leaders and teachers should be supported to:</p><ul>
<li>build capability in assessment and planning</li>
<li>strengthen appraisal systems</li>
<li>improve knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation</li>
<li>develop the cultural responsiveness of the curriculum</li>
<li>clarify roles and responsibilities.¬†</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fordell Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and the provision of an effective early childhood education for children.</p><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance by ensuring that it:</p><ul>
<li>is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including review practices.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fordell Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</p><p>26 January 2018¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
