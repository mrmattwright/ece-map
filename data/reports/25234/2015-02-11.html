</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papatoetoe Playcentre is a parent cooperative operating under the umbrella of the Tamaki Playcentre Association. It is one of 16 centres in the Tamaki Playcentres Association. The centre is governed by the Association which provides a management and policy framework to guide centre operations. Liaison officers and other Association staff provide support for centres, including adult education programmes to encourage children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>A key feature of Playcentre is that children and parents learn alongside one another. It promotes the philosophy of the parents as first teachers of their children.</p><p>Papatoetoe Playcentre is licensed for 30 children, including 16 up to two years. It offers five sessions for children of mixed ages each week. The centre is well established and currently caters for up to 19 families.</p><p>The Playcentre Association is currently undergoing a national review to streamline its systems, policies and practices and promote the long-term sustainability of the organisation. A key priority is empowering playcentre members to take an active role in the governance of the organisation at the Association level.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified positive aspects of the centre‚Äôs provision for children and many continue to be evident. Fostering independence in children and more consistently high quality practices were identified as areas for development. Some progress has been made.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight playcentre reviews in the Tamaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play independently and explore their environment freely. Many are able to sustain their play over time. Parents/whƒÅnau have developed strategies so that infants and toddlers can play safely alongside older children. Adults affirm children in their play and celebrate their successes.</p><p>Bicultural practice is a strength of the centre. Parents/whƒÅnau are well supported to build their knowledge and confidence in using te reo MƒÅori with children. As a result MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau are affirmed in their language, culture and identity. Other children develop a sense of Aotearoa New Zealand as a bicultural nation.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau are welcomed into the centre. Experienced members are inclusive and affirming of new members. This helps to build both a supportive centre culture and the confidence and knowledge of new members. Centre members willingly assume positions of responsibility and provide support for emerging leadership.</p><p>Centre members report an inclusive culture at the centre. Strong whƒÅnau support provides members with benefits that extend beyond their children‚Äôs learning. Families are encouraged to use their first language in sessions and to share their culture.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau plan each term for their child‚Äôs learning. They record significant developments and ‚Äòmagic moments‚Äô in learning. These stories contribute to worthwhile portfolios that record children‚Äôs participation in activities, learning and development.</p><p>Newer members develop their confidence to notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs learning and to participate in evaluation and planning discussions. Parents/whƒÅnau use their observations to evaluate each session.</p><p>The centre benefits from long serving members filling key roles and functions. Ongoing parent education ensures the centre is self sufficient in meeting licensing requirements. A Licensing Support Worker (LSW) is employed to provide additional support and expertise focused on programmes for older children. The ongoing support of the Association liaison officer and support worker is highly valued.</p><p>Association management policies are well established. Heightening awareness of Playcentre within the community is an ongoing focus of the Association. Centre members report that the Association is very responsive to requests for support and guidance to manage the centre. The Association could now consider ways to further support centres to provide quality programmes for children, and also promote improvement in effective centres.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre office holders and ERO agree that the centre should review and develop members' capacity in some areas. These include:</p><ul>
<li>using formal self-review processes to evaluate programmes and initiatives and using an action plan to monitor progress towards development goals</li>
<li>continuing to build skills to support children‚Äôs learning through play</li>
<li>finding ways to promote critical thinking and more complex play for older children within the family sessions</li>
<li>increasing awareness and knowledge of how children can be supported within their play to develop their understanding of mathematics.</li>
</ul><p>The cluster review has identified areas of governance and management for the Association to address. These include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening strategic planning and self-review practices</li>
<li>re-establishing performance management systems for all employed staff</li>
<li>ensuring liaison officers and licensing support workers contribute more effectively to improving the quality of programmes in centres.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papatoetoe Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the centre must implement processes for:</p><ul>
<li>identifying, minimising or removing hazards in the environment</li>
<li>ensuring the provision for children‚Äôs health and safety is robust.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papatoetoe Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy chief Review Officer Northern Select Region</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
