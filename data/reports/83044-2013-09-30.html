</table><p>There is a high level of relational trust among all who are involved in the centre that allows discussion, problem solving and critical reflection.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tokomairiro Early Learning Centre is a full-day education and care service for children up to five years of age. Children play and learn together in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is based around warm, caring relationships between adults and children, and younger children learning with older children. It aims to foster children‚Äôs imagination and to support children having fun.</p><p>The centre is one of two community governed centres. As a result of opening a second centre, a new organisational structure of a governance committee, manager, and head teachers has been established. The governance committee aims to provide an early childhood service that supports the local community.</p><p>Most teachers have early childhood training. The teaching team is well established with few staff changes since the 2011 ERO review.</p><p>The 2011 ERO review, recommended that:</p><ul>
<li>records of children‚Äôs learning should make the learning clearer</li>
<li>teachers explore further ways of gathering, recording and using the aspirations parents have.</li>
</ul><p>These remain areas for ongoing development for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the positive, caring, friendly and respectful relationships they have with teachers and each other. Teachers focus on building strong relationships between the centre and the community. Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs needs and interests. They respond well to spontaneous learning opportunities provided by the children and their environment.</p><p>Children are familiar and comfortable with their teachers and freely approach them for support and direction. Children‚Äôs confidence is built through comments from the teachers that acknowledge and celebrate their efforts and successes.</p><p>Children experience and participate in a rich variety of experiences within and beyond the centre. The strong links and connections with the community enhance children‚Äôs learning. Members of the local community contribute their time and resources to support the children. As a result many children have experiences they would not necessarily have at that age.</p><p>Teachers guide children to lead their own learning and they provide resources to extend this. They take opportunities to integrate early mathematics, literacy and scientific concepts in the daily programme. Teachers and children have fun together as part of the learning process. Children up to two years of age have many good opportunities to interact and learn with older children including their siblings.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs bicultural programme is being continually strengthened. Children are increasing their bicultural awareness and knowledge of te reo MƒÅori. Te reo MƒÅori is increasingly integrated into the daily programme. ERO observed children enjoying and responding well to their te reo MƒÅori learning. This aspect of the programme provides good opportunities for all children to increase their cultural awareness.</p><p>Teachers work well together as a team. They contribute a range of good skills to enrich the programme and children‚Äôs learning. There is frequent informal dialogue between teachers about children, their achievements and the programme. This strong, supportive culture promotes children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are currently participating in professional learning and development in the assessment of children‚Äôs learning and writing of narrative stories. They need effective systems to gather, share and use information about all children‚Äôs learning from observations and from parents. Teachers are informally assessing children, however there needs to be better processes to show this and how assessment links to decisions for future learning.</p><p>The governance committee is in the early stages of clarifying the roles and responsibilities required for effective governance, management and leadership. It has begun to develop systems to support centre operations and has yet to formalise its expectations around sustainability of practice.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher have identified, and ERO agrees, that they are in the early stages of self review. They need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop their understanding of sound self-review processes and practices</li>
<li>ensure all aspects of the operations of the service are effectively reviewed over time</li>
<li>review the centre‚Äôs philosophies so that there are clear understandings about what is believed and practised at the centre. All future decision making should be linked to this.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tokomairiro Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tokomairiro Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>30 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
