</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Grey Lynn is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 42 children, including up to 18 under two years of age. Children enrolled at the centre include those who live locally and those whose parents work in the area.</p><p>The centre is part of the national BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>The centre provides for children in two age-related rooms, each with an outdoor area. Those up to two and a half years of age are in the Whare and the older children are in the Studio. A cook is employed to provide nutritious meals for the children.</p><p>The centre manager was appointed approximately a year ago. She provides professional leadership for the staff and attends to the day-to-day management of the centre. She is currently involved in recruiting head teachers for each of the rooms, and is mentoring teachers who are new to the profession. A part-time administrator is employed to assist the manager.</p><p>The philosophy that guides teaching and learning is closely aligned with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It acknowledges parents as first teachers, and the importance of working in partnership with whānau. It also recognises the role of teachers in extending children's thinking and language. A recent evaluation of the philosophy has increased the emphasis on health, and on sustaining the physical environment.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report acknowledged positive relationships in the centre, and with children's whānau. It recognised the progress being made in programme planning and management systems. Key next steps included strengthening internal evaluation and improving the education programme for older children. The new manager plans to continue work in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four early childhood reviews in the BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to benefit from positive and supportive relationships with teachers. Teachers take time to get to know the children and their families. They often have sustained conversations with children providing opportunities for developing their oral language. Increased opportunities for parents to contribute their ideas to the programme have helped to strengthen the partnership between parents and teachers.</p><p>Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play. They are able to access a wide range of resources and move freely between indoor and outdoor areas. The centre environment promotes children's interests and supports their learning. The increased focus on environmental sustainability, initiated by parents' feedback, has led to initiatives that have then led to new interests for children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for and have many opportunities to learn. Teachers talk with them frequently, allowing them to contribute to their programme. They respect children by explaining what they are doing when carrying out care routines.</p><p>Centre staff have identified that they want to strengthen their understanding about and confidence in providing a curriculum that is more reflective of bicultural Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>The transition of children from the Whare to the Studio is helped by the two areas being adjacent to one another, allowing the two age groups to communicate easily. The younger children have many opportunities to get to know teachers from the Studio.</p><p>Teachers support older children and their families to prepare for school. Where appropriate, they work with local schools to clarify expectations and ensure that children have the skills and knowledge to successfully make the transition.</p><p>The manager recognises the importance of having a centre culture where there is a shared understanding of purpose and opportunities to engage in professional conversations. Developing this culture will be a focus once the new head teachers have been appointed. The manager is exploring how staff meetings can have a greater focus on teaching and learning.</p><p>BestStart supports teachers’ professional growth well. The organisation has reviewed its appraisal system and provides targeted professional learning and development.</p><p>BestStart has useful internal evaluation systems for monitoring service operations. These include regular management meetings and an internal audit process (QEC). Centre staff also use internal evaluation to review aspects of centre operations and would benefit from further support to strengthen their evaluation practices.</p><p>The centre’s strategic plan is linked to the BestStart vision and strategic plan. Strategic planning would be strengthened by ensuring that goals are clearly stated, action plans are developed to achieve the goals and that progress towards the goals is monitored. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that areas for development for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation and strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building a professional culture with staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening partnerships with parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the curriculum so that it promotes more complex play for older children, and makes the centre's commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi more visible.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Grey Lynn completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Grey Lynn will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 April 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
