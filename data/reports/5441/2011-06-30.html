<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton is located in the North New Brighton suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates morning and afternoon sessions to provide care and education for 45 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from high quality interactions. Other positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on building effective relationships to support their learning and sense of belonging</li>
<li>a child-led programme where their decisions are valued and responded to positively</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; skills in using conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>teachers encouraging their social skills and attitudes of respect and responsibility</li>
<li>an interesting and varied learning environment with a range of activities to support their learning particularly in dramatic and imaginative play, creativity, literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>teachers regularly considering ways of improving aspects of the programme and teaching practices.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have been discussing how they can make programme planning and assessment more manageable, meaningful and visible within the kindergarten environment. They now need to carry out their plans for improvement and monitor how well these actions are improving outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">Since the on-site stage of this review, the centre buildings have been affected by the Christchurch earthquake and the kindergarten is now operating out of temporary premises. The association has been proactive in addressing issues relating to children, personnel and property.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Teachers have a shared view of children as competent and capable learners. This belief is demonstrated in the child-led programme where children&rsquo;s decisions are valued and responded to. The concept of ako (where everyone is a teacher and learner) is evident among children and teachers.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Quality of interactions</h4><p align="left">Teachers emphasise the building of effective relationships to support children&rsquo;s learning and sense of belonging. ERO observed respectful, positive and nurturing relationships between children and teachers. Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>know children and their families well and use this information to make decisions about their teaching and kindergarten practices</li>
<li>make good use of self review to reflect on and strengthen the ways they involve families in the kindergarten programme.</li>
<li>Teachers are highly skilled in using conversations with children to extend their thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers:</li>
<li>consistently use a range of questions that help children to talk about their ideas</li>
<li>use good judgement to move in and out of children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>use effective ways to help children make their play more complex.</li>
</ul><h4>Quality of programme</h4><p align="left">The programme is calm and settled with a high level of engagement by children. Children&rsquo;s play is uninterrupted. They make their own choices about when to participate in group and kai times. The programme provides good opportunities to develop self-help skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s social competence and foster respect and responsibility. They have consistent and high expectations for children&rsquo;s behaviour and learning and help children solve their own conflicts. Children successfully use turn taking, sharing and negotiation to help them play in groups for prolonged periods of time.</p><h4>The quality of the learning environment</h4><p align="left">Children learn in an interesting and varied environment with a range of activities to support their learning. Resources and activities are presented in interesting ways. During the ERO review, children&rsquo;s interests in dramatic and imaginative play, creativity and construction were well supported. Literacy and numeracy were meaningfully integrated throughout the programme.</p><h4>Self review</h4><p align="left">Teachers regularly discuss aspects of the kindergarten programme and practices. They have useful systems for identifying their areas of strength and next steps. They are using some effective self-review formats that help them focus on finding ways to improve teaching and learning.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><h4>Planning and assessment</h4><p align="left">Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that a focus on strengthening programme planning and assessment is their next step. The new team of teachers is beginning to discuss and develop ideas on how they can make programme planning and assessment more manageable, meaningful and visible in the kindergarten environment. They now need to carry out their plans for improvement and monitor how well these actions are improving outcomes for children.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><p align="left">this kindergarten understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the kindergarten;</p><ul>
<li>managers and teachers have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children; and</li>
<li>this kindergarten works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">This kindergarten has 17 M&#257;ori children attending whose parents/wh&#257;nau have identified them as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">The teachers have a commitment to biculturalism. M&#257;ori children experience an environment where their culture is respected and they develop a sense of belonging.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">The teachers have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">a focus on inclusion and building effective relationships based on teachers&rsquo; knowledge of each family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">completed a recent self review of partnerships with wh&#257;nau that identified a range of ways to support communication and help involve wh&#257;nau more in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">displayed M&#257;ori symbols and imagery visible in the environment to create a sense of inclusion and welcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">used the association&rsquo;s recent development of &lsquo;Kidsfirst Wh&#257;nau&rsquo; - a wh&#257;nau-based approach for involving and engaging parents in kindergarten life and their child&rsquo;s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p align="left">The teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that their next step is to extend the range of strategies they use to involve parents and wh&#257;nau in the programme and assessment practices.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-north-new-brighton" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton is located in the North New Brighton suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates morning and afternoon sessions to provide care and education for 45 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from high quality interactions. Other positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on building effective relationships to support their learning and sense of belonging</li>
<li>a child-led programme where their decisions are valued and responded to positively</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; skills in using conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>teachers encouraging their social skills and attitudes of respect and responsibility</li>
<li>an interesting and varied learning environment with a range of activities to support their learning particularly in dramatic and imaginative play, creativity, literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>teachers regularly considering ways of improving aspects of the programme and teaching practices.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have been discussing how they can make programme planning and assessment more manageable, meaningful and visible within the kindergarten environment. They now need to carry out their plans for improvement and monitor how well these actions are improving outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">Since the on-site stage of this review, the centre buildings have been affected by the Christchurch earthquake and the kindergarten is now operating out of temporary premises. The association has been proactive in addressing issues relating to children, personnel and property.</p></html>
