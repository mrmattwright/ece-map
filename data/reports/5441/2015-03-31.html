</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton is one of 62 kindergartens governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. All Kidsfirst Kindergartens share a common vision and values.</p><p>Children from two years old to school age can attend kindergarten for up to six hours a day during the four kindergarten terms.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the kindergarten‚Äôs roll has dropped due to the changed demographics in the area. Teachers have strengthened the way they share and involve parents and children in the planning and assessment of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 18 kindergarten reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs culture is inclusive and welcoming. Contributions from parents and the community are welcomed and valued to support and extend children‚Äôs learning experiences. Teachers know the children and their families well.</p><p>Teachers use practices that foster children‚Äôs sense of belonging, identity and leadership. Children‚Äôs diverse needs are well met by the kindergarten‚Äôs staff and external advisers.</p><p>Teachers thoughtfully integrate literacy, mathematics and bicultural practices, into children's learning. Natural materials and sustainable practices such as gardening, looking after animals and baking, also support the programme.</p><p>The inside and outside areas of the kindergarten inspire and challenge children‚Äôs curiosity, investigation and learning. These areas are well ordered and thoughtfully resourced to reflect te¬†ao¬†MƒÅori (the MƒÅori world view).</p><p>Children have rich and creative learning experiences. Teachers highly value and actively respond to children‚Äôs ideas for their learning. Children are seen as independent thinkers and are carefully supported to solve their own problems.</p><p>Transition practices meet the needs of each child and her/his family. This supports children and parents to feel confident and secure coming into the kindergarten and when moving on to school.</p><p>The head teacher, with the support of the Education Support Manager, provides strong leadership. Teachers are highly reflective and work well together. They share each other‚Äôs strengths and skills to enrich children‚Äôs learning.</p><h4>The Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association</h4><p>All kindergartens in this cluster have spacious indoor and outdoor areas and are well resourced to meet the interests and learning needs of their children. In most of these kindergartens, environments and resources:</p><ul>
<li>encourage children‚Äôs critical thought, wonderment and inquiry</li>
<li>provide challenges, stimulation and social support for children, families and the wider communities</li>
<li>promote opportunities for children to learn about sustainable practices.</li>
</ul><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens provide significant support for priority learners and their families. Teachers in kindergartens with priority learners receive considerable extra training and funding to ensure the needs of these learners are well met.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens has a strong commitment to te ao MƒÅori (the MƒÅori world view) and ensuring that their Education Service Managers (ESMs) and teachers are competent and confident in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. In this cluster of kindergartens, a bicultural curriculum is in place and bicultural practices are highly evident. The contribution from parents of MƒÅori children is highly valued and MƒÅori children are well supported to achieve success as MƒÅori.</p><p>The association has a well-understood vision, and highly effective strategic and annual planning systems, policies and procedures. It has strong leadership and collaboration across all levels of the organisation.</p><p>There is a thorough and well-understood process of self review at all levels of Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The skills and knowledge of the CEO, board and senior leaders are regularly sought by other kindergarten associations and early childhood services nationally and internationally.</p><p>The highly experienced and skilled trustees bring a good range of expertise to support their decision making. They have a wide knowledge and understanding of Kidsfirst and are very focused on achieving their goals. Their priorities are strongly linked to providing high-quality learning and care for all children.</p><p>The strategic leadership team members have a good breadth and depth of knowledge across their various areas of expertise. They value each other‚Äôs contributions and use their wide range of knowledge and skills to ensure effective operation of the service.</p><p>The ESMs show a high level of commitment to Kidsfirst and the implementation of the Kidsfirst vision, policies and expectations. They successfully challenge and use each other's strengths to meet the goals of Kidsfirst for high-quality learning and teaching in each kindergarten.</p><p>Kidsfirst has a well-developed evaluation process that is effectively used to identify the strengths, progress and areas for further development in each of its kindergartens. This allows the ESMs to successfully monitor how well each kindergarten is providing high-quality outcomes for children.</p><p>High-quality professional development is closely aligned to leaders and teachers achieving the Kidsfirst vision and goals. In this cluster, this is most evident in the well-developed, understood and useful self-review processes, child assessment and planning practices and effective use of a range of technologies.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Kidsfirst Kindergartens‚Äô managers have identified, and ERO agrees that the key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>to further align the existing appraisal process for ESMs, head teachers and teachers to recent developments in Kidsfirst Kindergartens' quality improvement programme ensuring it is consistently achieving its vision to provide high-quality learning and teaching for all children</li>
<li>to continue to review kindergarten practices and premises to make sure that they meet the changing needs of their communities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens North New Brighton will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern Southern Region</p><p>31 March 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.
