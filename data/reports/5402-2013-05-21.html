<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Nayland Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Nayland Kindergarten is situated in a community of educational facilities that includes a primary, intermediate and high school. The teaching team has been together for three years. It is licensed for 44 children aged two years and over. The kindergarten has gained a bronze enviroschool award. Teachers value information and communication technologies as tools for learning.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to the reviews of eight early childhood education centres within the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Partnerships among parents, wh&#257;nau, community and teachers are based on respect and understanding. All contribute to the design of the programme. A family liaison group actively supports the kindergarten community.</p><p>There is a focus on sustainability. The well integrated curriculum fosters a busy and purposeful environment. The tone is conducive to learning. Teachers understand each child as a unique learner. The kindergarten&rsquo;s vision is evident in practice.</p><p>Teachers place a high value on children actively learning through play. They interact positively with them and are responsive, caring and sensitive to their needs. High quality interactions are evident. Teaching strategies encourage independence, leadership, social development, challenge and critical thinking. Children test their own working theories and language development is fostered.</p><p>The programme is child and teacher initiated with opportunities for children to co-create their learning. Chances for children to be creative and imaginative in meaningful ways are highly evident. Tuakana teina learning is actively promoted. Teachers support development of social and emotional competence and see children as confident and competent learners. Children have ample opportunities to engage in sustained play.</p><p>There is a well considered approach to support children and their parents with transitions to school. Teachers work with parents and external agencies to support children with additional learning needs. Inclusive practice is promoted. Children have many opportunities to explore and use te reo M&#257;ori. Teachers are committed to continuing to use te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori across the curriculum. The curriculum is clearly linked to the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki.</em></p><p>Children&rsquo;s profiles are well presented. Teachers describe the learning and identify what is going well. Children have ownership of their own profiles and many children revisit their learning which is documented in a variety of ways within them. Parents views are actively sought and teachers&rsquo; endeavour to show learning over time within the profiles.</p><p>The association has recently updated its appraisal procedures to provide clear guidance for staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to support its successful implementation.</p><p>Teachers are supported in their understanding of self review by the association. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Spontaneous and regular review has been well used to improve outcomes for children.&nbsp; The teachers and association are highly consultative, regularly requesting feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust self review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practice</li>
<li>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides strong support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are supported to enact the association&rsquo;s vision of providing &ldquo;consistently exceptional early childhood education&rdquo;.</p><p>Equity funding is used effectively to support positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Key Next Steps</h4><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing</li>
<li>continue to strengthen documentation in the learning stories to show how learning is deepened for children and how parents changing aspirations are being acknowledged to further enhance children's learning over time.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nayland Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>21 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
