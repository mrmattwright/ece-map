</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Havelock North Playcentre operates six sessions a week, including a whƒÅnau session from 3.30pm until 6.30pm on Friday. Families of enrolled children are encouraged to participate in this session.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on child-initiated, adult-supported play. Educating parents to enable them to meet the learning needs of the children is a high priority for centre members.</p><p>Since the December 2011 ERO report there has been a significant increase in the number of children attending. Members have focused on fundraising and increasing the profile of the playcentre. They have invested a lot of time making physical and operational improvements to the centre.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 playcentre reviews in the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong, responsive and respectful relationships are evident in the playcentre. Children are confident to initiate their own learning. They take risks and play collaboratively. Infants have appropriate areas for play. Resources are appropriate for them across the curriculum. Routines are sociable for children and adults. A sense of belonging is very evident.</p><p>Children and their parents lead and contribute their perspectives to the design of the centre‚Äôs curriculum. The early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, is evident in practice. Children are understood by adults within the context of their family. Adults respond meaningfully to the interests of infants, toddlers and young children. They support their learning through conversations and providing relevant experiences.</p><p>Parents are reflective. Through assessment, planning and evaluation they provide quality learning for children. Ongoing observations by adults build a picture of what children know, understand, are interested in and can do. Children confidently revisit and share learning with others.</p><p>Families recognise the unique culture that MƒÅori children and their families bring to the centre. Acknowledgement of local hap≈´ and iwi, their history and sites of significance is incorporated into the programme in a meaningful and respectful manner. The environment, resources and practices reflect the centre‚Äôs commitment to te ao MƒÅori. MƒÅori Initiative Funding is used to support whƒÅnau for the benefit of children.</p><p>Self review for improvement is ongoing and becoming an embedded practice. There is a culture of enquiry, focused on positive outcomes for children. A recent development as a result of self review has been the appointment of a session facilitator. The impact of the facilitator‚Äôs work is evident in the playcentre. Documenting assessment for learning, role-modelling child-initiated, adult-supported play, and mentoring members to engage in quality interactions with children, have been positive improvements.</p><p>Playcentre leaders champion this place. They show a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the service. The vision, philosophy and direction are informed by the association, and parents at Havelock North Playcentre have personalised it and made it their own. Leaders ensure the vision and goals are focused on children‚Äôs learning. Expectations about their involvement in the playcentre are made very clear for parents. The welcome pack was recently revised to reflect these expectations. A team approach is evident with a focus on ensuring that children experience success. Professional learning conversations are evident as parents work collaboratively to make children‚Äôs playcentre experiences positive.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>Parents are establishing good processes for self review. Members should continue to develop self review to enquire into and evaluate the effectiveness of policies, programmes and practices to promote positive outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Many children transition to other early childhood centres before moving on to school. Parents share their knowledge and support each other to ensure children experience a smooth transition. Most children go on to attend one of the three local schools. Parents should consider how to strengthen the partnership between the playcentre and schools and make links between <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Havelock North Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To meets its accountability in relation to employment of staff in this playcentre, the association must:</p><ul>
<li>put systems in place to ensure all personnel who are required to be, are police vetted¬†<em>[Education Act 1989, s319D]</em></li>
<li>ensure there is a regular cycle of appraisal. [<em>Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GM7]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Havelock North Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
