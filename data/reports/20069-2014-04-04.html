</table><p>Highbury Community Crèche provides high quality early childhood education that promotes the wellbeing and learning of all the children attending.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Highbury Community Crèche is part of the Highbury House Community Centre. The crèche caters for 25 children per session from birth to school age. The crèche has an extensive waiting list and offers both morning and afternoon mixed age sessions. At present, 108 children are on the roll. The philosophy of the crèche has recently been reviewed. It emphasises teachers’ focus on strong relationships in their work with children, each other and parents. It also reflects teachers’ strong professional knowledge which is evident in their teaching practice.</p><p>The centre operates as an incorporated society governed by a committee of parents. The centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the crèche and a lead teacher takes responsibility for guiding curriculum practises. The majority of teachers hold teaching qualifications and are fully registered.</p><p>Teachers use a wide range of resources to support the programme. The crèche caters for a predominantly NZ European/Pākehā community. A small number of Māori, Asian and children from other cultures represent the cultural diversity in the community.</p><p>Since ERO’s previous very positive report, there has been a focus on strengthening self-review processes to evaluate and continue to improve the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Well developed partnerships established with families enable children to settle confidently into the centre. Teachers welcome children and their families in warmly nurturing ways making time to engage everyone in friendly and professional conversations. Families’ sense of belonging in the centre is highly evident and children respond with trust to teachers.</p><p>The teaching team works effectively with children. They are confident and calm, encouraging tuakana/teina relationships in the mixed-age group of children. There are delightful instances of help between older and younger children and the play is inclusive and friendly. Younger children are well integrated, receiving close attention and support from teachers for independent play. The ratio of teachers to children is favourable and the day is planned with few set routines. Children receive caring attention and are enthusiastic about being in the centre.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in the programme staying for considerable periods at activities, experimenting and revisiting previous interests. Teachers provide a broad range of activities and experiences that are carefully planned to cater for children’s strengths and age abilities. As a result, children demonstrate concentration and pleasure in their learning. A strong focus on children selecting and managing their own play increases their independence.</p><p>Children and teachers talk together in meaningful ways. These conversations are often about what children are doing and prompt sharing of ideas about resources that could extend play. Teachers use open questions to encourage children’s responses and consciously extend vocabulary. The print and photograph rich wall displays- set up at children’s level- stimulate and promote further interest and conversations.</p><p>Teachers take considerable care to provide an interactive, uncluttered and appealing learning environment that provides well for the different ages of children attending each session. They make good use of the outdoor areas to create space for additional activities. Teachers give priority to activities that will encourage children’s exploration and extend their learning. Activities and prompts allow children to make sense of literacy, numeracy and scientific concepts.</p><p>Teachers use comprehensive self-review processes to evaluate the effectiveness and value of their programmes. They have a focus on continuously improving their practises to support children’s learning. A year-long review has strengthened teachers’ commitment to providing sound bicultural learning for children and to forging partnerships with Māori families attending the centre. Teachers’ review has included professional development, and establishing relationships with a local marae.</p><p>The centre has a sound policy and management framework. Meetings are regular and members receive updates about the programme in action. Committee members have a strong sense of contribution and they know that their work for the centre is valued and useful.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the teaching team discussed and agreed on the next steps for the centre. Changes in the community are having an impact on the age of children attending. Teachers intend to focus their professional learning on providing challenge for older children in the programme and continuing to work on bicultural practices. They will continue to use self review to gauge the quality of their documentation and the effectiveness of learning programmes.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Highbury Community Crèche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Highbury Community Crèche will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
