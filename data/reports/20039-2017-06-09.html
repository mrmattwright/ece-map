</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Daystar Early Learning Centre is a small centre in Mt Eden that provides education and care for up to 35 children over two years of age. The centre operates as part of the Eden Community Church and is governed by a board of trustees. Two newly appointed managers are responsible for daily centre operations, and lead the teaching team. The centre's philosophy and programmes include Christian beliefs and values.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted that the centre required external support to improve the quality of governance, management, and teaching and learning. The report recommended that the Ministry of Education work alongside the board and managers to provide advice and professional development training.</p><p>Since 2015, positive changes have been made to governance, management and centre leadership. A new governance board has been appointed. In May 2016 a consultant was appointed to work in a professional advisory capacity. This advisor was then appointed to the role of centre manager in September 2016. She is working systematically, in collaboration with staff, to address gaps in practice and the non-compliance areas identified by ERO in 2015.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The recently refurbished learning environment is thoughtfully resourced to facilitate children's engagement, exploration and curiosity. Teachers recognise children's high levels of social competence, language skills and comprehension. Many children speak English in addition to their first languages.</p><p>Children participate well in mixed-age play. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident. Children are kind, include others during play and affirm each other's sharing of ideas.</p><p>Teachers are gentle and calm with children. They respect children as active participants in learning. Children are increasingly well supported by teachers to be independent thinkers who solve problems, question and reflect on their own thinking.</p><p>Teachers have made a good start with using te reo Māori as part of the programme. Mat times have a deliberate emphasis on promoting te reo. Managers recognise that there should be a stronger commitment to implementing bicultural practices.</p><p>Natural learning environments are inspired by Reggio Emilia philosophical approaches. Reggio values of respect, responsibility and whānau/community involvement are now features of the programme. Managers mentor teachers and build their professional knowledge about how effective learning environments provide choices and opportunities that support children's learning.</p><p>The centre's transition-to-school programme has an appropriate focus on developing children's skills for collaboration, research and enquiry. Programmes include literacy, numeracy and science experiences. Good assistance is provided for children needing additional support to benefit from the programme.</p><p>The new centre manager is working alongside teachers to help them implement and value new teaching approaches that promote positive learning outcomes for children. Professional development has rekindled teachers' enthusiasm for their role in nurturing children's thinking and learning. Useful assessment and evaluation practices are beginning to improve teachers' planning for learning and to focus more clearly on children's strengths, interests and learning dispositions.</p><p>A long-term plan identifies strategic priorities and is supported by an annual plan. Policies and procedures have been reviewed and quality management systems introduced. Financial procedures are now more clearly articulated. Self review is becoming embedded and has resulted in many improvements. Strong leadership and staff commitment support the sustainability of these improvements.</p><p>Leadership influence is becoming more evident in the centre. The predominantly new board, led by a new chair, is learning about the attributes of high quality teaching and learning. The board is also becoming more aware of how decisions at board level can contribute to the growth of staff and improved learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers have identified appropriate goals to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>add more complexity to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan more frequently for the needs and interests of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make clearer links between the centre's philosophy, strategic plans and children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Important next steps are to monitor progress towards strategic goals and evaluate the impact of changes on outcomes for children. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Daystar Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Daystar Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>9 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
