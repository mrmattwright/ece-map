</table><p>Tuahiwi Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tuahiwi Community Preschool is a rural, not-for-profit centre. It is governed and supported by an elected parent committee. The centre manager has overall responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre. There have been a number of management and staff changes since the last ERO review.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for children from two years old to school age in two spacious rooms. There is a well-designed, shared outdoor area.</p><p>All teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. Some staff have been at the centre for long periods of time. They are supported by a full-time supervisor, who is the curriculum leader, and three teacher aides.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, centre leaders and teachers have further developed programme planning, implemented a new self-review process and appraisal system. They continue to work on encouraging greater child and parent voice in learning stories and programme planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have positive, respectful relationships with their teachers. They are very settled and actively involved in their learning programme. Children play well together for long periods of time. They have many opportunities to explore their interests and ideas from the wide range of learning activities provided.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming, inclusive environment for children and families. They are actively involved in children's play and effectively support those with additional needs. Teachers foster children's independence skills and positively encourage them to manage their own learning behaviour.</p><p>Teachers link children's learning goals to programme planning. Individual teachers support others to meaningfully incorporate te reo and tikanga Māori in learning programmes.</p><p>The centre has well-resourced indoor and outside environments. Teachers carefully present easily accessible equipment to challenge children and encourage their participation. They include resources that foster children's experience of the natural world.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are flexible and responsive to the individual needs of children and their families. Centre leaders and teachers have built close links with several local schools to support transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are building a range of ways to actively involve parents in learning partnerships. They communicate regularly with parents about their child's learning, centre events and operations.</p><p>The new staff appraisal process is in the early stages of implementation. Centre leaders make good use of extensive, external professional development to support and improve teaching practices and centre processes. They have made valuable links with local and community groups.</p><p>Leaders appropriately use individual teacher strengths and interests to support each other's practice. They are beginning to use self review processes to reflect on their practices and make considered changes to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to strengthen the:</p><ul>
<li>inclusion of bicultural concepts in key centre documentation</li>
<li>self review process and show links to the strategic plan and appraisal</li>
<li>ways teachers identify children's learning in profile books and record children's and parent's ideas in learning stories</li>
<li>ways teachers evaluate learning and teaching practices to improve learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>appointments and appraisal policies and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tuahiwi Community Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>24 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
