</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Apii Potiki Glen Innes Community Pre-School is family owned and operated. The service is licensed to provide education and care for 50 children, including up to 10 aged under two years. Infants and toddlers have their own separate play space. Children attend sessions similar to school hours.</p><p>The centre managers, and head teacher work together to ensure the smooth operation of the centre. Since opening in May 2013 they have worked to establish and maintain relationships within the early childhood sector and the local and wider business and Cook Islands communities. Seven qualified teachers make up the teaching team. The Apii Potiki Reo Kuki Airani Preschool Trust has a governance role. This is the service's first ERO review.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes and encourages recognition, respect and appreciation for the cultural values, language and customs of the Cook Islands. It strongly foregrounds families, relationships, respect for all, partnerships, bicultural practice and growth. Centre personnel, alongside the parents and whānau of an increasingly culturally diverse community, continue to review the philosophy statement to ensure it embraces the aspirations of a changing community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The values that underpin the service's philosophy are strongly evident in practice. Children and families of all cultures have a sense of belonging in the centre environment. They are affirmed in their culture, and as individuals.</p><p>Children are friendly. They confidently approach adults and each other for conversation, to question and for support. They are engaged, happy and having fun. Teachers positively interact with children, follow their lead and become partners in play.</p><p>Children are curious and competent. They are able to sustain their play in small groups or on their own. Teachers are perceptive to the diverse needs of individual children. They respond well to children's conversations and model language and new vocabulary. The environment is literacy rich and reflects children's stories. Effective teaching practice promotes positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are sensitively cared for by teachers who respond to their cues and support their decisions. Children settle quickly into a spacious environment that encourages exploration and discovery. The calm pace maintained by teachers allows children the time they need to make choices.</p><p>A bicultural partnership is promoted alongside the language and culture of the Cook Islands. Karakia and waiata and their cultural equivalents feature strongly, particularly at group times. Children are provided with opportunities to see and hear at least three languages on a regular basis.</p><p>The "mamas and papas" (grandparents) present throughout the sessions play a significant role in bringing the Cook Islands culture and language to life. They contribute to the heart of the centre, bringing a depth of knowledge of their culture to share with others.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO shared how highly they value what this centre provides for their children and the support for their families. The response of teachers and centre leaders to the diverse needs of children have promoted very positive outcomes for them within the centre, within the community, and in transitions to school.</p><p>Teachers plan a programme for children based on their interests and strengths. Children's emerging interests are identified through daily recordings of their engagement with resources and through conversations. Attractively presented portfolios of children's learning are individual, family centred, and present a holistic view of the child's learning.</p><p>Teachers and leaders choose relevant topics for internal evaluation focussed on lifting teaching practice and strengthening positive outcomes for children. This process could be improved through the use of research in findings and more evaluative questions to guide review practices.</p><p>Centre leaders promote and use good systems for accountability. They are deliberate, proactive and considered in supporting and encouraging continuous improvement, and in strengthening their links to their community. Teachers are given good opportunities to engage in relevant professional learning and development. They participate well in robust discussions about their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that in order to strengthen their current good practice, key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to implement and refine systems of programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>a review of how effectively the resourcing and layout of the outdoor environment extends children's play and provides challenges to their thinking</li>
<li>continuing to refine the process of strategic planning, evaluating and monitoring progress against strategic goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Apii Potiki Glen Innes Community Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Apii Potiki Glen Innes Community Pre-School will be in three years. </p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>31 August 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
