</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community of Early Learning Ltd is a well maintained, purpose-built, privately-owned centre in suburban Palmerston North. The service is licensed to provide all day education and care for 40 children, including 13 up to two years old. Of the 48 children enrolled, four are MƒÅori. Thoughtfully organised, separate learning areas cater for the needs of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>The centre owner has appointed a head teacher to oversee the day-to-day running of the service. Eight teachers have an early childhood qualification and six have full teacher certification. One teacher has provisional certification and is receiving a coaching programme.</p><p>Since the July 2013 ERO report, leaders and teachers have made some progress in strengthening internal evaluation, assessment and planning and te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. These areas continue to require further refinement and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is successfully reflected in practice. Teachers support learners to follow their interests. They encourage children‚Äôs language development, mathematical understanding and sustained attention to both child-initiated and adultinitiated activities. Young children welcome opportunities to actively explore, talk about, and participate in, these experiences.</p><p>The programmes, environment and resources provide children with an inviting range of learning experiences. Their involvement in everyday activities is increasingly celebrated and shared between teachers and parents. Leaders should continue to establish with teachers shared understandings that determine curriculum priorities and emphases. This development should include strengthening analysis of assessment information to reflect deepening and growing significance of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Infants are encouraged to become active communicators and explorers. Programme provision for these very young learners focuses on fostering their wellbeing through responsive caregiving. Care routines are unhurried and an important and enjoyable part of children‚Äôs learning experiences. Play is viewed as an opportunity for learning.</p><p>Teachers increasingly incorporate te ao MƒÅori into the programme as a part of children‚Äôs daily experiences. A confident staff member role models and provides, for colleagues, valuable support in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and bicultural practices. Programmes for children include MƒÅori concepts, knowledge, customs, values and beliefs.</p><p>Leaders have developed a new appraisal process that is yet to be fully implemented. It has developmental aspects and the potential to increase professional learning opportunities for teachers. Further exploration of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> should enhance teaching practice and understanding of a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes continue to evolve. The head teacher and teachers are reflective. They are developing understanding of review for improvement. Strategic planning requires strengthening. The focus of annual planning is on centre operation and broad teaching and learning objectives. Consideration should be given to developing a plan that identifies priorities and associated goals to further strengthen centre operation and teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree on the following key next steps:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop and improve understandings of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider further ways of introducing culturally responsive practices for MƒÅori and Pacific learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement the new appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community of Early Learning Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice management must record earthquake drills carried out with children.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community of Early Learning Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
