</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>An-Nur Childcare Centre Dunedin opened in April 2014 and is located in South Dunedin. It is the only Muslim-based centre in Dunedin. The centre offers education and care for Muslim and non-Muslim children from birth to school age. The roll is steadily increasing.</p><p>The centre priorities are to uphold Islamic traditions, nurture the whole child (spirit, mind and body), and develop children‚Äôs knowledge of Arabic language. These priorities are strongly evident in the programme.¬†</p><p>The children and their teachers come from diverse cultural and language backgrounds. This diversity is valued. In addition, teachers encourage children to be confident in New Zealand's culture. For most children English is their second language. The centre is an important point of social contact for parents, especially those new to New Zealand. Teachers also provide practical support for families.</p><p>This centre is one of two centres under the Al Noor Charitable Trust. A sister centre based in Christchurch has been operating since 2000. The Christchurch-based manager visits regularly.¬†</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs wellbeing is nurtured. The teachers know the children and their families well and have established caring and trusting relationships with them. The children play and learn in a settled atmosphere. Routines are well established, helping children know what to expect and when.</p><p>Teachers place a strong focus on supporting children to develop appropriate social skills.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum is built around:</p><ul>
<li>Islamic beliefs and values</li>
<li>Te WhƒÅriki (the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum)</li>
<li>aspects of the Montessori approach</li>
<li>parents‚Äô wishes for their child‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>All of these influences are evident in the day-to-day programme. Teachers recognise that there are some challenges in accommodating these different influences. They have identified that a next step is to look more closely at their centre philosophy and what they want this to look like in practice.</p><p>Teachers place a strong focus on children‚Äôs early literacy in English and Arabic. These priorities reflect parents‚Äô wishes and the trust‚Äôs goals. The trust has employed a specialist teacher who plans, teaches and monitors children‚Äôs progress in Arabic language and teaches aspects of the Islamic faith. Children also have meaningful opportunities for mathematics learning.¬†</p><p>The children speak a range of languages. Their teachers encourage them to use their first languages with each other. Teachers also use children‚Äôs first language to support them to learn English. The teachers and parents have identified that learning English is an important goal for many children. The teachers and ERO agree that the next step is for the teachers to explore more deeply how to best support children‚Äôs English language development.</p><p>Teachers have quickly established useful systems for planning and assessment. In the best examples:</p><ul>
<li>children‚Äôs learning goals are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>goals (including parents‚Äô aspirations) are responded to in learning stories</li>
<li>stories show how teachers supported children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>learning stories show individual children‚Äôs progress over time.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use technology well to involve and inform parents about their children‚Äôs learning. Each month they update parents about their children‚Äôs learning. They hold informal and formal discussions with parents about their children‚Äôs learning and set individual learning goals.</p><p>Group planning is based on Te WhƒÅriki and Islamic beliefs. Plans include experiences and activities to extend children‚Äôs knowledge and interests in areas such as science. Teachers reflect on how well the plans were achieved and on their own role in promoting learning. Children under two have their own play area and the teachers plan specific activities for them.</p><p>In a short time the manager and teachers have put in place effective systems and practices for the smooth operation of the centre. This includes a strategic plan that clearly identifies priorities for the centre‚Äôs future development.¬†</p><p>The manager and head teacher regularly communicate with each other. The Christchurch-based manager:</p><ul>
<li>provides useful support and advice and monitors the centre‚Äôs operations</li>
<li>supports the development of shared leadership in the centre</li>
<li>ensures that teachers benefit from relevant professional learning.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers share and value each other‚Äôs individual strengths and work well as a team.</p><p>The manager and regular teachers have a good understanding of the function of self review. Since opening they have regularly carried out small reviews to improve how they support and care for the children. They have chosen relevant topics for future planned reviews.</p><p>Other next steps for the centre‚Äôs development include:</p><ul>
<li>making the reporting and monitoring systems more formal</li>
<li>further developing the appraisal system so that it focuses more on growing best teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service's systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>While on site ERO discussed with the manager several practices that could be improved. These included frequency of earthquake and fire drills and strengthening risk-management plans.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of An-Nur Childcare Centre Dunedin will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
