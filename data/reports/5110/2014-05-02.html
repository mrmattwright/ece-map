</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Titirangi Kindergarten is located behind the well known Lopdell House in Titirangi. It provides early childhood education for up to 40 children from around two and a half years to school age. Families have the option of enrolling their child for six hour days or for selected session times.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>The past three years has been a time of change for the kindergarten. Since the 2010 ERO review, there have been several acting head teachers, and a permanent head teacher has been recently appointed. She joins a teaching team of two other new teachers. There are a significant number of new children, including several children under three years of age.</p><p>The new PSM has supported kindergarten operations, managed changes to the teaching team and provided teachers with professional development on self review. The philosophy has been reviewed and includes a focus on environmental sustainability. This focus features prominently in resources for the outdoor environment and in parts of the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to develop their social and emotional competence. They experience positive relationships with caring teachers who help them settle quickly. Children benefit from a welcoming, calm atmosphere that promotes their wellbeing. Families are warmly welcomed at the kindergarten and often stay for extended periods of time.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate good quality teaching practices. Children‚Äôs decisions are affirmed by teachers who value their contributions. They listen to children and find ways to help children play cooperatively and collaboratively.</p><p>The child-led programme allows children to engage in sustained learning. Literacy, the natural world and early numeracy are well promoted. The attractive learning environment and plentiful resourcing interests children. Teachers are well placed to extend children‚Äôs learning through fostering more complex conversations and through focusing on the exploration strand of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are effectively supported. Teachers work closely with families to ensure an inclusive and considerate approach. Children‚Äôs transitions into the kindergarten are carefully managed. Developing relationships with local schools could help ensure that children transition confidently to school.</p><p>Currently there are no children enrolled who identity as MƒÅori. While this is unusual for the kindergarten, teachers are engaged in professional development to strengthen the bicultural and multiethnic aspects of the programme. Revisiting the kaupapa of the environmental approach and increasing teacher‚Äôs use of te reo MƒÅori in the programme could benefit all children.</p><p>Assessment portfolios are attractive records of children‚Äôs engagement in the programme. They contain some very good examples of learning stories that analyse children‚Äôs learning. Teachers could use these good practice examples to promote meaningful learning opportunities for individual children in the daily programme. Documenting children‚Äôs progress over time and recording how teachers have responded to parent aspirations are worthwhile focus points for the new team.</p><p>Teachers understanding and use of self review is developing. Useful support from the PSM informs the kindergarten‚Äôs self review and decision making. Improvements to the management and organisation of the kindergarten are evident.</p><p>Performance management is now aligned with the registered teachers‚Äô criteria. As part of work to build a collaborative team culture, teachers could now develop a shared understanding of effective teaching practice.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to provide strong governance for kindergartens.¬† The association continues to expand its strategies to build professional leadership across the organisation. It has diversified the delivery of professional learning and development to keep teachers up-to-date with current theory and initiatives. Teaching teams are well supported by the AKA to continue to strengthen quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that next steps for the kindergarten should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing the centre strategic plan by linking goals to specific outcomes for children and using measurable indicators to guide evaluative self review</li>
<li>connecting teacher‚Äôs appraisal with strategic and annual goals</li>
<li>strengthening the links between planning, assessment and evaluation to extend learning for individual children, particularly for four year old boys.</li>
</ul><p>The 2014 review of the AKA strategic plan should provide an effective way for kindergarten staff to contribute to the ongoing development of the association.¬†¬†</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Titirangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review, ERO identified one area of non-compliance. To address this, the service provider must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure all safe-fall surfaces comply with New Zealand Standards¬†<em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF5]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Titirangi Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>2 May 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand.
