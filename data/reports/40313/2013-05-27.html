<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is working towards being well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>This is the first ERO report for Olive Tree Education and Care Centre, which previously operated as Lollipops Educare Bayfair. The centre was purchased by Bethlehem Early Learning Centres (BELC) Ltd in 2011 and is governed by that company which operates under the umbrella of the Christian Education Trust.</p><p>The centre is located in close proximity to the Bayfair shopping centre and Baywave Pool, opposite the Catholic primary school. It is licensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> to cater for 70 children, including 25 under two years of age.</p><p>Considerable change and development is continuing under new ownership and management. There has been leadership restructuring and a new head teacher, responsible for the overall management of the centre, was appointed in September 2012. The centre now operates two areas for children, under three years and those over this age. Considerable work has been done to improve the outdoor environment. Teachers have been undertaking professional development in relationship building to strengthen staff culture.</p><p>Centre managers and teachers are developing networks with the local community, designed to enrich learning and care for children. Christian values, in keeping with the ethos of the BELC, are being fostered and are already evident in the developing programme and environment.</p><p>Parents are made to feel welcome in the centre. They can easily access their child&rsquo;s individual portfolio and share in learning and programme activities if they wish.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is benefiting from sound management and governance structures provided by BELC. The head teacher is well supported and guided by the company manager/licensee to implement policies and procedural guidelines to ensure that the centre meets legislative requirements. This well established governance structure has been instrumental in supporting centre development during a period of much change.</p><p>The head teacher is beginning to provide clear direction as he becomes established in this role. He is ably supported by the senior teacher who leads the under three area. Under his leadership, some self review is being undertaken by the teaching teams as they reflect on aspects of the programme and environment. The development of an agreed philosophy about learning and teaching must be given absolute priority to bring about consistency and to focus professional learning and development for teachers. There is a structured appraisal process for teachers. When consistently implemented this process has the potential to support teachers&rsquo; professional development.</p><p>The programme provided by teachers successfully combines both teacher and child-initiated activity. Children are able to move freely about the environment, make choices from a range of activities and play equipment, and return to a favourite area of play. Some teachers engage children in purposeful play through learning conversations and problem solving. Teachers observe children&rsquo;s learning in play and record significant events in learning stories that are placed in their individual portfolios. Parents and children enjoy accessing these very visual records of learning and development. The head teacher acknowledges that more use could be made of these learning stories by teachers in programme review and planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Following in-depth discussion and observations, centre managers, leaders and ERO agreed on the following priority areas for development:</p><ul>
<li>The head teacher should lead a process of review and development of an agreed curriculum philosophy that is informed by current best practice and research.</li>
<li>Management should provide a programme of ongoing professional learning and development for teachers. This programme should be designed to build their knowledge and confidence, enabling them to consistently implement agreed practice for teaching and learning (the philosophy).</li>
<li>Professional learning should be aligned with the appraisal process through specific, cross-centre goals that focus teachers on their learning and development.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Olive Tree Education and Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>27 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
